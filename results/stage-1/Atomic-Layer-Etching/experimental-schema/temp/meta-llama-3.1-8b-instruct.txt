This schema includes the following properties:

*   `directionality`: The desired directionality of the etch process (anisotropic or isotropic).
*   `reactants`: An array of chemicals used in the etching process, each represented by an object with `name` and `formula` properties.
*   `temperature_window`: An object representing the temperature range for optimal etch rate, with `min_temp` and `max_temp` properties.
*   `ion_energy_window`: An object representing the ion energy range for optimal etch rate, with `min_ion_energy` and `max_ion_energy` properties.
*   `uniformity`: An object representing the uniformity of the etch process, with `etch_rate_variability` and `material_property_uniformity` properties. The latter is an array of material property objects, each represented by an object with `name` and `value` properties.
*   `selectivity`: An object representing the selectivity of the etch process, with a single `material_selectivity` property that is an array of material objects, each represented by an object with `name` and `composition` properties. The composition is an array of composition objects, each represented by an object with `element` and `percentage` properties.
*   `post_etch_surface`: An object representing the properties of the post-etch surface, with `roughness` and `crystallinity` properties.

This schema should be adaptable to various ALE processes and can be extended or modified as needed.
