Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process has been refined to include new properties, reorganize existing ones, and enhance descriptions for clarity and accuracy. Here is the updated schema:

This schema now includes new properties such as `ALDMethod`, `MaterialDeposited`, `filmThickness`, `filmConformality`, and reorganized properties under `StructuralProperties`, `ElectricalProperties`, and `OpticalProperties` as suggested by the domain expert. It also removes and refines several properties to better align with the research paper and expert feedback.
