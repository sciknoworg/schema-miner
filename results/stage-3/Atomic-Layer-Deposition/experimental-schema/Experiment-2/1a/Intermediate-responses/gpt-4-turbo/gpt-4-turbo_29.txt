Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process for LiCoO2 thin film electrodes, particularly for all-solid-state Li-ion micro-batteries. The paper provides detailed insights into the use of specific precursors, deposition conditions, and the electrochemical properties of the films, which are crucial for enhancing the schema.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Specific Precursors and Conditions for LiCoO2:**
   - The schema should include the specific precursors used for LiCoO2 (CoCp2 for cobalt and LiOtBu for lithium) and the conditions under which they are used, including their temperatures and the use of O2 plasma as an oxidant.

2. **Deposition Conditions:**
   - The deposition temperature and the growth rate per cycle specific to LiCoO2 should be added. The research paper specifies a deposition temperature of 325°C and a growth rate of 0.06 nm/cycle.

3. **Electrochemical Properties:**
   - The schema should reflect the electrochemical properties discussed in the paper, such as the electrochemical performance and specific capacity measurements.

4. **Film Analysis Techniques:**
   - Include the techniques used for film analysis such as Elastic Backscattering Spectroscopy (EBS) and Raman spectroscopy, which are crucial for determining the composition and phase of the deposited films.

5. **Annealing Conditions:**
   - Details about the annealing process (700°C for 6 minutes) that leads to the high-temperature phase of LiCoO2, which is crucial for achieving electrochemical activity.

6. **Super-cycle Definition:**
   - Define and include the concept of a super-cycle used in the deposition process, which is a combination of cycles for Co3O4 and Li2CO3.
