Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include specific details about the use of novel N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors for copper deposition in plasma-enhanced ALD processes. The paper provides detailed information on the properties of these precursors, their thermal behavior, and the deposition process, which are not currently reflected in the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary updates:

This refined schema now includes the use of NHC precursors for copper deposition, their thermal stability, and the specific conditions under which they are used in plasma-enhanced ALD processes. It also reflects the detailed properties of the deposited copper films, including their crystallinity and impurity content.
