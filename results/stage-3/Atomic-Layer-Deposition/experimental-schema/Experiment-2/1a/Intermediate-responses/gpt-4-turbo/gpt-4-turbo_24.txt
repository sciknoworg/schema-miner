Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process can be refined to include properties related to Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) as a tool for studying, optimizing, and monitoring the plasma-assisted ALD processes. The paper highlights the importance of OES in identifying reactant species and reaction products, which provides insights into the reaction mechanisms of the deposition process.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the insights from the research paper:

This schema now includes a new section under `processParameters` for `opticalEmissionSpectroscopy`, which captures whether OES is enabled and details about the spectra observed during the process. This addition helps in understanding the reaction mechanisms and optimizing the process based on real-time data from OES.
