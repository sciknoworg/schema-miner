Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for 2D materials, particularly focusing on van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, epitaxial relationships, and the specific conditions under which these processes occur.

### Schema Refinements and Additions:

1. **Addition of vdW Epitaxy Details:**
   - The research paper emphasizes the importance of vdW epitaxy in the deposition of 2D materials. This aspect is not explicitly covered in the current schema. We need to add properties related to vdW epitaxy, including epitaxial relationships and orientations.

2. **Substrate Details:**
   - The schema should include more detailed properties of substrates like muscovite mica and sapphire, especially focusing on their role in vdW epitaxy. This includes the specific epitaxial relationships for different materials on these substrates.

3. **Temperature and Vacuum Conditions:**
   - The paper mentions the use of low temperatures and low vacuum conditions. These details should be explicitly included in the `processParameters` to reflect the conditions under which the ALD process operates for 2D materials.

4. **Domain Sizes and Morphology:**
   - Information about domain sizes and morphology, which are crucial for understanding the quality of the deposited films, should be added.

5. **Incorporation of New Materials:**
   - The schema should include the newly mentioned materials like ReS2 and PbI2, along with their specific properties and deposition details.
