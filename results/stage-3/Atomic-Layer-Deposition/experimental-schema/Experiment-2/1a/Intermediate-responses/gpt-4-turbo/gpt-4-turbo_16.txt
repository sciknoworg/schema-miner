Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be updated to include the deposition of TiN and TaN films, which are used as diffusion barriers for Cu and Li. The paper highlights the use of remote plasma ALD with specific precursors and plasma conditions, which are crucial for achieving the desired film properties and functionalities as diffusion barriers.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the new findings and expert recommendations:
