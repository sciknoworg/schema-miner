Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several updates and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process for transition-metal-doped ZnO layers, particularly focusing on magneto-optical properties and ferroelectric behavior as highlighted in the research.

### Schema Updates:

1. **Addition of Dopants and Their Properties:**
   - The schema should include properties specific to dopants such as type, concentration, and effects on the ZnO properties.

2. **Magneto-Optical Properties:**
   - The schema lacks detailed properties related to magneto-optical effects such as the Kerr effect, which are crucial for the materials discussed in the paper.

3. **Ferroelectric Properties:**
   - Given the paper's focus on ferroelectric behavior in Fe-doped ZnO, this should be represented in the schema.

4. **Dielectric Properties:**
   - The schema should include dielectric constant and loss, which are important for understanding the electrical behavior of the films.

5. **Detailed Film Deposition Process:**
   - The schema should include more detailed steps and conditions specific to the deposition of doped ZnO films, such as the use of specific precursors and oxidants, deposition temperature, and cycle details.
