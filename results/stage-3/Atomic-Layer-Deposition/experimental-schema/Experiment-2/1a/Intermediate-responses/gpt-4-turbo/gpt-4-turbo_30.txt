Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include specific details about the deposition of Ga2O3 thin films using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with trimethylgallium (TMG) and oxygen plasma. The paper provides insights into the chemical, structural, and morphological characterizations of the films, which are crucial for enhancing the schema.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Precursor Details:**
   - The precursor "Trimethylgallium (TMG)" and its specific parameters such as dose and temperature need to be added.

2. **Inclusion of Oxidant Details:**
   - Details about the oxidant used, specifically oxygen plasma, including flow duration and power settings.

3. **Update on Deposition Temperature Range and Rate:**
   - The schema should reflect the wide ALD temperature window from 100 to 400°C and the constant deposition rate of 0.53 Å/cycle.

4. **Annealing Process Details:**
   - Information on post-deposition annealing, including temperature and atmosphere (N2), which affects the crystallinity and properties of the film.

5. **Film Properties Enhancement:**
   - Update the film properties to include refractive index, roughness, and crystalline phase post-annealing.

6. **Chemical Composition and Bonding States:**
   - Include details from XPS analysis showing the presence of Ga, O, and C, and adjustments post-ion beam etching.
