Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for 2D materials, particularly focusing on van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, substrate interactions, and the specific conditions and materials mentioned in the paper.

### Schema Refinements and Additions:

1. **Addition of Substrate Details:**
   - The paper discusses the use of specific substrates like muscovite mica and sapphire, which influence the epitaxial growth of 2D materials. This aspect is currently missing from the schema.

2. **Inclusion of Epitaxial Relationships and Domain Orientations:**
   - The paper provides detailed epitaxial relationships and domain orientations for materials like HfS2, MoS2, SnS2, ZrS2, and PbI2. These details are crucial for understanding the growth patterns and should be included.

3. **Temperature and Pressure Conditions:**
   - The schema should explicitly include the range of temperatures and pressures used, as these are critical for the vdW epitaxy process described.

4. **Material Specific Properties:**
   - The schema should include properties specific to the materials deposited, such as phase (e.g., 1T, 2H) and crystallinity, which are important for the properties of the final films.

5. **Domain Size and Morphology:**
   - Information on domain size and morphology, which are mentioned as critical for film quality, should be included.
