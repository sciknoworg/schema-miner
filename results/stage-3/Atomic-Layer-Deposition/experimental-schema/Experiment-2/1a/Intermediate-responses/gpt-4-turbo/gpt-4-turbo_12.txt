Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several updates and additions are necessary to refine the schema to better represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on the deposition of MoS2 and the use of heterostructures for photoelectrochemical applications.

### Updates and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Precursors**:
   - The paper mentions the use of cycloheptatriene molybdenum tricarbonyl (C7H8Mo(CO)3) as a precursor. This should be added to the list of precursors with its properties.

2. **New Properties for MoS2/TiO2 Heterostructures**:
   - The paper discusses the benefits of MoS2/TiO2 heterostructures. This should be represented in the schema under a new property `heterostructures`.

3. **Update on Film Properties**:
   - The paper provides detailed information on the crystallinity improvements and the electronic structure of the MoS2 films. These details should be reflected in the `filmProperties` section.

4. **Inclusion of Photoelectrochemical Performance**:
   - The enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of MoS2/TiO2 heterostructures should be included under a new property `photoelectrochemicalProperties`.

5. **Temperature and Precursor Details**:
   - The ALD temperature window and specific details about the precursor reactions should be updated in the `processParameters`.
