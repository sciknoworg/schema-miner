Changes made:
1. Added new precursor chemicals mentioned in the research paper to the `precursor` property.
2. Added water (H2O) as a co-reactant in the `coReactant` property.
3. Reorganized the schema based on domain expert feedback, ensuring clarity and accuracy in descriptions and property groupings.
