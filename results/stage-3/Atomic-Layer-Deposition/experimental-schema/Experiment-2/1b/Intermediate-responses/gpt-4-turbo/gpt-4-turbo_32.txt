Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include new properties and modify existing ones to better represent the process, particularly focusing on the redeposition effect and gas residence time during plasma-assisted ALD. Here is the refined schema:

This schema now includes the new property `gasResidenceTime` under `DepositionConditions` to account for the redeposition effect described in the research paper. It also reflects the expert's feedback on property grouping and description adequacy.
