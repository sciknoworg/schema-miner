Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to better represent the parameters and processes involved in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) for MoOx layers, particularly for applications in silicon heterojunction solar cells. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary changes:

Changes made:
1. Updated descriptions and property types based on the research paper and expert feedback.
2. Added missing properties and refined existing ones to better capture the specifics of the PE-ALD process for MoOx layers.
3. Ensured that the schema is comprehensive and accurately reflects the ALD process as used in the context of the research paper.
