Based on the provided research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process has been refined to include additional properties and modifications to existing properties. The schema now better reflects the specifics of plasma-assisted ALD processes, particularly for materials like LiPO(N) used in solid state batteries, and addresses expert recommendations on property grouping and description adequacy.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
