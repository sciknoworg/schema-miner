Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for 2D materials, especially focusing on van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, low temperature, and low vacuum conditions. Here's the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
