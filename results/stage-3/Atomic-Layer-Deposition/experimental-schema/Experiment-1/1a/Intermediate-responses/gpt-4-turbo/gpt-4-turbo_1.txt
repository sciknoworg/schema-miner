Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process has been refined. The schema now includes properties relevant to the deposition of 2D materials using van der Waals epitaxy, and adjustments have been made to better organize and clarify existing properties.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now better reflects the complexities and specifics of the ALD process, particularly in the context of 2D materials and van der Waals epitaxy, as highlighted in the research paper. The adjustments and additions based on expert feedback ensure a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the ALD process.
