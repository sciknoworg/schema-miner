Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include details specific to the deposition of copper using plasma-enhanced ALD with novel N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors. The paper provides insights into the thermal behavior, stability, and deposition characteristics of these precursors, which are crucial for accurate schema representation.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Precursor Stability:** Information on the thermal stability and volatility of the precursors used, which is critical for understanding their behavior under ALD conditions.
   - **Precursor Structure:** Details about the molecular structure of the precursors, which influence their reactivity and effectiveness in the ALD process.
   - **Deposition Characteristics:** Information on the growth rate and the nature of the deposited film, which are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of the ALD process.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties:**
   - **MaterialDeposited:** Update to include copper (Cu) alongside Al2O3, as the paper discusses copper deposition.
   - **ProcessParameters -> ReactantSelection -> Precursor:** Update to include details about the specific NHC precursors used for copper deposition.

3. **Enhancements for Clarity and Comprehensiveness:**
   - **Diagnostic Techniques:** Ensure this includes techniques used to analyze the deposited films, such as Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction, as mentioned in the paper.
