Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on the deposition of MoS2 and the use of heterostructures like MoS2/TiO2 for photoelectrochemical applications.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Materials and Heterostructures**:
   - The schema should include MoS2 and TiO2 as materials and detail the heterostructures formed with these materials.

2. **Precursor Details**:
   - The schema should be updated to include specific precursors used for MoS2 deposition, such as cycloheptatriene molybdenum tricarbonyl (C7H8Mo(CO)3).

3. **Process Parameters**:
   - Update the `TemperatureRange` to include the specific range found effective for MoS2 deposition (225-285°C).
   - Include details about the ALD window and growth per cycle (GPC) which are crucial for understanding the deposition efficiency.

4. **Substrate Details**:
   - Include nanostructured substrates like carbon nanotubes and anodized titanium dioxide nanotube arrays, which are used for enhanced photoelectrochemical performance.

5. **Film Properties**:
   - Update to include properties like crystallinity post-deposition and the effects of post-deposition treatments like sulfurization at specific temperatures.

6. **Diagnostic Techniques**:
   - Add specific techniques used in the study such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy which are crucial for analyzing the film quality and composition.

7. **PEC Performance**:
   - Include a new section detailing the photoelectrochemical performance metrics observed with the MoS2/TiO2 heterostructures.
