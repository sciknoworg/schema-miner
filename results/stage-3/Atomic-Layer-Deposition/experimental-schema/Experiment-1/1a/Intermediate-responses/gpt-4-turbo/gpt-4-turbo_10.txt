Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we can refine the schema by incorporating new properties and refining existing ones to better represent the ALD process, especially focusing on the use of novel precursors and their characteristics.

### Refinements and Additions:

1. **Precursor Properties**:
   - The paper discusses novel precursors like tris(diethylamino)aluminum and tris(diisopropylamino)aluminum, which are alternatives to trimethylaluminum. These should be added to the list of precursors.
   - Properties such as volatility and reactivity at the growth surface are crucial. These can be added under each precursor.

2. **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)**:
   - The paper mentions TGA data showing evaporation temperatures and residue percentages. This could be a new property under `ProcessParameters` to help in understanding the thermal stability and decomposition characteristics of the precursors.

3. **ALD Growth Parameters**:
   - Specific growth parameters like precursor purge time, substrate temperature, and growth rate are detailed. These should be explicitly defined in the schema under `ProcessParameters`.

4. **Film Characterization**:
   - The paper discusses the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure film roughness. This should be added to `DiagnosticTechniques` if not already included.

5. **Amorphous Nature of Films**:
   - The films are described as amorphous. This could be a property under `FilmProperties`.
