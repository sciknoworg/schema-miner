Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are proposed for the JSON schema to better represent the ALD process for B-doped ZnO and other materials:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Dopant Source:** The research paper introduces triisopropyl borate (TIB) as a boron precursor for B-doped ZnO. This should be added to the schema under `ReactantSelection` to include boron sources.
   - **Doping Fraction:** The paper discusses the doping fraction (DF) as a critical parameter affecting the properties of the films. This should be added as a property under `ALDGrowthParameters`.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties:**
   - **MaterialDeposited:** Update the description to include B-doped ZnO as a specific example.
   - **ReactantSelection:** Expand the `Precursor` property to include details about safety and vapor pressure, as highlighted for TIB in the paper.
   - **ProcessParameters:** Include a property for `DopantCycleRatio` to represent the ratio of ZnO to dopant ALD cycles, which is crucial for controlling doping levels.

3. **Enhancements Based on Expert Feedback:**
   - **Diagnostic Techniques:** Experts suggest adding specific techniques used for analyzing doped films, such as Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and Proton-Induced Gamma Ray Emission (PIGE), which were used in the paper to analyze film composition.
   - **FilmProperties:** Include properties like `ElectricalConductivity` and `CarrierConcentration` which are critical for assessing the performance of doped films.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
