Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several updates and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for 2D materials, particularly focusing on van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy and the specific conditions and materials mentioned.

### Updates to the Current JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Substrate Information:**
   - The research paper emphasizes the importance of substrate choice in vdW epitaxy. This should be reflected in the schema.

2. **Incorporation of Epitaxial Relationships and Domain Information:**
   - The paper provides detailed information on the epitaxial relationships and domain orientations which are crucial for understanding the growth quality and characteristics of the deposited films.

3. **Temperature and Vacuum Conditions:**
   - Specific temperature ranges and vacuum conditions used in the ALD process for 2D materials should be included to provide a comprehensive view of the process parameters.

4. **Material Specific Properties:**
   - The schema should include properties specific to the materials mentioned like HfS2, MoS2, SnS2, ZrS2, and PbI2, reflecting their unique deposition behaviors and film characteristics.
