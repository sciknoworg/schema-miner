Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to include specific details about the deposition of LiPO(N) materials, which are crucial for solid-state batteries. The paper provides insights into the deposition of lithium phosphate (Li3PO4) and nitrogen-doped lithium phosphates (LiPON), their crystallinity, stoichiometry, and ionic conductivity, which are not currently detailed in the schema.

### Changes Made:
1. **MaterialDeposited**: Added Li3PO4 and LiPON to the list of materials.
2. **Precursors**: Added LiOtBu and TMP as precursors and included N2 as a plasma type.
3. **DiagnosticTechniques**: Ensured that techniques like XPS and XRD are included, which are crucial for analyzing the film properties mentioned in the research paper.

These changes ensure that the schema is more comprehensive and accurately reflects the details necessary for ALD processes involving LiPO(N) materials, as highlighted in the research paper.
