Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the details and findings from the paper. The paper discusses the effectiveness of plasma-assisted ALD for Al2O3 in achieving excellent surface passivation on c-Si substrates, which is crucial for high-efficiency solar cells. It also highlights the importance of post-deposition annealing and the properties of the films, such as thickness and the effects of annealing.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:

This schema now includes a new section under `ProcessParameters` for `Annealing`, which is crucial for achieving the desired film properties as highlighted in the research paper. Additionally, the `FilmProperties` object has been expanded to include `SurfacePassivation`, reflecting the importance of this characteristic in the context of solar cell efficiency.
