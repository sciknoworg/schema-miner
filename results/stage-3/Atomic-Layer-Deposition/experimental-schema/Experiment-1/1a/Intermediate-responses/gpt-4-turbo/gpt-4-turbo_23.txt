Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are proposed for the JSON schema to better represent the ALD process for cobalt using various plasma types:

1. **Addition of Co-reactant Details**:
   - The research paper highlights the importance of co-reactants in the ALD process and their impact on film properties. The schema should include detailed properties of co-reactants used, such as type (H2, N2, NH3, or mixed), and their ratios if mixed.

2. **Enhanced Plasma Conditions**:
   - The paper discusses the role of plasma composition and its effect on film properties. The schema should include properties for plasma composition, specifically the ratios of gases used in mixed plasmas, which influence the deposition outcome.

3. **Film Properties Refinement**:
   - The paper provides insights into the microstructure and purity of the films. These properties should be explicitly included in the schema under `FilmProperties`.

4. **Reaction Products**:
   - The detection of reaction products like HCp during the process as mentioned in the paper should be recorded. This can help in understanding the chemical reactions occurring during the deposition process.

5. **Process Variants**:
   - The paper compares different processes (AB and ABC processes). The schema should allow for the representation of these variants, including sequence and type of plasma exposures.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these suggestions:
