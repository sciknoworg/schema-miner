Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are proposed for the JSON schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Precursor Properties:** The research paper discusses the use of a specific liquid precursor, Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd), for Y2O3 films. This precursor has unique properties such as being liquid at room temperature and enabling a higher growth rate. These details are crucial for replicating the ALD process and should be included in the schema.
   - **Film Hydrophobicity:** The paper details the hydrophobic properties of the Y2O3 films, including changes in water contact angle with film thickness and post-treatment conditions. This is an important characteristic for applications and should be included.
   - **Annealing Effects:** Information on how annealing at 500 °C affects the hydrophobicity of the films is provided. This should be included as it impacts the material properties significantly.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties:**
   - **ProcessParameters:** The schema should include details about the ALD window (150 to 300 °C) and growth rates as these are critical for the process setup.
   - **Diagnostic Techniques:** The use of specific characterization techniques such as XRR, XRD, SEM, AFM, and XPS should be explicitly mentioned as they are crucial for verifying the film properties.

3. **Enhancements for Clarity and Completeness:**
   - **Substrate Details:** The schema should specify that Si(100) substrates with a native oxide layer are used, as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Temperature and Pressure Conditions:** Details about the precursor temperature (120 °C) and delivery line temperature (130 °C) should be included to prevent precursor condensation.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
