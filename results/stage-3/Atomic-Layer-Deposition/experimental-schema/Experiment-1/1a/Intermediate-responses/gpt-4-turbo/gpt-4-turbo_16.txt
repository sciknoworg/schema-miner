Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be updated to include properties specific to the deposition of TiN and TaN films, which are used as diffusion barriers for Cu and Li. The paper highlights the importance of plasma exposure time and the specific precursors used in the deposition process, which influence the material properties and effectiveness of the diffusion barriers.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:
