Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include details about the nitride-mediated epitaxy process, the formation of interlayers during the ALD process, and the specific precursors and plasma conditions used. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these details:

This schema now includes a detailed description of the interlayer formation, which is crucial for understanding the nitride-mediated epitaxy process described in the research paper. It also includes the specific plasma types used with each precursor, which is essential for replicating the conditions necessary for the deposition process.
