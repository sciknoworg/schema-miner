Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for 2D materials, especially focusing on van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, substrate interactions, and the specific conditions used for these processes.

### Schema Refinements and Additions:

1. **Addition of Substrate Details:**
   - The schema should include more detailed properties of substrates such as 'c-plane sapphire' and 'muscovite mica', which are crucial for vdW epitaxy.

2. **Inclusion of Epitaxial Relationships:**
   - The schema should capture the epitaxial relationships and orientations, which are critical for understanding the growth patterns and quality of the 2D materials.

3. **Temperature and Vacuum Conditions:**
   - The schema should explicitly include the range of temperatures and vacuum conditions used, as these are lower than typical ALD processes and crucial for the deposition of 2D materials.

4. **Domain Sizes and Morphology:**
   - Information about domain sizes and film morphology should be included as they are important for assessing the quality of the films.

5. **Precursor Details:**
   - More detailed information about the precursors used, especially those that enable low-temperature growth, should be included.
