Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include properties related to surface passivation, specifically for Al2O3 films used in plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PA-ALD). The paper highlights the effectiveness of Al2O3 in achieving excellent surface passivation on c-Si substrates, which is crucial for high-efficiency solar cells. The schema should reflect these findings to ensure it is comprehensive and accurate for ALD processes involving surface passivation layers.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Surface Passivation Properties:**
   - The schema lacks detailed properties related to surface passivation, which is a critical aspect as highlighted in the paper. We need to add properties that describe the effectiveness of the passivation layer, such as effective surface recombination velocity and the impact of post-deposition annealing.

2. **Enhancement of Film Properties:**
   - Include properties related to the atomic composition and stability of the films, as these are crucial for understanding the quality and effectiveness of the ALD process.

3. **Inclusion of Post-Deposition Processes:**
   - The paper discusses the importance of post-deposition annealing in achieving effective surface passivation. This should be reflected in the schema.
