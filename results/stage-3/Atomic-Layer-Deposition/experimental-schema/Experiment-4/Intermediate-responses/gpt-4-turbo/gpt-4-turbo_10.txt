Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to better represent the ALD process for alumina thin films, particularly focusing on the properties of new precursors and their implications on film properties.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Precursors**:
   - The paper introduces tris(diethylamino)aluminum (Al(DEA)3) and tris(diisopropylamino)aluminum (Al(DIA)3) as alternatives to trimethylaluminum (TMA). These should be added to the schema under `reactantSelection`.

2. **Vapor Pressure and Volatility**:
   - The paper discusses the volatility and vapor pressure of the new precursors. This information is crucial for ALD processes and should be included in the schema.

3. **Film Properties**:
   - The paper mentions the amorphous nature of the films and their roughness. These properties should be explicitly mentioned in the schema.

4. **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)**:
   - TGA data is provided for the new precursors, which is important for understanding their thermal stability and decomposition. This should be included under precursor properties.

5. **ALD Growth Parameters**:
   - Specific ALD growth parameters such as precursor purge time, substrate temperature, and growth rate are detailed. These should be included to provide a more comprehensive view of the deposition conditions.

### Updated JSON Schema:
