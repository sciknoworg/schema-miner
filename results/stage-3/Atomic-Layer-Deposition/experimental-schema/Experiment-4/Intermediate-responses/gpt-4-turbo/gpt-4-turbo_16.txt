Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include specific details about the deposition of TiN and TaN films, particularly their use as diffusion barriers for Cu and Li. The research paper provides insights into the deposition conditions, material properties, and performance of these films as diffusion barriers, which are not currently detailed in the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary updates:
