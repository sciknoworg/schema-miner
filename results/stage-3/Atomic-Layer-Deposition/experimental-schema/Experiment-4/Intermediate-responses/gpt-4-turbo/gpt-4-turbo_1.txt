Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to better represent the complexities and specifics of the ALD process for 2D materials, particularly focusing on van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, substrate interactions, and the deposition of various 2D materials at low temperatures and low vacuum conditions. Here's the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
