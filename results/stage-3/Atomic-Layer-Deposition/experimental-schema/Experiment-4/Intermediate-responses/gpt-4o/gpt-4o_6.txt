Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following updates and refinements are made to the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process:

1. **Epitaxial Growth Details**: The research paper highlights the importance of epitaxial growth, especially for 2D materials. Therefore, a new section for epitaxial growth details is added under `filmProperties`.

2. **Van der Waals Epitaxy**: The paper discusses van der Waals epitaxy, which is crucial for 2D materials. This is added as a property under `epitaxialGrowth`.

3. **Domain Size and Orientation**: The paper provides insights into domain size and orientation, which are important for film quality. These are added under `epitaxialGrowth`.

4. **Substrate Influence**: The influence of different substrates on epitaxial growth is significant. This is reflected in the `substrateDetails` section.

5. **Temperature and Pressure Conditions**: The paper emphasizes low-temperature and low-pressure conditions for certain processes. These are already covered under `processConditions`, but descriptions are refined for clarity.

6. **Material-Specific Properties**: The paper mentions specific materials like HfS2, MoS2, etc., and their epitaxial relationships. While specific materials are not added to the schema, the schema is refined to accommodate such details under `filmProperties`.

7. **General Refinements**: Based on expert feedback, ensure that descriptions are clear and align with standard ALD practices.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
