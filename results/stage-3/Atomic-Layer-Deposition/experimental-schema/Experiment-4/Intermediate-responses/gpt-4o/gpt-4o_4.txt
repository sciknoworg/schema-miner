Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, we will refine the current JSON schema for the ALD process. The paper highlights the importance of surface passivation, particularly for crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates, and the role of plasma-assisted ALD in achieving this. It also discusses the significance of post-deposition annealing and the presence of built-in charges in Al2O3 films. Here are the key updates and additions to the schema:

1. **Surface Passivation**: Add a new property under `filmProperties` to capture details about surface passivation, including effective surface recombination velocity and built-in charge.

2. **Annealing Effects**: Enhance the `annealingConditions` property to include details about the effects of annealing on surface passivation.

3. **Plasma-Assisted ALD**: Ensure that the `plasmaConditions` property captures the role of plasma in surface passivation and film quality.

4. **Substrate Details**: Add properties to capture the type and resistivity of the substrate, as these are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of surface passivation.

5. **Film Composition**: Include properties to capture the atomic composition of the film, such as the presence of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, which are relevant for passivation quality.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
