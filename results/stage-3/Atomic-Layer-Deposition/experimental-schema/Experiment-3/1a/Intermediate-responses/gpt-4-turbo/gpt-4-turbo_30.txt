Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness for representing the ALD process, particularly for plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) of Ga2O3 thin films using trimethylgallium (TMG) and oxygen plasma.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of ALD Temperature Window**:
   - The paper specifies an ALD temperature window from 100 to 400Â°C, which is crucial for understanding the operational limits of the ALD process.

2. **Refinement of Reactants**:
   - The schema should include specific details about the reactants used, especially the Ga precursor and oxidant details which are TMG and O2 plasma, respectively.

3. **Addition of Annealing Details**:
   - Post-deposition annealing details are significant as they affect the properties of the deposited films. The schema should include annealing temperature and atmosphere.

4. **Inclusion of Chemical Composition and Bonding States**:
   - XPS analysis reveals the presence of Ga, O, and C elements. This should be reflected in the schema to provide insights into the chemical composition and bonding states post-deposition.

5. **Surface Morphology and Roughness**:
   - AFM results showing surface morphology and roughness changes due to annealing should be included to provide a complete picture of the film characteristics.

6. **Optical Properties**:
   - The refractive index changes post-annealing are crucial for applications and should be included in the schema.
