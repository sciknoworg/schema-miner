Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy of 2D materials, particularly focusing on low temperature and low vacuum conditions, as well as the specific epitaxial relationships and substrate interactions.

### Schema Refinements and Additions:

1. **Substrate Details**:
   - Add specific properties under `Substrate` to include `Orientation` and `MaterialType` (e.g., mica, sapphire) to capture the substrate's crystal orientation and material which are crucial for vdW epitaxy.

2. **Epitaxial Relationships**:
   - Introduce a new property `EpitaxialRelationship` under `GrowthBehavior` to describe the orientation relationship between the deposited film and the substrate, which is a key factor in vdW epitaxy.

3. **Domain Characteristics**:
   - Under `GrowthBehavior`, add properties to describe `DomainSize` and `OrientationDistribution` to capture details about the size of crystalline domains and their orientation distribution which are important for understanding film quality and uniformity.

4. **Temperature and Vacuum Conditions**:
   - Ensure that `ProcessConditions` includes properties for `TemperatureRange` and `VacuumPressure`, reflecting the specific conditions used in vdW epitaxy which are lower than typical ALD processes.

5. **Film Morphology**:
   - Under `FilmProperties`, add a property `Morphology` to describe how the film grows in relation to the substrate (flat, tilted, etc.), which is influenced by the growth conditions and substrate.
