Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process for LiCoO2 thin films, particularly for applications in all-solid-state Li-ion micro-batteries. The paper provides detailed insights into the use of specific precursors, growth rates, and electrochemical properties, which are crucial for enhancing the schema.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Specific Precursors and Conditions for LiCoO2:**
   - The schema should include specific precursors used for LiCoO2, namely CoCp2 and LiOtBu, and their conditions such as temperature and dosing time.
   - Include the use of O2 plasma as an oxidant source and its specific parameters like power and exposure time.

2. **Growth Rate and Film Thickness:**
   - Include properties for growth rate and film thickness, which are crucial for understanding the deposition efficiency and material properties.

3. **Electrochemical Properties:**
   - Detailed electrochemical properties such as capacity, voltage range, and cycling stability should be added to better represent the functionality of the deposited films.

4. **Material Analysis Techniques:**
   - Include properties for material analysis techniques used, such as Elastic Backscattering Spectroscopy (EBS) and Raman spectroscopy, which are essential for verifying material composition and structure.

5. **Thermal Treatment:**
   - Details about post-deposition annealing, such as temperature and duration, which are critical for achieving the desired crystalline phase and electrochemical activity.

6. **Safety and Stability Enhancements:**
   - Refine the safety and stability section to include specific protocols and stability measures relevant to the materials and processes described, especially considering the handling of lithium compounds.
