Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy:

1. **Addition of Surface Passivation Properties**: The research paper discusses the effectiveness of Al2O3 films in surface passivation of c-Si substrates, which is crucial for solar cell performance. This aspect is not currently covered in the schema.

2. **Inclusion of Post-Deposition Annealing**: The paper highlights the importance of post-deposition annealing in achieving effective surface passivation. This process condition should be included in the schema.

3. **Details on Film Thickness and its Impact**: The paper provides specific details on the thickness of the Al2O3 films and their impact on surface recombination velocity. This detailed information should be reflected in the schema.

4. **Built-in Charge and its Effects**: The paper mentions the presence of a built-in negative charge in Al2O3 and its beneficial effects on surface passivation, particularly for p-type silicon. This property should be included.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
