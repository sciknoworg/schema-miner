Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details about the use of metal alkoxides as precursors, specifically focusing on their dual role as both metal and oxygen sources. The schema also needs to address the expert's feedback regarding the inclusion of methodology and data origin.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
