Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details about the precursors, particularly the use of HfCl4 and water in the deposition of HfO2. The schema should also reflect the importance of water coverage and its impact on precursor adsorption and reaction mechanisms. Additionally, the expert feedback suggests adding a property to distinguish between experimental and simulation data sources.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
