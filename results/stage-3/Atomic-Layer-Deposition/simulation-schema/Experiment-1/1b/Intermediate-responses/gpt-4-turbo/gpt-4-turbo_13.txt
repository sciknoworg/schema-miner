Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined to include additional details and properties that enhance the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the schema. The updates focus on incorporating insights from the research paper regarding the ASALD process, reactor design, and operating conditions, as well as addressing the feedback from domain experts.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
