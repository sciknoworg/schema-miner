Based on the provided research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes additional properties and modifications to better align with the detailed descriptions of the ALD process as described in the research paper. The schema also incorporates the domain expert's feedback regarding property grouping and the addition of missing properties.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
