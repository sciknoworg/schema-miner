Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are made to the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process:

1. **Addition of Reactor Geometry Details**: The research paper emphasizes the impact of reactor geometry on the ALD process, particularly how the reactor's design influences gas flow, temperature fields, and reactant distribution. This is crucial for understanding the uniformity and quality of the film deposition.

2. **Inclusion of Process Conditions**: The paper details specific process conditions such as reactant flow rates and temperatures which are critical for accurate simulation and experimental setup in ALD processes.

3. **Refinement of Simulation Results**: The paper provides insights into the dynamics of reactant distribution and the effects of various reactor design parameters on the ALD process, which can be used to refine the simulation results section of the schema.

4. **Clarification and Expansion of Methodology**: Based on expert feedback, it's clear that a more explicit mention and description of the methodology (experimental or simulation-based) used in the ALD process are necessary.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
