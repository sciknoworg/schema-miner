Based on the provided research paper content and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are made to the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process:

1. **Adding Missing Properties**: The research paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the kinetics and mechanism of film growth, particularly the role of temperature and the presence of chlorine in the films. This suggests the need for properties related to kinetic parameters and chlorine contamination.

2. **Refining Existing Properties**: The paper discusses the formation of less than one monolayer per cycle and the dependency of film growth rate on process temperature, which are not explicitly captured in the current schema. These details can be integrated into the existing properties under `simulationResults`.

3. **Applying Expert Recommendations**: The expert feedback suggests a need for a clearer distinction between experimental and simulation data. This can be addressed by explicitly labeling data sources within the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
