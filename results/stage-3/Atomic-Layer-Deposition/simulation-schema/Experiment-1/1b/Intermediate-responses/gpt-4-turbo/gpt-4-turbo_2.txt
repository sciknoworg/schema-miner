Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details about the reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on the surface intermediates and their concentrations during the ALD cycle. The paper provides a detailed theoretical model and quantitative representation of the ALD reaction cycle for alumina deposition, which should be reflected in the schema. Additionally, the expert feedback suggests adding a property to distinguish between experimental and simulation data sources.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:

This schema now includes properties for the surface intermediates (CH3 and OH) and their concentrations during the ALD cycle, as well as a property to specify the source of the data (experimental or simulation). This should provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the ALD process.
