This schema now includes a new section under `inputParameters` for `plasmaFunctionalization`, detailing the type of plasma used, its duration, and its effects on graphene. This addition is based on the research paper's emphasis on the role of plasma functionalization in improving the quality of metal contacts on graphene. Additionally, the schema has been adjusted to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in describing the ALD process.
