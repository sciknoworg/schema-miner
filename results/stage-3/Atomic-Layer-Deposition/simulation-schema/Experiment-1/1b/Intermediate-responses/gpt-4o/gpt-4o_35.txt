Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, I will refine the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process. The research paper provides insights into the ALD mechanism, particularly focusing on the initial stages of HfO2 deposition on SiO2 surfaces using HfCl4 and H2O as precursors. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the reaction pathways, transition states, and the effects of temperature and cluster size on the ALD process. The domain expert feedback suggests that the schema is well-organized but points out issues with units and descriptions.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

### Key Updates:
1. **Added `ReaxFF` to the `methods` enum**: This was present in the initial schema but missing in the expert-edited version.
2. **Corrected Units**: Changed the unit for `chemisorbedPrecursorDensity` to `molecules/nm^2` as per the expert feedback.
3. **Added `blockingMechanisms` to `selectiveGrowthMechanism`**: This was present in the initial schema but missing in the expert-edited version.
4. **Added `nucleationProcess`**: This was present in the initial schema but missing in the expert-edited version.

These updates ensure the schema is comprehensive and aligns with the insights from the research paper and expert feedback.
