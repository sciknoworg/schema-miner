Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following updates and refinements have been made to the ALD process JSON schema:

1. **Incorporated Spatial ALD (SALD) Parameters**: The research paper highlights the importance of precursor exposure, substrate velocity, and deposition gap in SALD. These parameters have been added to the schema under a new section `saldParameters`.

2. **Updated Growth Rate Section**: The paper discusses the impact of growth rate on film properties. The `growthRate` section has been updated to include `substrateVelocity` and `precursorExposure`, which are critical for SALD.

3. **Added Process Efficiency Metric**: The concept of process efficiency (`processEfficiency`) was introduced in the paper. This metric has been added to the schema to quantify the efficiency of the ALD process.

4. **Refined Film Properties**: The paper discusses the relationship between growth rate and film density. The `filmProperties` section has been updated to reflect this relationship.

5. **Updated Descriptions and Constraints**: Based on the expert feedback, descriptions and constraints for existing properties have been refined for clarity and accuracy.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
