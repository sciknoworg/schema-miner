Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following updates and refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness, particularly focusing on the area-selective deposition using small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) like aniline:

1. **Addition of Small-Molecule Inhibitors (SMIs) Details:**
   - The research paper highlights the use of aniline as an effective SMI in area-selective ALD. This suggests adding a new property to capture details about SMIs used in the process.

2. **Enhancement of Area-Selective Deposition Details:**
   - The paper provides detailed insights into the mechanism of how aniline blocks precursor adsorption on non-growth areas. This can be detailed under the `areaSelectiveDeposition` property.

3. **Inclusion of DFT and RSA Simulation Details:**
   - The paper discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) and random sequential adsorption (RSA) simulations to study the adsorption properties of aniline. Including properties related to computational methods used for studying the ALD process can be beneficial.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
