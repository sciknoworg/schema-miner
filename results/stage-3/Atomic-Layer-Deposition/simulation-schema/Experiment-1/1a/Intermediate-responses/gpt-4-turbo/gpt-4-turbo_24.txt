Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, here are the refinements made to the schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Precursor Delivery Method**: The paper discusses the use of inert gas to carry the precursor into the reactor. This is an important aspect of the ALD process that affects the distribution and reaction of the precursor.
   - **Half-Cycle Duration**: The paper mentions determined durations for precursor and co-reactant pulses. This is crucial for controlling the film thickness and composition.
   - **Growth Modes**: The paper describes different growth modes (Volmer–Weber, Frank–van der Merwe, and Stranski–Krastanov). This information is vital for understanding the film formation mechanism.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties:**
   - **Temperature**: The schema should specify that the temperature can range from room temperature to high temperatures, as ALD has a wide temperature window.
   - **Pressure**: Clarify that the pressure settings are crucial for maintaining the stability of reactants and by-products, and for optimizing the growth rate.

3. **Enhancements for Clarity and Comprehensiveness:**
   - **Reactants and Precursors**: Distinguish between reactants and precursors more clearly, specifying roles in the ALD process.
   - **Surface Reactions**: Expand the description to include potential by-products and their management, as discussed in the paper.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
