Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are made to the JSON schema for the ALD process:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Persistent Ligands**: The research paper highlights the issue of persistent ligands from the zinc pulse, which are not entirely removed even after extended water pulse exposures. This is a critical aspect affecting the quality and properties of the deposited film. Therefore, a new property to track the percentage of persistent ligands after each cycle is added.

2. **Refinement of Existing Properties:**
   - **Reaction Kinetics**: The paper discusses the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which provide insights into the temperature-dependent growth profile and the impact of persistent ligands. The schema's `reactionKinetics` property is refined to include details about the kMC simulations and their outcomes.
   - **Simulation Details**: The `simulationDetails` property is expanded to include specific parameters used in kMC simulations, such as the lattice description and event filtering, which are crucial for accurately modeling the ALD process.

3. **Enhancements Based on Expert Feedback:**
   - **Documentation and Organization**: Experts suggested improving the documentation within the schema. Each property now includes a more detailed description, ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness.
   - **Avoiding Redundancy**: To avoid redundancy, the schema ensures that new properties like persistent ligands are distinct and do not overlap with existing properties.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
