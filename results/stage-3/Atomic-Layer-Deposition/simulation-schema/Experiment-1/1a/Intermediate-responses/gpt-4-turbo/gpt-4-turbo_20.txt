Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) process, particularly focusing on the simulation aspects and the detailed reaction mechanisms described in the paper.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Occupation Probabilities**:
   - The paper discusses the importance of occupation probabilities for precursor products during the Monte Carlo deposition steps. This is a critical aspect for simulating the growth of thin films and their properties.

2. **Enhanced Simulation Details**:
   - The paper details a simulation protocol combining Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods. The schema should include properties that describe these simulation methods in more detail, including parameters like `occupationProbabilities`, `precursorProducts`, and `surfaceReactions`.

3. **Precursor and Surface Reaction Details**:
   - The paper provides a detailed description of the reactions between the precursor and surface groups, which are crucial for understanding the growth mechanism. These details should be reflected in the schema.

4. **Steric and Overlap Restrictions**:
   - The paper mentions steric hindrance and overlap restrictions which are important for the deposition process. These should be included to provide a more comprehensive model of the deposition process.
