Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the process, particularly focusing on the deposition of silicon carbide (SiC) and the thermodynamics involved in selecting precursors. The schema will be restructured to better categorize input parameters and reaction mechanisms, and to include missing properties related to thermodynamic calculations and precursor details.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

### Changes Made:
1. **Restructured Schema**: Divided the schema into more logical sections such as `processDetails`, `precursors`, `coReactants`, `reactionMechanisms`, and `thermodynamicCalculations`.
2. **Added Thermodynamic Calculations**: Included properties for thermodynamic calculations like Gibbs energy, which is crucial for determining the feasibility of precursor combinations for SiC deposition.
3. **Refined Descriptions**: Enhanced descriptions to provide clearer information about each property's role in the ALD process.
4. **Removed Redundant Properties**: Removed unnecessary properties like `TiOBondFormation` under `chemisorption` to avoid overspecialization.

This refined schema should provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the ALD process, particularly for the deposition of SiC, aligning with both the research paper's focus and expert feedback.
