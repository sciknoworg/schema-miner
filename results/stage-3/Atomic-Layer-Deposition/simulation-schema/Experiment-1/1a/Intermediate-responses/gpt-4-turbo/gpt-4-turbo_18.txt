Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy, particularly focusing on the area-selective ALD process using chemoselective inhibitors:

### 1. Adding New Properties:
- **Inhibitor Details**: The paper discusses the use of acetylacetone as a chemoselective inhibitor in an ABC-type ALD cycle. This is a critical aspect of the area-selective ALD process that is not currently reflected in the schema.

- **Cycle Type**: The paper introduces an ABC-type cycle, which is different from the typical ALD cycles. This should be included to differentiate between standard and modified ALD cycles.

- **Substrate Selectivity**: The paper emphasizes the selectivity of the process on different substrates, which is a key feature of the area-selective ALD process.

### 2. Modifying Existing Properties:
- **Process Details**: Enhance the description to include details about the use of inhibitors and the specific cycle type used (ABC-type).

- **Surface Activation**: Update to include information on how inhibitors affect surface activation and the selectivity mechanism.

### 3. Schema Refinement Based on Expert Feedback:
- **Documentation and Organization**: Ensure that the new properties are well-documented and organized within the schema. Use nested objects for clarity.

- **Avoiding Redundancy**: Ensure that the new properties do not overlap with existing ones and that they add value to the schema.
