Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties and refine existing ones to better capture the nuances of plasma functionalization and its impact on graphene, particularly for Pt–graphene contacts. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:

This refined schema includes a new nested object for plasma functionalization, capturing details such as the type of plasma, power, duration, pressure, and induced functional groups. This addition is crucial for understanding the impact of plasma treatments on the ALD process, particularly in the context of Pt–graphene contacts where plasma functionalization plays a significant role in reducing contact resistance and enhancing precursor adsorption.
