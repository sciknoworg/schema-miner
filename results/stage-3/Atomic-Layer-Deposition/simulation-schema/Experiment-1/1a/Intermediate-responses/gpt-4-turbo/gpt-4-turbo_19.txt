Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the details of area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes, particularly focusing on the nuances of deposition temperature effects, the use of electron beam-induced deposition (EBID) for area activation, and the specific reactants involved in the ZnO deposition.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Specific Reactants and Coreactants for ZnO Deposition:**
   - The schema should explicitly mention diethylzinc (DEZ) and H2O as reactants for ZnO deposition, as these are critical for understanding the specific chemistry involved.

2. **Inclusion of EBID Technique Details:**
   - Since EBID is used for area activation, details about this technique, including the use of SiO2 as a seed layer and the parameters of the electron beam, should be included.

3. **Temperature-Dependent Selectivity:**
   - The schema should capture the effect of deposition temperature on selectivity, which is a crucial aspect of the process as described in the paper.

4. **Enhanced Details on Measurement Techniques:**
   - The schema should include specific measurement techniques used in the study, such as in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and scanning electron microscopy, which are essential for studying the selectivity and effectiveness of the ALD process.

5. **DFT Calculations and Kinetic Details:**
   - Details about density functional theory (DFT) calculations that help understand surface reactions at an atomic level should be included to provide a deeper insight into the process mechanisms.
