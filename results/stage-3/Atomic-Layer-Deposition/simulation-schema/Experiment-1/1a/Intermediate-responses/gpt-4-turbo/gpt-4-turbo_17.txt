Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include details specific to area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) and the use of μ-plasma printing technology for surface activation. The paper provides insights into the process of direct-write ALD using a μ-plasma printer, which is crucial for patterning at microscale levels. This involves local activation of surfaces and selective deposition, which are not currently detailed in the schema.

### Proposed Schema Modifications:

1. **Add New Properties for Area-Selective ALD:**
   - Introduce properties under `processDetails` to describe the area-selective techniques and the tools used, such as the μ-plasma printer.
   - Include properties to describe the activation and deactivation of surface areas, which are critical for AS-ALD.

2. **Enhance `reactants` and `precursors` Details:**
   - Specify the reactants and precursors used in the AS-ALD process, such as Indium cyclopentadienyl (InCp) and the coreactants (H2O and O2).

3. **Detail the Substrate Preparation:**
   - Include properties describing the substrate preparation methods like dipping in hydrofluoric acid (HF) and the types of substrates used (e.g., a-Si:H, a-SiNx:H).

4. **Update `simulationDetails` for Specificity in Modeling:**
   - Add properties to describe the modeling of selective deposition processes, possibly influenced by the μ-plasma printing technology.

5. **Document Measurement Techniques:**
   - Include properties under a new section `measurementTechniques` to detail techniques like XPS and spectroscopic ellipsometry used for validation of the deposition process.
