Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include detailed reaction pathways, steric effects, and cooperative effects as described in the paper. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:

This schema now includes properties for steric effects and cooperative effects within the reaction kinetics, which are crucial for accurately modeling the ALD process as described in the research paper. Additionally, the schema maintains a general structure that can be applied across various ALD systems, adhering to the principles of avoiding redundancy and overspecialization.
