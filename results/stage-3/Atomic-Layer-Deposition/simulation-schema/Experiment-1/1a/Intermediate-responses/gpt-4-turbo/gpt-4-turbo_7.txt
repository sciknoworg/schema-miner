Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed simulation and reactor-specific properties. The research paper emphasizes the importance of modeling self-limited processes and the impact of reactor geometry and flow dynamics on the ALD process. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:
