Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on proton diffusion, densification, and the role of under-coordinated surface atoms. Here's the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
