Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include properties related to plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD), nitrogen doping, and specific reactants used in the process. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:

### Changes Made:
1. **Method Property**: Added "PEALD" as an example method to reflect the use of plasma-enhanced ALD.
2. **Reactants Property**: Introduced a new property under `processDetails` to list reactants like O2 and N2O, which are crucial for understanding the specific chemistry involved in the ALD process, especially for nitrogen doping as mentioned in the research paper.

These changes ensure that the schema is more comprehensive and accurately reflects the details and variants of the ALD process as described in the research paper and expert feedback.
