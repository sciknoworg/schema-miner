Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties and refine existing ones to better represent the spatial ALD process, particularly focusing on the effects of gap size, temperature, and pumping pressure on fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics.

### Changes Made:
1. **Added "gapSize" property**: This new property under "processDetails" captures the critical parameter of gap size which affects fluid dynamics and precursor intermixing, as highlighted in the research paper.
2. **Refined descriptions**: Enhanced clarity and detail in descriptions to better align with the insights from the research paper and expert feedback, emphasizing the impact of temperature, pressure, and methodological specifics on the ALD process.
