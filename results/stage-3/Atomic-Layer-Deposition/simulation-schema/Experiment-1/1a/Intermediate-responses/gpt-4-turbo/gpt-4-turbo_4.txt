Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, here are the refinements made to the schema:

1. **Adding New Properties for Simulation Methodologies**:
   - The research paper emphasizes the importance of simulation methodologies like Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) in understanding and predicting the ALD process. These methodologies are crucial for computational modeling of the ALD process, predicting surface interactions, and material properties at the atomic level.

2. **Refining Existing Properties**:
   - The schema previously did not explicitly include properties related to computational modeling and simulation, which are essential for modern ALD processes as highlighted in the research paper.

3. **Applying Expert Recommendations**:
   - The expert feedback suggested incorporating more detailed computational and simulation aspects into the schema. This aligns with the insights from the research paper, which detailed the use of DFT and MD in ALD processes.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

This schema now includes a new section `simulationDetails` that captures whether DFT and MD are used, aligning with the insights from the research paper and expert feedback. This addition helps in understanding the computational aspect of the ALD process, which is crucial for predicting and optimizing the deposition outcomes.
