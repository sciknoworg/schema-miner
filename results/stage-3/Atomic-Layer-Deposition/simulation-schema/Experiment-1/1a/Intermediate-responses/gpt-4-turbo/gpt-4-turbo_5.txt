### Changes Made:
1. **Added `purgeTime` and `cycleTime`** to `processDetails` to capture the dynamics of the ALD cycle as discussed in the paper.
2. **Added `pulsingTime`** to `precursors` to specify the duration of precursor injection, which is critical for understanding the deposition dynamics.
3. **Enhanced `simulationDetails`** with a nested object `reactionKinetics` that includes details about surface reactions and their rate constants, reflecting the importance of chemical kinetics in the ALD process as highlighted in the research.

These refinements aim to make the schema more comprehensive and aligned with the detailed insights provided by the research paper on alumina ALD.
