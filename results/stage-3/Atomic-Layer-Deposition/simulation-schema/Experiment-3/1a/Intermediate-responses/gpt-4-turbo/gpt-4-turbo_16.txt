Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include specific details about the use of plasma reactants, particularly N2O, and its effects on the properties of IGZO TFTs. The paper highlights the impact of selective application of N2O plasma reactant during the PEALD process and its influence on the electrical characteristics and stability of the devices. Here's the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:

This schema now includes a new section under `processDetails` for `plasmaReactants`, specifically detailing the use of N2O and its effects, which is critical based on the insights from the research paper. This addition ensures the schema is more comprehensive and accurately reflects the complexities and nuances of the ALD process as used in high-performance IGZO TFTs.
