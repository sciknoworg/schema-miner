Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, the following refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy:

1. **Addition of Spatial Reactor Properties**:
   - The research paper discusses the importance of reactor design in spatial ALD processes. Properties such as `inletGeometry`, `outletGeometry`, and `separatorType` (e.g., inert gas curtain, vacuum zones) should be added under `reactorGeometry` to capture these details.

2. **Enhancement of Reaction Zone Details**:
   - The paper highlights the significance of reaction zone configurations. Adding properties like `reactionZoneShape` and `reactionZoneDistribution` can provide more specific details about the spatial arrangement within the reactor.

3. **Inclusion of Rotation Speed**:
   - The paper mentions the impact of rotational speed on reagent exposure and uniformity. A property `rotationSpeed` with units in radians per second (rad/s) should be added under `reactionConditions`.

4. **Detailed Modeling Parameters**:
   - The paper uses multiscale modeling combining atomistic-mesoscopic and macroscopic models. Properties such as `modelingApproach` (e.g., multiscale, CFD, kMC) and `simulationSoftware` (e.g., ANSYS Fluent, Quantum ESPRESSO) should be included to document the computational tools and approaches used.

5. **Refinement of Material and Chemical Properties**:
   - The paper calculates specific thermophysical properties using DFT. Properties like `enthalpyOfFormation`, `entropyOfFormation`, and `specificHeat` should be added under each precursor and byproduct to capture these computed values.

6. **Enhancement of Process Efficiency Metrics**:
   - The paper discusses the optimization of reactor design and operating conditions. Adding properties like `optimalRotationSpeed`, `optimalReagentMoleFraction`, and `processTime` under `processEfficiency` can provide insights into the optimized parameters for achieving high efficiency.
