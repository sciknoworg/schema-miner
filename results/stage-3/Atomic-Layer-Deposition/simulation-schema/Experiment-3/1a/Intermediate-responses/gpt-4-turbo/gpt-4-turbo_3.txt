Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the spatial atomic layer deposition (SALD) process, particularly focusing on the dynamics of precursor exposure, substrate velocity, and their effects on film properties.

### Refinements to the Current Schema:

1. **Substrate Velocity**:
   - The schema should include a more detailed representation of substrate velocity and its impact on precursor exposure and film properties.
   - Add properties under `reactionConditions` to include `substrateVelocity` and its effects on precursor exposure.

2. **Precursor Exposure**:
   - The schema should explicitly model the relationship between precursor exposure and process efficiency, as detailed in the paper.
   - Add properties to `precursors` to include `exposureTime` and `concentration`, which are critical for understanding the saturation state and efficient precursor usage.

3. **Film Properties**:
   - The schema should include more detailed properties of the film, such as density and nanostructure, which are influenced by the growth rate and precursor exposure.
   - Enhance `observableProperties` to include `filmDensity` and `nanostructure`.

4. **Process Efficiency**:
   - Introduce a new property to quantify process efficiency as a function of growth rate, precursor consumption, and deposition time.
   - This could be nested under a new object `processEfficiency` within the main schema.
