Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional details about the chemical reactions, particularly focusing on the dynamics of proton diffusion, densification, and the role of under-coordinated atoms. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
