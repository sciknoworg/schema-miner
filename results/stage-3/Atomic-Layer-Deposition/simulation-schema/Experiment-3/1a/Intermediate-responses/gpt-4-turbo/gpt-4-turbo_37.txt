Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness in representing the ALD process, particularly focusing on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation aspects and the specific details of the ALD setup and conditions described in the paper.

### Refinements to the Current JSON Schema:

1. **CFD Analysis Enhancements**:
   - Add properties to capture the transient conditions during the ALD process as described in the paper.
   - Include properties for the reactant feeding system, which is crucial for understanding the inlet flow rates and the impact of reactor geometry on the process.

2. **Process Conditions**:
   - Include more detailed properties related to the specific setup of the ALD reactor such as the number of inlets and their specific roles (top inlet, side inlet, and loading door inlet).
   - Add properties to describe the specific temperature settings for different parts of the reactor and the substrate, as these have significant impacts on the deposition process.

3. **Temperature and Pressure Fields**:
   - Enhance the schema to include properties that can describe the temperature and pressure distributions within the reactor, which are critical for understanding the uniformity and efficiency of the ALD film deposition.

4. **Reactant Details**:
   - Refine the precursor details to include specific conditions like vapor pressures at given temperatures, which influence the flow rates and the overall deposition process.

### Summary of Changes:
- Enhanced the `CFDAnalysis` object to include properties for transient conditions and detailed inlet configurations.
- Added `vaporPressure` properties under `precursorDetails` to capture specific conditions influencing the precursor flow rates.
- Refined descriptions and added new properties to better align with the detailed process conditions and setups described in the research paper.

These updates aim to make the schema more robust and reflective of the complexities involved in the ALD process as described in the research paper.
