Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness, particularly in capturing the dynamics of small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) in area-selective atomic layer deposition (ASD).

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Small-Molecule Inhibitors (SMIs) Details:**
   - The research paper discusses the use of aniline as a small-molecule inhibitor. This aspect is crucial for ASD and should be reflected in the schema.

2. **Enhanced Details on Precursor Blocking:**
   - The paper provides detailed insights into how aniline blocks the precursor adsorption on non-growth areas. This should be included to provide a more comprehensive view of the reaction mechanisms.

3. **Inclusion of Simulation and Computational Methods:**
   - The paper uses DFT and RSA simulations to study the adsorption configurations and stability of aniline molecules. Including properties related to computational methods will be beneficial for users relying on simulations.

4. **Adsorption Configurations:**
   - The paper identifies multiple adsorption configurations for aniline on different surfaces. This should be detailed in the schema under the reaction mechanism or a new section for adsorption specifics.

5. **Hydrogenolysis Process:**
   - The paper discusses the hydrogenolysis of aniline on metal surfaces, which is a critical reaction affecting the stability and effectiveness of the inhibition layer. This should be included in the schema.
