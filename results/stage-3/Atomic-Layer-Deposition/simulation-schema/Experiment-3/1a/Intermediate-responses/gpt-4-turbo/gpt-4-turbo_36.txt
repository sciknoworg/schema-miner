Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to better represent the details of the ALD process, particularly focusing on the correlation between the growth-per-cycle (GPC) and the surface hydroxyl group concentration, as well as the reaction mechanisms involving trimethylaluminum and water.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Growth-Per-Cycle (GPC) Property:**
   - The research paper emphasizes the importance of GPC and its correlation with surface OH group concentration. This property is crucial for understanding the efficiency of the ALD process.

2. **Refinement of Reaction Mechanism:**
   - The paper provides detailed insights into the reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of surface OH groups and the reaction of trimethylaluminum with water. This needs to be more accurately reflected in the schema.

3. **Inclusion of Surface OH Group Concentration:**
   - Since the surface OH group concentration is a critical factor affecting the GPC, it should be explicitly included in the schema.

4. **Adjustments Based on Temperature and Surface Treatment:**
   - The paper discusses how reaction temperature and substrate heat-treatment temperature affect the ALD process. These factors should be more explicitly detailed in the schema.
