Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process can be refined to better represent the complexities and nuances of the process, especially focusing on reactor scale simulations, self-limited processes, and the impact of non-ideal behaviors.

### Key Changes:
1. **Reactor Geometry and Scale**: Added properties to describe the reactor's geometry and scale, which are crucial for understanding the context of the simulation or experimental setup.
2. **Enhanced Reaction Mechanism Details**: Included more detailed properties under reaction mechanisms to capture complex behaviors and outcomes from computational models.
3. **Process Details**: Expanded to include more specific details about the methodology and source of data, which is essential for replicating or understanding the context of the process.

These refinements aim to make the schema more comprehensive and aligned with the complexities discussed in the research paper and feedback from domain experts.
