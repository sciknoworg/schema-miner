Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following updates and refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy:

1. **Addition of Area-Selective ALD (AS-ALD) Properties:**
   The research paper introduces the concept of area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD), which is not explicitly covered in the current schema. This can be added under a new property `areaSelectiveALD` within `processDetails`.

2. **Inclusion of Micro-Plasma Printing:**
   The paper discusses the use of a micro-plasma printer for local area activation, which is a critical component of the AS-ALD process. This should be included as a new property under `processDetails`.

3. **Update to Reactor Details:**
   The paper mentions the use of an Oxford Instruments Opal ALD reactor. This specific detail can be added to enhance the `reactorGeometry` property.

4. **Enhancement of Precursor Details:**
   The paper specifies the use of Indium cyclopentadienyl (InCp) as a precursor. This detail can be added to the `reactionMechanism` to specify the precursor used in the process.

5. **Addition of Substrate Details:**
   Details about the substrates used, such as a-Si:H and a-SiNx:H, should be included under a new property `substrateDetails`.

6. **Inclusion of Activation and Deposition Process:**
   The sequence of local plasma activation followed by ALD cycles is crucial for understanding the process. This should be detailed under `processDetails`.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
