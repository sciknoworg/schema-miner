Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process has been refined to include new properties and modifications that align with the insights provided. The schema now includes properties related to the use of nitrous oxide plasma reactants and nitrogen doping, which are crucial for understanding the high mobility and reliability of ALD-based IGZO TFTs. Additionally, unnecessary properties like substrate velocity have been removed as per expert advice.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
