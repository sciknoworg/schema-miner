Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include more specific details about the methodology and the source of information (experiment vs simulation). Additionally, the property "substrateVelocity" is deemed not useful and should be removed. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

This schema now includes a more detailed description of the methodologies used in the ALD process, specifies the types of methodologies (computational or experimental), and removes the unnecessary "substrateVelocity" property.
