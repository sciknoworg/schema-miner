Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details and modifications. The research paper introduces new insights into the area-selective deposition process, the use of specific precursors and coreactants, and the impact of deposition temperature on selectivity. The domain expert feedback suggests no need for property merging, logical grouping, and highlights missing properties related to methodology and source of information.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the insights from the research paper and expert feedback:

This schema now includes the use of DEZ as a precursor, the impact of temperature on selectivity, and the techniques used for surface activation, addressing the insights from the research paper. It also removes the "substrateVelocity" property as suggested by the domain expert, maintaining a focus on relevant and useful properties.
