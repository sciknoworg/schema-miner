Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes additional properties and modifications to ensure it aligns with the latest scientific insights and expert recommendations.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

Changes made:
1. Removed the "substrateVelocity" property based on expert feedback that it isn't a useful property.
2. Added detailed descriptions for each property to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness.
3. Ensured that the schema is well-documented and organized, aligning with the latest scientific insights and expert recommendations.
