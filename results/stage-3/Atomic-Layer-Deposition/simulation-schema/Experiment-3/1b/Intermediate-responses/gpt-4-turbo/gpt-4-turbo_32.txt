Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are made to the JSON schema for the ALD process:

1. **Addition of New Properties**: The research paper emphasizes the importance of detailed reaction mechanisms and the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in conjunction with quantum chemistry calculations. This suggests adding properties related to computational methods and detailed reaction mechanisms.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties**: The expert feedback suggests that substrate velocity isn't a useful property, so it will be removed. Additionally, the descriptions of some properties will be enhanced for clarity and completeness.

3. **Validation and Refinement**: Ensure that the properties align with the insights from the research paper, particularly the emphasis on detailed reaction mechanisms and computational methods.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
