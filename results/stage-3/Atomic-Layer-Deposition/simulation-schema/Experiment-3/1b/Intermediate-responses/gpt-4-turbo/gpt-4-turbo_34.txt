Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include details on densification mechanisms, methodology source (experimental vs. simulation), and remove the unnecessary property of substrate velocity. Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes a new property under `reactionMechanisms` for `densificationMechanisms`, which is crucial based on the research paper content. It also clarifies the source of methodology under `methodologyUsed` and removes the `substrateVelocity` property as suggested by the domain expert.
