Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process has been refined to include additional details on the methodology used, source of information, and to remove the unnecessary property of substrate velocity. Here is the updated schema:

This schema now includes a more detailed description of the methodology used in the simulation parameters, specifies the source of information (experimental vs simulation), and removes the substrate velocity property as suggested by the domain expert.
