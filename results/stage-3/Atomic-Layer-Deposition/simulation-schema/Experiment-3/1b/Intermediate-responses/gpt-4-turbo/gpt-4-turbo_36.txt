Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details about the surface chemistry, particularly focusing on the correlation between the growth-per-cycle (GPC) and the surface OH group concentration. The schema also needs to incorporate the methodology used for determining these properties and clarify the source of information (experimental vs. simulation). Additionally, the property "substrateVelocity" is deemed not useful and should be removed.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes the correlation between GPC and surface OH group concentration, clarifies the methodology used, and removes the unnecessary "substrateVelocity" property.
