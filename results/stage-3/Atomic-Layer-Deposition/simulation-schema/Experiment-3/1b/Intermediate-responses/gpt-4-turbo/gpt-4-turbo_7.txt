Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the following refinements are made to the JSON schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties**: The research paper introduces the concept of reactor geometry and the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. These aspects are crucial for modeling the ALD process more accurately. Therefore, properties related to reactor geometry and simulation details are added.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties**: The domain expert suggested that substrate velocity isn't a useful property. This will be removed, and instead, more focus will be given to properties that describe the reactor's operational parameters and simulation methodologies.

3. **Clarification and Enhancement of Descriptions**: Enhancements in descriptions are made to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness, especially around the methodologies used and the simulation parameters.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:
