Based on the provided research paper content, domain expert feedback, and the current JSON schema, I have refined the schema to incorporate new insights and address the feedback. The modifications include:

1. **Adding New Properties**: Based on the research paper, properties related to the small molecule inhibitor (SMI) and its interactions with the ALD process have been added.
2. **Validating Existing Properties**: Ensured that existing properties align with the new insights from the research paper.
3. **Applying Expert Recommendations**: Adjusted descriptions and data types as recommended by the domain expert to ensure the schema aligns with established ALD standards and practices.
4. **Avoiding Redundancy**: Ensured that the schema does not include unnecessary new properties if they overlap with existing ones or compromise the schema’s generality.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
