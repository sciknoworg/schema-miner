Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include details about the use of small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for area-selective deposition, as well as the specific methodologies used for simulation and experimental validation. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
