Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes more detailed descriptions and properties that align with the insights from the research paper and expert recommendations. Here is the refined JSON schema:

Changes made:
1. Updated the "materials" property to include all materials mentioned in the research paper.
2. Enhanced the "methodologyUsed" description to specify types of methodologies.
3. Removed "substrateVelocity" based on expert feedback about its irrelevance.
4. General improvements in descriptions for clarity and completeness based on the research paper insights.
