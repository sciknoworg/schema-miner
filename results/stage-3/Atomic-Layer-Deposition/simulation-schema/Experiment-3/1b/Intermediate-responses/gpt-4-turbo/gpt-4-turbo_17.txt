Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include details about the area-selective deposition techniques, the use of μ-plasma printers for surface activation, and the specific materials and conditions used in the process. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:

This schema now includes a new section for "areaSelectiveDeposition" to capture specific details about the novel method used in the research paper, including the activation method, selectivity, and pattern resolution. Additionally, the materials list and methodology used have been updated to reflect the specifics mentioned in the paper.
