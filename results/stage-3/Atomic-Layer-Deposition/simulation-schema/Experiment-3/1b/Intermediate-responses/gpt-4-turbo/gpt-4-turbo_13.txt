Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details on the methodology and source of information (experiment vs simulation). Additionally, the property "substrateVelocity" is deemed not useful and should be removed. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

This schema now includes a new property "source" under "inputParameters" to specify whether the methodology is based on experimental data or simulations, addressing the expert's feedback on missing details about the source of information. The property "substrateVelocity" has been removed as suggested.
