Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed properties related to the reactor design and simulation parameters, particularly focusing on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) aspects and the specific conditions used in the simulations. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

Changes made:
1. Removed the "substrateVelocity" property as suggested by the domain expert since it was not useful.
2. Added more detailed descriptions to the "methodologyUsed" property to clarify whether the data is from experimental measurements or simulations, addressing the expert's feedback on missing details.
3. Ensured that all properties are well-documented and relevant to the ALD process as described in the research paper and expert feedback.
