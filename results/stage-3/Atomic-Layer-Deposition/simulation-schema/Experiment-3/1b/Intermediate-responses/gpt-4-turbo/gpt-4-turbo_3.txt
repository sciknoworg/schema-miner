Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional properties and modify existing ones to better represent the Spatial ALD (SALD) process, particularly focusing on precursor exposure, substrate velocity, and the impact of these factors on film properties and process efficiency.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the insights from the research paper and expert feedback:

This refined schema includes the addition of the `substrateVelocity` property under `reactorDesign` to account for its critical role in SALD processes as described in the research paper. It also maintains the comprehensive structure needed to describe various aspects of the ALD process, ensuring the schema is both accurate and applicable to different ALD setups.
