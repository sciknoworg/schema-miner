Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details on the methodology and source of information (experiment vs simulation). Additionally, the property "substrateVelocity" is deemed not useful and should be removed. Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes a property to specify whether the methodology is derived from experimental measurements or computational simulations, and the unnecessary property "substrateVelocity" has been removed.
