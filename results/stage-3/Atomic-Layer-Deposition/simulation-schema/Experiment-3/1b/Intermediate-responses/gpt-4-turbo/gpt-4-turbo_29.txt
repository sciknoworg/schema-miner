Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include the specific details of the Zinc Oxide (ZnO) deposition process using diethylzinc (DEZ) and water (H2O). The schema should also reflect the insights from the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) study and the first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo model.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary updates:

This schema now includes specific details about the materials and methodologies used in the ZnO ALD process, as well as the reaction mechanisms and observable properties relevant to the process as described in the research paper. The schema also reflects the domain expert's feedback by removing the "substrateVelocity" property, which was deemed not useful.
