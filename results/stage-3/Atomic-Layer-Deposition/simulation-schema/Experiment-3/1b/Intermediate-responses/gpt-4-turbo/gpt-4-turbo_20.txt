Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed simulation parameters, particularly focusing on the plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process, occupation probabilities for precursor products, and the effects of plasma energy. Additionally, the schema should reflect the use of real, atomistic models of the precursor and the impact of various process parameters in a simplified manner.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
