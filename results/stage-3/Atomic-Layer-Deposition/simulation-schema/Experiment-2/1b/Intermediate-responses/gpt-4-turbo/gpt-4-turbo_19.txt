Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes additional properties and adjustments to existing properties to better reflect the details and findings from the research paper, as well as to address the feedback provided by domain experts.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
