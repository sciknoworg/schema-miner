Changes made:
1. Reorganized the `materials` property to include both `substrateMaterials` and `precursorMaterials` under a single property for better grouping.
2. Added `modelingTechniques` to `simulationParameters` to address the expert's feedback on detailing simulation methods.
3. Maintained the structure of other properties while ensuring descriptions are clear and aligned with the domain knowledge from the research paper and expert feedback.
