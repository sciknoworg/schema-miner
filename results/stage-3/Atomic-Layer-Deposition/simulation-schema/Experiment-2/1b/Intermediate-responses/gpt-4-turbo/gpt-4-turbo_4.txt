Based on the domain expert feedback and the research paper content, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes more detailed descriptions and properties, particularly focusing on simulation methodologies and the sources of information. The schema has been reorganized to better group related properties and to address the feedback regarding property merging and missing properties.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
