Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include more detailed properties related to the surface chemistry, particularly the role of surface OH groups and their concentration in relation to the growth-per-cycle (GPC). Additionally, the schema should reflect the complex reaction mechanisms and the influence of temperature on these processes.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:

This refined schema now includes a new property `surfaceOHGroupConcentration` under `simulationParameters` to capture the critical role of surface OH groups in the ALD process, as highlighted in the research paper. This addition, along with the detailed descriptions, should enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness in representing the ALD process.
