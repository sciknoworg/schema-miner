Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process has been refined to include additional properties and reorganize existing ones for better clarity and accuracy. The schema now includes a new property for the ABC-type cycle and chemoselective inhibitors, which are crucial for understanding the area-selective deposition process described in the paper. Additionally, properties have been grouped and descriptions enhanced as per expert recommendations.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
