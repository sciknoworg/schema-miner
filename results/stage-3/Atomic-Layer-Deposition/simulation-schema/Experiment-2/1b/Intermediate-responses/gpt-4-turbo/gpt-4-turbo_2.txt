Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include more detailed properties related to the reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on the surface intermediates and their concentrations during the ALD process. Additionally, the schema should better organize the properties related to precursors and methodologies used, as suggested by the expert feedback.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

This schema now includes a new property `surfaceIntermediates` under `simulationParameters` to capture the surface coverage of CH3 and H, which are critical for understanding the reaction dynamics as described in the research paper. Additionally, the schema has been reorganized to better align with expert feedback, ensuring that the properties related to precursors are grouped appropriately under `materials`.
