Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to better represent the fluid dynamical aspects and simulation parameters, as well as to address the feedback on property grouping and missing properties. Here is the refined JSON schema:

Changes made:
1. Added more detailed descriptions to the `methodologyUsed` property to include specific computational methods such as DFT (Density Functional Theory) and MD (Molecular Dynamics), as suggested by the research paper.
2. Addressed the expert feedback by ensuring that the methodology is correctly listed and not duplicated under different properties.
3. Ensured that the schema remains comprehensive and avoids redundancy, as per the instructions.
