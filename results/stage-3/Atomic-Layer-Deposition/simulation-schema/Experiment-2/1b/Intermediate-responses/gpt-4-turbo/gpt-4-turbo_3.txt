Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional properties and reorganize existing ones for better clarity and accuracy. Here is the refined JSON schema:

Changes made:
1. Added "surfaceIntermediates" under "simulationParameters" to include details about surface coverage of specific intermediates, as suggested by the research paper.
2. Reorganized the schema to ensure clarity and logical grouping of related properties.
3. Ensured that all descriptions are clear and informative, addressing the expert's concern about the adequacy of descriptions.
