Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process can be refined to better represent the complexities and nuances of the ALD process as discussed in the research paper. The paper highlights the importance of considering non-ideal self-limited processes, reactor geometry, and the impact of competitive adsorption by reaction by-products. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:
