Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process of Zinc Oxide using small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) like trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) has been refined. The schema now includes properties related to the blocking layer formation, the interaction of SMIs with the substrate, and the degradation reactions that might occur during the ALD process. Here is the refined JSON schema:
