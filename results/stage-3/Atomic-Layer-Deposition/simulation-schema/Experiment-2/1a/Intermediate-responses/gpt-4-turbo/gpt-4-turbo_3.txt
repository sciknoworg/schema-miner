Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy, particularly focusing on the aspects of Spatial ALD (SALD) and the impact of precursor exposure on process efficiency and film properties:

1. **Addition of SALD-Specific Properties**:
   - **Precursor Exposure**: The research paper emphasizes the importance of controlling precursor exposure in SALD. This includes the exposure time and the concentration of the precursor in the carrier gas, which are critical for optimizing the growth rate and film properties.
   - **Substrate Velocity**: The paper discusses the impact of substrate velocity on the growth rate and film properties, which is a unique aspect of SALD not covered in the current schema.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties**:
   - **Process Conditions**: Enhance the `processConditions` object to include properties specific to SALD, such as `substrateVelocity` and `precursorExposure`.
   - **Growth Per Cycle (GPC)**: The paper provides detailed insights into how GPC is affected by various parameters like substrate velocity and precursor concentration. This should be reflected in the schema with more detailed descriptions or sub-properties.

3. **Enhanced Descriptions and Constraints**:
   - **Temperature and Pressure**: The paper mentions that SALD can be performed at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures. The schema should specify that these conditions are particularly relevant for SALD.
   - **Reactor Type**: Include details about the possibility of open-air reactors in SALD, which is different from conventional vacuum-based ALD systems.

4. **New Nested Objects for SALD**:
   - **SALD Specifics**: A new nested object to encapsulate all unique SALD parameters such as `substrateVelocity`, `precursorExposure`, and `injectionHeadGap`.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the above suggestions:
