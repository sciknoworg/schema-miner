Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include properties related to the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) plasma reactants and their effects on the electrical characteristics of IGZO TFTs. The paper highlights the importance of selective application of N2O plasma reactants during the plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process and its impact on device performance and stability.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary updates:

This schema now includes the use of N2O as a plasma reactant and its mole fraction, which is crucial for understanding its selective application during the ALD process as described in the research paper. This addition will help in accurately modeling the ALD process for high-performance IGZO TFTs.
