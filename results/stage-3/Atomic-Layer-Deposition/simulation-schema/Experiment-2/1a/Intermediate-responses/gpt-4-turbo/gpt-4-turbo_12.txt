Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, here are the refinements made to the schema:

1. **Addition of Group Contribution Method (GCM) Properties**:
   The research paper introduces the concept of using GCM for designing novel ALD precursors. This method involves computing interaction parameters for functional groups of ALD precursors, which is crucial for predicting the properties of novel materials. Therefore, properties related to GCM should be added to the schema.

2. **Inclusion of Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD)**:
   The paper discusses the use of CAMD for the optimal design of novel precursor materials. This involves generating molecules with optimal properties from functional groups. Properties related to the CAMD process, such as optimization parameters and generated molecule properties, should be included.

3. **Enhanced Properties for Precursors**:
   The paper mentions the design of novel titanium precursors with enhanced properties. Properties that describe these enhancements, such as growth rates and optimal deposition conditions, should be added to the schema.

4. **Thermodynamic Properties from GCM**:
   The paper uses thermodynamic properties obtained from GCM for the CAMD framework. Including properties that describe these thermodynamic parameters, such as interaction parameters and activity coefficients, would be beneficial.

5. **Validation and Testing**:
   The paper discusses the validation of the growth rates of ALD systems theoretically. Including properties related to experimental validation, such as experimental growth rates and conditions, would help in comparing theoretical predictions with actual results.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the above points:
