Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to better represent the details of the ALD process, particularly focusing on the correlation between the growth-per-cycle (GPC) and the surface OH group concentration, as well as the reaction mechanisms involving trimethylaluminum and water.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Growth-Per-Cycle (GPC) Property:**
   - The research paper emphasizes the importance of GPC and its correlation with surface OH group concentration. This property is crucial for understanding the efficiency of the ALD process.

2. **Enhancement of Reaction Mechanisms:**
   - The paper provides detailed reaction mechanisms which are not fully captured in the current schema. Specifically, the reactions involving ligand exchange, dissociation/association, and the effect of steric hindrance should be included.

3. **Inclusion of Surface OH Group Concentration:**
   - Since the GPC is correlated with the surface OH group concentration, this property should be explicitly included in the schema.

4. **Adjustments Based on Temperature and Surface Treatment:**
   - The paper discusses how reaction temperature and substrate heat-treatment temperature affect the reaction mechanisms and GPC. These factors should be more explicitly detailed in the schema.
