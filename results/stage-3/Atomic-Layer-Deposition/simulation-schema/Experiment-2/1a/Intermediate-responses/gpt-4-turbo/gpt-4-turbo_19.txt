Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional details about the area-selective ALD process, particularly focusing on the use of electron beam-induced deposition (EBID) for area activation and the effects of deposition temperature on selectivity. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
