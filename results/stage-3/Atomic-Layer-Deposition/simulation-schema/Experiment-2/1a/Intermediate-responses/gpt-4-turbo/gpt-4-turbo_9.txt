Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on the nuances of gas-phase and liquid-phase techniques, dissociation mechanisms, and the modeling of chemical reactions.

### Refinements to the Current Schema:

1. **Precursor Properties**:
   - Add properties for `state` (gas or liquid) to differentiate between gas-phase and liquid-phase processes.
   - Include `dissociationMechanism` to describe the dissociation behavior of the precursor, which is crucial for understanding different growth modes.

2. **Process Conditions**:
   - Modify `temperature` and `pressure` properties to use numerical values instead of strings to allow for precise calculations and comparisons.
   - Add `cycleType` to distinguish between half-cycles and full cycles, as described in the paper.

3. **Simulation Results**:
   - Introduce properties under `simulationResults` to capture growth rate and film roughness, which are critical outputs from the simulations discussed in the paper.

4. **Chemical Kinetics**:
   - Expand to include detailed reaction pathways and their rate constants, which are essential for understanding the kinetics at a molecular level.

### New Properties Based on the Research Paper:

1. **New Object for Liquid-Phase Technique**:
   - This object will encapsulate properties specific to liquid-phase processes such as solvent type, stoichiometry of precursors, and specific reactions in solution.

2. **Detailed Reaction Mechanisms**:
   - Given the complexity and importance of reaction mechanisms in ALD as highlighted in the paper, a more detailed representation of possible reactions (including ligand exchange and dissociation pathways) should be added.
