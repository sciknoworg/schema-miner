Based on the research paper and the domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed modeling of the reaction kinetics, particularly focusing on the cooperative effects and migration processes described in the paper. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
