Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following refinements are proposed to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy, particularly focusing on the area-selective ALD process using chemoselective inhibitors:

### 1. Adding New Properties:
- **Chemoselective Inhibitor**: The research paper introduces the use of a chemoselective inhibitor (acetylacetone) in an ABC-type ALD cycle. This is a critical component for achieving area-selective deposition, which is not currently represented in the schema.

- **ABC-Type Cycle**: The paper describes a specific ALD cycle type (ABC-type) that is essential for the process discussed. This should be included to differentiate from other cycle types.

- **Surface Selectivity**: The paper discusses the selectivity of the process based on the surface material, which is a key aspect of the area-selective ALD process.

### 2. Refining Existing Properties:
- **AreaSelectiveALD**: Enhance this section to include properties related to the ABC-type cycle and the use of chemoselective inhibitors.

- **SubstrateDetails**: Include properties that describe the different surface materials and their roles in the selectivity of the deposition process.

### 3. Schema Update:
