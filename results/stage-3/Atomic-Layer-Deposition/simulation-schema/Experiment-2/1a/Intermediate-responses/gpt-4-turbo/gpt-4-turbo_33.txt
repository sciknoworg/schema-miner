Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties related to the deposition of zirconium and hafnium oxide films using metal chlorides and water vapor as precursors. The schema should also account for the kinetics and mechanism of film growth, including the effects of temperature on the deposition rate and residual chlorine concentration.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary updates:

This schema now includes the necessary details for handling zirconium and hafnium oxide films, addressing the specificities of their deposition processes as described in the research paper. It also ensures that the schema is comprehensive and adaptable to different materials and conditions used in ALD processes.
