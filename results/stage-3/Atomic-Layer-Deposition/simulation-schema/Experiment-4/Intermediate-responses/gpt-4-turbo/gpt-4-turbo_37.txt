Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness in representing the ALD process for alumina deposition using TMA and H2O. The research paper provides detailed insights into the effects of reactor geometry, gas flow, and temperature fields on the deposition process, which are crucial for understanding the distribution of reactants and the uniformity of the film deposited.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Reactor Geometry and Gas Flow Dynamics:**
   - The schema lacks properties related to reactor geometry and the dynamics of gas flow, which are critical as per the research paper. These properties influence the distribution of reactants and temperature, affecting the uniformity of the deposited film.

2. **Temperature Fields:**
   - The schema should include properties that describe the temperature distribution within the reactor, not just the operating temperature. This includes temperatures at different reactor zones (e.g., loading door, side walls).

3. **Reactant Distribution:**
   - Properties related to the spatial distribution of reactants on the substrate should be added. This is crucial as non-uniform reactant distribution can lead to non-uniform film thickness.

4. **Purging Dynamics:**
   - Detailed properties related to purging dynamics, including purging flow rates through different inlets and their impact on reactant removal, should be included.

5. **CFD Simulation Results:**
   - Incorporate properties that can store data from CFD simulations, such as velocity fields, pressure distributions, and reactant concentrations over time. This would be valuable for advanced modeling and analysis.

6. **Surface Reactions and By-products:**
   - Properties detailing the surface reactions, by-products, and their handling within the reactor need to be defined. This includes the handling of methane produced during the ALD process.
