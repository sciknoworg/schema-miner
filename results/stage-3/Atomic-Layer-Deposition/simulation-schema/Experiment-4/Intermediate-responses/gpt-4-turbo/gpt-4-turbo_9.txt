Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness for the ALD process, particularly focusing on the simulation aspects and the inclusion of liquid-phase processes.

### Refinements and Additions:

1. **Inclusion of Liquid-Phase ALD Processes:**
   - The current schema primarily focuses on gas-phase ALD processes. The research paper introduces a liquid-phase ALD process using Al(O-sec-Bu)3/H2O solvated in 2-butanol. This necessitates the addition of properties related to liquid-phase precursors and conditions.

2. **Simulation Details:**
   - The paper discusses the use of rule-based deposition and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The schema should include properties that describe simulation parameters such as rule-based deposition details and MD relaxation details.

3. **Precursor Dissociation Mechanisms:**
   - The paper highlights the importance of dissociation mechanisms in the growth process, particularly for TMA in gas-phase ALD. This should be reflected in the schema by adding properties related to dissociation pathways and their effects on film growth.

4. **Precipitation Mechanism in Liquid-Phase ALD:**
   - A significant finding from the paper is the precipitation mechanism during liquid-phase ALD, which affects film roughness and growth rate. Properties related to precipitation should be added.

5. **Enhanced Details on Surface Reactions:**
   - The schema should include more detailed properties related to surface reactions, such as ligand exchange and hydrolysis reactions, which are crucial for understanding the ALD process as described in the paper.
