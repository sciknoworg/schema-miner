Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) process, particularly focusing on the simulation aspects and the impact of various parameters on the deposition process.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Simulation Details:**
   - The schema lacks details on the simulation methods used in PEALD, such as Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. These are crucial for understanding the deposition process at an atomic level.

2. **Inclusion of Precursor Details:**
   - The schema should include more detailed information about the precursors used, especially focusing on their reaction probabilities and the impact of these probabilities on film properties.

3. **Process Parameters:**
   - The schema should explicitly include process parameters like temperature, pressure, and plasma energy, which significantly affect the deposition outcomes.

4. **Observable Properties Enhancement:**
   - The schema should include more detailed observable properties such as film density and growth per cycle, which are influenced by the occupation probabilities of precursor products.

5. **Steric Effects and Surface Sites:**
   - Information about steric hindrance and surface site availability should be included to provide insights into how these factors influence the growth and properties of the deposited films.
