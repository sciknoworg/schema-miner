Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to better represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on the alumina deposition process described in the paper. The paper provides detailed insights into the reaction mechanisms, the role of surface intermediates, and the effects of process conditions on the growth rate, which are currently not adequately captured in the schema.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties for Alumina Precursors:**
   - The paper discusses the use of trimethylaluminium (TMA) and water (H2O) as precursors for alumina deposition. These should be added to the schema.

2. **Surface Intermediates and Reaction Mechanism:**
   - The paper describes the surface intermediates and their concentrations, which are crucial for understanding the ALD process. We should include properties to represent these intermediates and their effects on the growth rate.

3. **Process Conditions:**
   - The paper emphasizes the importance of temperature and other process conditions on the growth rate and the surface structure. We need to refine the `processConditions` to include more specific details.

4. **Observable Properties:**
   - The paper provides insights into the crystalline structure and other properties of the deposited films. We should ensure these are well-represented.

### Notes:
- The schema now includes a new section for alumina precursors.
- The `processConditions` and `observableProperties` have been updated to reflect the insights from the paper.
- Further iterations may include more detailed properties based on additional research papers and expert feedback.
