Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process can be refined to include new properties and constraints that address the nuances of area-selective deposition using small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and the specific interactions of these inhibitors with the ALD process. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the insights from the research paper and expert feedback:
