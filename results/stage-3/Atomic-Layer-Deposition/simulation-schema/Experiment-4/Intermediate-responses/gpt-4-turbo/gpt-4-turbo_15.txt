### Changes Made:
1. Added a new precursor `Hf(N(CH3)2)4` with properties such as `adsorptionSites`, `stericEffects`, and `cooperativeEffects` based on the research paper.
2. Included `filmThickness` under `observableProperties` to account for the measurement of film growth, which is crucial for evaluating the ALD process.
3. Retained existing properties and refined descriptions for clarity and alignment with the research paper insights.

This schema now better reflects the complexities and specifics of the ALD process as described in the research paper and incorporates expert feedback for enhanced accuracy and detail.
