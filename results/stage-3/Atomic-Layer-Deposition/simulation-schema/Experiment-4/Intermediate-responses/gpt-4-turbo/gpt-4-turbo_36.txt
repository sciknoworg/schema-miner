Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following updates and refinements are proposed:

1. **Addition of Surface OH Group Concentration Property:**
   The research paper emphasizes the importance of surface OH group concentration in determining the growth-per-cycle (GPC) of the ALD process. This property is not currently represented in the schema.

2. **Addition of Growth-Per-Cycle (GPC) Property:**
   The paper discusses the correlation between GPC and surface OH group concentration, which is a critical aspect of the ALD process efficiency and effectiveness. This property should be added to the schema.

3. **Refinement of Reaction Mechanisms:**
   The paper suggests that multiple reaction mechanisms, including ligand exchange and dissociation/association, occur simultaneously. This complexity should be reflected in the `reactionMechanisms` property.

4. **Inclusion of Steric Hindrance Information:**
   The paper discusses how steric hindrance by adsorbed methyl groups terminates the reaction. This aspect should be included in the schema to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the process limitations.

5. **Adjustment of Kinetic Modeling:**
   The paper provides a quantitative description of the effect of surface OH groups on the surface chemistry and GPC, which should be incorporated into the `kineticModeling` section of the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
