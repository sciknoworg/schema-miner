Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the following updates and additions are proposed to refine the schema for the ALD process, particularly focusing on the area-selective deposition of In2O3:H using a μ-plasma printer:

1. **Addition of New Properties for In2O3:H Precursors**:
   - The paper discusses the use of Indium cyclopentadienyl (InCp) as a precursor for In2O3:H. This precursor and its specific properties related to the ALD process should be added to the schema.

2. **Inclusion of Microscale Patterning and μ-Plasma Printing**:
   - The paper introduces a novel method involving μ-plasma printing for surface activation, which is crucial for the selective deposition of In2O3:H. This method and its parameters should be included in the schema.

3. **Update to Process Conditions**:
   - Specific details about the reactor pressure and temperature during the ALD cycles are provided in the paper. These should be updated in the schema to reflect the precise conditions used for In2O3:H deposition.

4. **Addition of Substrate Information**:
   - Information about the substrates used, such as a-Si:H and a-SiNx:H, and their preparation methods should be included.

5. **Enhancement of Observable Properties**:
   - The paper provides detailed measurements of film thickness and resistivity, which are critical observable properties in the ALD process. These should be detailed in the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the above updates:
