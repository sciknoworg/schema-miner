Based on the provided research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the ALD process, particularly focusing on the alumina deposition using TMA and water as precursors. The research paper provides detailed insights into the physical and chemical processes involved in ALD, emphasizing the importance of surface reactions, precursor distributions, and the effects of process conditions like temperature and purging time.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Add New Properties for Precursor Distribution and Surface Reactions:**
   - The schema should include properties that describe the distribution of precursors within the ALD chamber, as this significantly affects the deposition rate and film uniformity.
   - Surface reaction kinetics and mechanisms based on atomic-level studies should be incorporated to provide a more detailed understanding of the deposition process.

2. **Enhance Process Conditions:**
   - Include properties that detail the effects of purging time and carrier gas flow rate on the deposition process, as these factors are crucial for understanding the dynamics within the ALD chamber.
   - Add properties that capture the temperature-dependent behavior of the deposition process, reflecting the experimental observations and numerical simulations discussed in the paper.

3. **Detailed Description of Observable Properties:**
   - Refine the `filmProperties` to include properties like growth rate per cycle and surface coverage, which are critical for assessing the quality and consistency of the ALD films.
   - Include properties that describe the uniformity of the film thickness across different substrate locations within the chamber.

4. **Simulation Data Enhancements:**
   - Expand the `simulationData` to include detailed models of precursor flow and surface reactions, as these are essential for predictive modeling and optimization of the ALD process.
   - Incorporate findings from numerical simulations regarding the impact of process parameters on film growth and properties.
