### Changes Made:
1. **Kinetic Modeling**: Added a new section to capture the detailed reaction mechanisms and computational methods used in kinetic modeling, as highlighted in the research paper. This includes methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which are crucial for predicting growth rates and understanding the chemical reactions at both the gas phase and surface level.

2. **Reaction Mechanisms**: Included a property to list detailed reaction mechanisms that are observed or predicted in simulations, which is essential for understanding the specific reactions involved in the ALD process, especially for materials like gallium nitride (GaN).

These refinements ensure that the schema is more aligned with the complexities and specifics of the ALD process as described in the research paper, providing a more accurate and comprehensive representation.
