Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be updated to include properties related to the use of N2O plasma reactants and their effects on the electrical characteristics of IGZO TFTs. The schema should also reflect the impact of selective N2O plasma reactant application on different cation elements in the IGZO system.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these updates:
