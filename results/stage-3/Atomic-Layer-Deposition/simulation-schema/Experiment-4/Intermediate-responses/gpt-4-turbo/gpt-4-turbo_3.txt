Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on Spatial ALD (SALD) and the impact of precursor exposure on process efficiency and film properties.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of Spatial ALD Properties**:
   - The schema should include properties specific to SALD, such as substrate velocity and the gap between the substrate and the injection head, which are critical in controlling precursor exposure.

2. **Precursor Exposure**:
   - The schema should model the precursor exposure time and concentration, which are crucial for achieving optimal film properties and process efficiency in SALD.

3. **Film Properties**:
   - The schema should include more detailed properties of the films, such as mass density and texture coefficients, which are influenced by the growth rate and precursor exposure.

4. **Process Efficiency**:
   - Introduce a new property to quantify process efficiency, which considers growth rate, precursor consumption, and deposition time.

5. **Modeling and Simulation Data**:
   - Include properties that can store simulation data, such as effective exposure and growth per cycle (GPC), which are used to optimize the SALD process.
