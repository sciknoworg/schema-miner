Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, we need to refine the schema to include the specifics of the ALD process for silicon carbide (SiC), particularly focusing on the precursors and conditions that are favorable for SiC deposition at lower temperatures. The paper provides detailed information on various silicon and carbon precursors and their thermodynamic favorability for SiC deposition, which is crucial for enhancing the schema.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Add New Precursors for SiC Deposition:**
   - The paper identifies several precursors that are thermodynamically favorable for SiC deposition at lower temperatures (400°C). These include disilane (Si2H6), silane (SiH4), monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl), ethyne (C2H2), carbontetrachloride (CCl4), and trichloromethane (CHCl3). These should be added to the schema under a new category for SiC precursors.

2. **Update Process Conditions:**
   - Include a specific section for SiC deposition conditions, highlighting the lower temperature range (around 400°C) and the partial pressures used in the experiments.

3. **Add Thermodynamic Data:**
   - Include properties related to Gibbs energy calculations for the reactions involving the new precursors, as this data is crucial for understanding the feasibility of these reactions under specified conditions.

4. **Document Reaction Products and By-products:**
   - The schema should include possible reaction products and by-products for each precursor combination, as indicated by the thermodynamic analysis in the paper.

5. **Enhance Documentation and Descriptions:**
   - Each new property and precursor should be well-documented with descriptions, including the source (i.e., derived from theoretical calculations or experimental data).
