The updated schema includes the following changes:

1. Added a new property `simulationMethodology` to the `parameters` group, which includes the simulation methodology used, such as DFT functional and convergence criteria.
2. Added new properties `bindingEnergy` and `dissociationEnergy` to the `simulationParameters` group, which represent the binding and dissociation energies of the etched material.
3. Added units to the `temperature`, `pressure`, `plasmaPower`, and `exposureTime` properties to reflect the units used in the research paper.
4. Generalized the units for `pressure` to allow for differences in reporting.
5. Expanded the `simulationParameters` group to include both string and number properties for written descriptions of results and numerical properties, respectively.
6. Grouped related parameters in nested objects as needed to reflect the Atomic Layer Etching process structure.
