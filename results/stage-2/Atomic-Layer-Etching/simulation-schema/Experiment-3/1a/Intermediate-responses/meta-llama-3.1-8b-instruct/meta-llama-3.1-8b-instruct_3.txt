This refined schema includes the following changes:

1. Added a new property "reactantChemicals" to the "inputs" object, which contains the first and second pulse reactants used in the ALE process.
2. Added a new property "processWindow" to the schema, which contains the pressure-temperature process window for the ALE process.
3. Updated the "simulationParameters" object to include the "methods" and "methodDetails" properties, which describe the computational methods used in the ALD simulation.
4. Updated the "bombardmentParameters" object to include the "bombardmentEnergy" and "etchingProducts" properties, which describe the energy used for bombardment and the products formed during the etching process.
5. Added descriptions and units to the properties where applicable.

This refined schema should accurately represent the Atomic Layer Etching process, including its inputs, parameters, and outputs, as well as the pressure-temperature process window for the ALE process.
