Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include additional details about the chemisorption characteristics, the influence of steric hindrance, and the use of surfactants and water to modify the adsorption chemistry. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:
