Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined to include more detailed and specific properties related to the ALD of TiO2 from TiI4 and H2O onto SiO2 surfaces. The schema now better reflects the complexities and specifics of the ALD process as described in the research, including reaction mechanisms, precursor interactions, and surface functionalities.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
