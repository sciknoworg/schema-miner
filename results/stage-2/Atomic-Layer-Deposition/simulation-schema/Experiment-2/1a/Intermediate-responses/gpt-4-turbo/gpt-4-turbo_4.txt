Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the details of the ALD process, particularly focusing on the selective growth mechanism of AlOx using dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) as a precursor. The research paper provides detailed insights into the reaction mechanisms, the role of co-reactants, and the conditions under which the ALD process operates, which can be used to enhance the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the insights from the research paper:

### Changes Made:
1. **Selectivity Property**: Added under the precursor to describe the precursor's selectivity towards specific sites on the substrate, which is crucial for understanding the selective growth mechanism described in the paper.
2. **Cycle Parameters**: Added under process conditions to detail the number of cycles and the duration of each cycle, which are important for achieving the desired coating properties and are discussed in the paper.

These refinements ensure that the schema is more comprehensive and accurately represents the complexities and specifics of the ALD process as described in the research paper.
