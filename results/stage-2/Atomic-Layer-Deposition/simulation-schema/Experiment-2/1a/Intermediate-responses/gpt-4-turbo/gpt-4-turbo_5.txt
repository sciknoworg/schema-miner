Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on the chemisorption characteristics, growth per cycle (GPC), and the effects of steric hindrance and ligand chemistry.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Chemisorption Characteristics**:
   - Add properties to describe the chemisorption behavior of precursors, including the interaction type (e.g., dissociative chemisorption) and the specific reactions involved.

2. **Growth Per Cycle (GPC)**:
   - Introduce a new property to quantify the growth per cycle, which is a critical performance metric in ALD processes.

3. **Steric Hindrance**:
   - Include details about the steric hindrance effects, which influence the density of chemisorbed precursor and ultimately the GPC.

4. **Ligand Chemistry**:
   - Add properties to describe the ligand chemistry of the precursor, particularly how modifications to ligand types (e.g., replacing methoxy with hydroxyl groups) can enhance the GPC.

5. **Surface Termination Chemistry**:
   - Include properties that describe the surface termination chemistry and its impact on precursor adsorption and GPC.

6. **Experimental Conditions**:
   - Expand the `processConditions` to include details about the experimental setup such as the type of reactor used, substrate details, and specific sequence timings for precursor feeding and purging.
