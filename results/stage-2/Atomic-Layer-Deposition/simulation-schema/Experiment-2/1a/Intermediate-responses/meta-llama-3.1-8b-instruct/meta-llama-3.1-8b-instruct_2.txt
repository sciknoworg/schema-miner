The updated schema includes the following new properties:

* `aldProcessParameters`: This property contains the parameters specific to the ALD process, including the zirconium precursor, water precursor, surface hydroxyl groups, adsorption energy, activation barrier, and desorption energy.
* `zirconiumPrecursor`: This property specifies the zirconium precursor used in the ALD process (e.g., ZrCl4).
* `waterPrecursor`: This property specifies the water precursor used in the ALD process (e.g., H2O).
