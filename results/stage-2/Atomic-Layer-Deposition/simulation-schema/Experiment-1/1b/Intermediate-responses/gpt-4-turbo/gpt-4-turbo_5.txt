Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties related to the chemisorption characteristics, growth per cycle (GPC), and the effects of steric hindrance. The schema should also clearly differentiate between input parameters and results from simulations or experiments.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

This schema now includes a new property under `filmProperties` for `growthPerCycle`, reflecting the influence of chemisorption and steric hindrance on the growth rate per cycle, which is a critical aspect highlighted in the research paper. Additionally, the schema maintains a clear distinction between input parameters and results, aligning with expert feedback for better clarity and organization.
