Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on the chlorine loss reactions in ZrO2 thin films. The schema should also differentiate between simulation and experimental results where applicable. Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes a more detailed breakdown of the reaction mechanisms, specifically the chlorine loss reactions, and differentiates between simulation parameters and experimental results. It also aligns with the expert's feedback on property grouping and the need for clarity in simulation versus experimental data.
