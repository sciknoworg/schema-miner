Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties related to the chemistry of copper precursors, particularly focusing on the Cu(acac)2 precursor and its interactions with various co-reactants. The schema should also clearly differentiate between input parameters and results from simulations or experimental observations.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary changes:

This schema now includes a clear distinction between input parameters and results, incorporates the specific metal precursor Cu(acac)2, and adds a property for the process temperature. It also maintains the structure for detailing the reaction mechanisms and film properties based on simulation or experimental results.
