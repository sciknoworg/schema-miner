Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed properties related to the precursor and its decomposition mechanisms, as well as to better organize the properties related to simulation results and input parameters. Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes additional precursors with their purpose, which addresses the need for more detailed precursor information as highlighted in the research paper. The schema also maintains a clear distinction between input parameters and simulation results, aligning with expert feedback for better organization.
