Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements have been made to the ALD process JSON schema:

1. **Selective Encapsulation**: Added properties related to selective encapsulation, which is a significant aspect of the ALD process as described in the paper.
2. **Precursor Details**: Enhanced the details about precursors, including specific properties of dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) and its role in selective growth.
3. **Microkinetic Modeling**: Introduced properties related to microkinetic modeling, which is crucial for understanding the deposition rates and mechanisms.
4. **Hydroxylation and Hydrolyzation**: Added properties to capture the role of hydroxylation and hydrolyzation in the ALD process, as these are key mechanisms in the selective growth described.
5. **Substituent Effects**: Included properties to capture the effects of substituents in precursors, which influence the selectivity and efficiency of the ALD process.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
