Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following updates and refinements have been made to the ALD process JSON schema:

1. **Incorporation of Chemisorption Characteristics**: The research paper highlights the importance of chemisorption characteristics, particularly the steric hindrance and ligand effects on growth per cycle (GPC). This necessitates the addition of properties related to chemisorption and steric hindrance.

2. **Addition of Ligand and Steric Hindrance Properties**: The paper discusses the impact of ligand geometry and steric hindrance on the ALD process. Properties related to ligand type and steric hindrance have been added to capture these effects.

3. **Enhancement of Growth Rate Properties**: The paper emphasizes the role of chemisorbed precursor density in determining the growth rate. This has been incorporated into the growth rate section.

4. **Inclusion of Surface Termination Chemistry**: The paper discusses the role of surface termination chemistry in the ALD process. This has been added to the surface properties section.

5. **Refinement of Existing Properties**: Based on expert feedback, some existing properties have been refined for clarity and accuracy.
