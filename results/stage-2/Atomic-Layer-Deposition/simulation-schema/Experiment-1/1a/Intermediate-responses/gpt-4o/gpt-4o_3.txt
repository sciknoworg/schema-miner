Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements have been made to the ALD process JSON schema:

1. **New Properties Added**:
   - **Precursor Chemistry**: Added details about the precursor's adsorption sites and dissociation pathways, as these are critical for understanding the ALD process.
   - **Co-reactant Reactivity**: Included a property to capture the reactivity order of co-reactants, which is crucial for process optimization.

2. **Existing Properties Validated and Modified**:
   - **Materials**: Enhanced the description of precursors to include specific types like Cu(acac)2 and their behavior on different substrates.
   - **Surface Properties**: Updated to include details about site blocking by ligands and the role of co-reactants in ligand removal.

3. **Expert Recommendations Applied**:
   - **Reactivity and Energetics**: Incorporated expert feedback to better describe the energetics of surface reactions and the role of different co-reactants.
   - **Temperature Constraints**: Added constraints related to the temperature windows for different co-reactants, as suggested by experts.

4. **Documentation and Organization**:
   - Improved descriptions and added units where necessary to ensure clarity and consistency across the schema.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
