Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements and additions are made to the ALD process JSON schema:

1. **Incorporate Surface Functionalities**: The research paper highlights the importance of different surface functionalities such as isolated hydroxyl groups, adjacent hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups, and oxygen bridges. These should be included in the schema to capture the complexity of surface reactions.

2. **Add Reaction Pathways and Energetics**: The paper discusses reaction pathways and energetics, which are crucial for understanding the ALD process. These should be added to the schema to provide a comprehensive view of the process.

3. **Include Surface Reactive Sites**: The presence of different reactive sites on the substrate, such as siloxane bridges, should be captured in the schema.

4. **Refine Existing Properties**: Ensure that existing properties such as `precursors` and `coReactants` are aligned with the specific examples and mechanisms discussed in the paper.

5. **Add New Properties for Surface Reactions**: Based on the paper, properties related to surface reactions, such as adsorption energies and transition states, should be added.
