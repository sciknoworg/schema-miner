Based on the provided research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties and details that are relevant to the process, especially focusing on the interactions of TiI4 and H2O with SiO2 surfaces, the effects of quantum tunneling, and the hindered rotations of adsorbates. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:

This schema now includes a new section `quantumEffects` to account for quantum tunneling and hindered rotations, which are significant in understanding the reaction dynamics as per the research paper. Additionally, the existing sections have been retained and refined to ensure they are comprehensive and align with the latest research findings.
