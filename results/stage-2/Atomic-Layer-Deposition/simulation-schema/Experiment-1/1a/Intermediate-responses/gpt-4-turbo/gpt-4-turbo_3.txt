Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the ALD process involving copper precursors, particularly Cu(acac)2. The research paper provides detailed insights into the surface chemistry, reaction mechanisms, and the role of co-reactants which are crucial for accurately modeling the ALD process.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Add Precursor Details**:
   - Include specific details about the precursor, such as its chemical structure and reactivity with different surfaces and co-reactants.

2. **Update Reaction Mechanisms**:
   - The schema should reflect the detailed reaction pathways and intermediate states as described in the paper, including the dissociation sequences and the effects of co-reactants like H2, atomic H, H2O, and O3.

3. **Co-reactants and By-products**:
   - Add properties to describe the co-reactants used and the by-products formed during the ALD process. This includes the formation of compounds like H(acac), CO2, and H2O as described in the paper.

4. **Surface Interactions**:
   - Include properties that describe how the precursor interacts with different types of surfaces (e.g., Cu, Cu2O, CuO) and the associated reaction energies and barriers.

5. **Temperature and Pressure Conditions**:
   - The schema should include properties for the temperature and pressure conditions under which the reactions occur, as these are critical for the ALD process.

6. **Dynamic Properties**:
   - Incorporate properties that can capture the dynamic nature of the reactions, such as time evolution of species during the reaction as observed in RMD simulations.
