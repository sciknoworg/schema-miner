Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the details of the ALD process, particularly focusing on the selective growth mechanism using dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) as a precursor. The research paper provides detailed insights into the selective encapsulation of Pt nanoparticles, the decomposition mechanisms of DMAI, and the effects of substituents on precursor reactivity and selectivity.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Precursor Substituent Effects:** The paper discusses the substituent effects in DMAI, which influence the reactivity and selectivity of the ALD process. This can be represented in the schema under `precursors` properties.
   - **Selective Encapsulation:** The ability of DMAI to selectively encapsulate Pt (111) facets should be explicitly mentioned in the schema.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties:**
   - **Precursors:** Update the `precursors` property to include details about the specific interactions of DMAI with Pt facets, as well as its decomposition pathways.
   - **Reaction Mechanisms:** Enhance the `reactionMechanisms` to include microkinetic models and the role of water in facilitating the decomposition of intermediates.

3. **Enhanced Descriptions and Constraints:**
   - Provide more detailed descriptions for each property, especially explaining the role of DMAI and its selective interaction with Pt (111) facets.
   - Add constraints or expected values where applicable, such as the specific temperature range for effective ALD processing with DMAI.
