Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to enhance the schema's accuracy and comprehensiveness for the ALD process, particularly focusing on the chemisorption characteristics, steric hindrance effects, and the use of surfactants and water in the process.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Chemisorption Characteristics**:
   - The paper discusses the chemisorption behavior of the Ti precursor and its impact on growth per cycle (GPC). This suggests adding properties related to chemisorption characteristics, including the reaction energy and the specific interactions (e.g., Tiâ€“O bond formation).

2. **Steric Hindrance**:
   - The steric hindrance effect is crucial in determining the GPC. Properties related to the geometry of ligands and their impact on steric hindrance should be included.

3. **Surfactants and Water Usage**:
   - The use of surfactants and water to modify surface chemistry and enhance precursor chemisorption is highlighted. Properties detailing the types of surfactants used, their effects, and the role of water in reducing steric hindrance should be added.

4. **GPC (Growth Per Cycle)**:
   - Directly related to the efficiency of the ALD process, properties detailing the GPC and factors affecting it (like chemisorption and steric hindrance) should be included.

5. **Precursor Reactivity with Water and Ozone**:
   - The reactivity differences between water and ozone with the precursor, which affect the GPC, should be captured.
