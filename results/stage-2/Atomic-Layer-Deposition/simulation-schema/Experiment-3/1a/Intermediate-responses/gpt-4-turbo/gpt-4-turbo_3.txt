Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process for copper metal and copper oxide deposition using copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) as detailed in the research.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Precursors and Co-reactants:**
   - The schema should include `Cu(acac)2` as a specific precursor for copper-based ALD processes.
   - Include co-reactants such as `H2O`, `O3`, and atomic `H` which are used in different ALD processes as described in the paper.

2. **Surface Chemistry and Reaction Mechanisms:**
   - Detailed reaction mechanisms involving the dissociation of `Cu(acac)2` into `Cu` and `acac` ligands and their interaction with co-reactants should be added.
   - Include properties for by-products such as `CO2`, `H2O`, and other species formed during the reactions.

3. **Temperature and Pressure Conditions:**
   - The schema should specify the temperature ranges for different ALD processes as mentioned (e.g., 85-135°C for plasma-enhanced ALD with H, 150-230°C with O3).
   - Include properties for reaction conditions like `temperature` and `pressure` specific to each precursor and co-reactant combination.

4. **Reactor Design Adjustments:**
   - Include properties that might affect the reaction such as `surfaceType` (e.g., Cu(110), Cu2O(111), CuO(111)) which influences the reactivity and the process outcomes.

5. **Dynamic Properties:**
   - Properties related to dynamic changes in the system such as `timeEvolutionOfSpecies` which tracks the changes in concentration of various species over time during the ALD process.
