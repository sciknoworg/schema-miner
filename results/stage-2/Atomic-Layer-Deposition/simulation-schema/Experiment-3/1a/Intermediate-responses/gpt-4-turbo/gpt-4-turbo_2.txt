Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema can be refined to better represent the ALD process for ZrO2 deposition on SiO2 surfaces. The research paper provides detailed insights into the reaction mechanisms, precursors, and surface interactions which are crucial for accurately modeling the ALD process.

### Refinements Based on Research Paper:

1. **Precursors and Surface Interaction**:
   - The paper specifies ZrCl4 and H2O as precursors and details their interaction with hydroxylated SiO2 surfaces. This interaction leads to the formation of intermediate complexes and the evolution of HCl, which are critical to the ALD process.
   - Add properties to capture the formation of intermediate complexes and the by-products (e.g., HCl) of the reactions.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:
   - The paper discusses the reaction mechanisms in two half-cycles involving the formation of SiO2–O–Zr–Cl/C3 surface sites and subsequent reactions with water. These details are crucial for understanding the layer-by-layer growth in ALD.
   - Enhance the `reactionMechanism` object to include these half-cycle reactions and their energetics.

3. **Surface Sites**:
   - The interaction of precursors with multiple surface hydroxyl groups and the formation of stable complexes are highlighted. This affects the growth rate and uniformity of the film.
   - Include properties that describe the surface site interactions and the effects of multiple hydroxyl groups.

4. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - The paper uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to simulate the reactions. This indicates the importance of computational methods in predicting the process outcomes.
   - Ensure the `methodologyUsed` array includes DFT and other relevant computational chemistry methods.
