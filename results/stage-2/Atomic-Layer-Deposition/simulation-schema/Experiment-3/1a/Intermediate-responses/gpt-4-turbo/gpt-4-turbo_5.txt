Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to better represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on the chemisorption characteristics, growth per cycle (GPC), and the effects of steric hindrance.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Chemisorption Characteristics**:
   - The paper discusses the importance of chemisorption characteristics of the precursor, which affects the growth per cycle (GPC). This should be explicitly included in the schema.

2. **Growth Per Cycle (GPC)**:
   - GPC is a critical metric in ALD, influenced by the amount of chemisorbed precursor. This property should be added to the schema.

3. **Steric Hindrance**:
   - The paper highlights the role of steric hindrance in limiting GPC. Properties related to the ligand geometry and its effects on steric hindrance should be included.

4. **Surface Termination Chemistry**:
   - The interaction between the precursor and the surface termination chemistry is crucial for understanding the adsorption and reaction mechanisms. This should be detailed in the schema.

5. **Use of Surfactants and Water**:
   - The role of surfactants and water in modifying the surface chemistry and enhancing GPC should be included, noting the potential contamination issues with surfactants.

6. **Precursor Reactivity with Water and Ozone**:
   - The reactivity of the precursor with different reactants like water and ozone, which affects the GPC and the overall ALD process, should be documented.
