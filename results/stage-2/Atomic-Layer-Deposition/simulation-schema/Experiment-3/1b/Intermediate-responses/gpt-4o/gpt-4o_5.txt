Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, I have refined the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process. The updates include the addition of new properties related to chemisorption and steric hindrance, as well as adjustments to existing properties to improve clarity and accuracy.

### Key Updates:
1. **Chemisorbed Precursor Density**: Added under `growthRate` to capture the density of chemisorbed precursors, which is crucial for understanding growth per cycle (GPC) as highlighted in the research paper.
2. **Steric Hindrance**: Added under `surfaceProperties` to account for the impact of steric hindrance on surface reactions, as discussed in the paper.
3. **Clarifications and Corrections**: Adjusted descriptions and examples for clarity, ensuring that computational methods and materials are correctly categorized.
4. **Removed Substrate Velocity**: As per expert feedback, the substrate velocity was removed since it was deemed irrelevant.

These changes aim to enhance the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy, reflecting the latest insights from the research paper and expert feedback.
