Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, I will refine the current JSON schema for the ALD process. The research paper highlights the importance of surface reactions, the role of different reactive sites, and the use of specific computational methods and models. The expert feedback suggests improvements in the methodology section and clarifies the use of computational methods. Here is the refined JSON schema:

### Key Changes:
1. **Simulation Parameters**: Added `functionals` and `basisSets` with examples to provide more detail on the methodology, as suggested by the expert feedback.
2. **Materials**: Retained the structure but ensured clarity in the description of precursors, co-reactants, and substrates.
3. **Growth Rate**: No changes were made as the properties align with the research paper's focus on growth mechanisms.
4. **Surface Properties**: Retained the structure but ensured clarity in the description of properties related to surface reactions.
5. **Film Properties**: No changes were made as the properties align with the research paper's focus on film characteristics.
6. **Reactor Conditions**: Removed `substrateVelocity` as it was deemed unnecessary by the expert feedback.
7. **Selective Growth Mechanism**: Retained the structure but ensured clarity in the description of selective growth conditions.

This refined schema incorporates insights from the research paper and expert feedback, ensuring it is comprehensive and accurate for representing the ALD process.
