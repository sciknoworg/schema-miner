Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes additional properties related to the selective growth mechanism using dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) as a precursor, and adjustments have been made to better organize and clarify existing properties.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

Changes made:
1. Added a new property under `reactionMechanisms` named `selectiveGrowthMechanism` to describe the selective growth mechanism using DMAI as a precursor.
2. Reorganized the `simulationParameters` to separate input parameters from the results parameters as suggested by the domain expert.
3. Ensured all descriptions are clear and informative, aligning with the expert's feedback on clarity.
