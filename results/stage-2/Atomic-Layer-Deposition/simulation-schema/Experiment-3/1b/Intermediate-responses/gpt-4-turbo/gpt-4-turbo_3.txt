Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes additional properties related to the surface chemistry of copper metal and copper oxide ALD from copper(II) acetylacetonate, as well as adjustments to existing properties to enhance clarity and accuracy.
