Based on the provided research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process has been refined. The schema now includes additional properties and modifications to better align with the detailed atomic growth mechanisms and the effects of quantum tunneling and hindered rotations of adsorbates on the rate of surface reactions as described in the research paper.

Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes a more detailed breakdown of the simulation parameters, specifically separating input parameters from reaction mechanisms, and includes a more comprehensive description of the methodologies used. Additionally, the schema reflects the complexity of the ALD process as described in the research paper, including the effects of quantum tunneling and hindered rotations.
