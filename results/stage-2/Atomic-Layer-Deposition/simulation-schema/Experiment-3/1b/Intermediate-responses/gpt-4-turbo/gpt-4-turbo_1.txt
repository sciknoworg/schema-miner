Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include more detailed reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on the chlorine loss reactions in ZrO2 thin films. The schema should also differentiate between simulation and experimental results where applicable. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these changes:

This schema now includes a new section under `simulationParameters` for `chlorineLossReactions`, detailing the reaction pathways and the effects of temperature, which are critical for understanding the specific reactions involved in the deposition of ZrO2 thin films as described in the research paper.
