Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process needs to be refined to include more detailed properties related to the reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on the initial surface reactions and the influence of surface heterogeneity. The schema should also clearly differentiate between input parameters and results from simulations or experiments.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the necessary changes:

This refined schema now includes a more detailed breakdown of the reaction mechanisms, specifically addressing the initial surface reactions and the effects of surface heterogeneity, which are crucial for understanding the ALD process as described in the research paper. It also clearly separates input parameters from the results of simulations or experiments, addressing the expert's feedback.
