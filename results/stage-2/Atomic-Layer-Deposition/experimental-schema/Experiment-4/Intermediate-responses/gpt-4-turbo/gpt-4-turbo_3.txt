Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process for hafnium and zirconium oxides using metal amide precursors. The research paper provides detailed insights into the deposition process, precursor characteristics, and film properties which are not fully captured in the current schema.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Precursor Properties**:
   - Add properties related to the vapor pressure and reactivity of the precursors, which are crucial for understanding their behavior in the ALD process.
   - Include properties for the temperature range over which the precursors are effective, as detailed in the research paper.

2. **Film Properties**:
   - The schema should include properties related to the conformality and uniformity of the film, as these are key characteristics observed in the research.
   - Add properties for the dielectric constant and thermal stability, which are important for applications in semiconductor devices.

3. **Deposition Conditions**:
   - Include detailed properties related to the reactor design and the flow of gases, which are critical for achieving the desired film properties.
   - Properties related to the purge times and gas flow rates should be added, as they significantly affect the film quality.

4. **Temperature Ranges**:
   - Detailed properties for the substrate and precursor temperatures should be included, as these affect the deposition rate and film quality.

5. **Reactivity with Surfaces**:
   - Properties describing the reactivity of precursors with hydroxylated surfaces, which is a key factor in the deposition process.

6. **Film Thickness and Growth Rate**:
   - Include properties for the growth rate and thickness uniformity along the deposition zone.
