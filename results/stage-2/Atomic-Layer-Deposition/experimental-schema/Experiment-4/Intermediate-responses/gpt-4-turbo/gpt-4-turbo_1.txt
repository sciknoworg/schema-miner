Based on the detailed research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process, particularly focusing on low-temperature ALD for Al2O3 films. The research paper provides extensive data on the process parameters, film properties, and the effects of temperature, which are crucial for enhancing the schema.

### Schema Refinements and Additions:

1. **Temperature-Specific Properties**:
   - The schema should include properties specific to low-temperature operations, such as the impact on film density and hydrogen incorporation.
   - Add properties for `filmDensity` and `hydrogenConcentration` under `materialProperties`.

2. **Reactor Details**:
   - Include details about the reactor type (viscous-flow reactor) and modifications for specific substrates (e.g., PET bottles).
   - Add a new property `reactorDetails` with nested properties for `type`, `modifications`, and `purgeLine`.

3. **Film Characterization Techniques**:
   - The schema should reflect the various techniques used for film characterization such as QCM, ellipsometry, AFM, and XRR.
   - Expand `verificationMethods` under `chemicalComposition` to include these techniques.

4. **Gas Diffusion Tests**:
   - Information on gas diffusion tests and their results should be included, particularly for applications like food packaging.
   - Add a new property `gasDiffusionTests` under `otherAspects`.

5. **Cycle Time Adjustments**:
   - Reflect the dependency of cycle times on temperature, which affects the efficiency of the ALD process.
   - Add properties for `cycleTime` under `saturation` with details for each temperature.

6. **Substrate Details**:
   - Include details about substrate preparation and types used, especially for low-temperature applications.
   - Add a new property `substrateDetails` with nested properties for `type`, `preparation`, and `size`.
