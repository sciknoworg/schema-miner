Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements are necessary to better represent the ALD process for TiN films using TDMAT and NH3, as described in the research. The paper highlights several key aspects of the ALD process that are not fully captured in the current schema, particularly around the surface chemistry, growth rates, and film properties.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Surface Chemistry and Reaction Mechanism**:
   - The schema should include properties related to the surface reactions, particularly the transamination exchange reactions that are crucial in the ALD process using TDMAT and NH3.

2. **Growth Rate and Conditions**:
   - The schema should reflect the dependency of growth rate on temperature and exposure times, as well as non-ideal behaviors such as continual growth with long TDMAT exposures.

3. **Film Properties**:
   - The schema should include more detailed properties of the film, such as resistivity, porosity, and oxidation levels, which are critical for assessing the quality and applicability of the TiN films.

4. **Incorporation of Impurities**:
   - The schema should account for the potential incorporation of dimethylamino ligands into the film, which affects the film's properties.

5. **Purge Times and Gas Adsorption**:
   - Detailed properties related to purge times and the adsorption behaviors of gases (NH3) during the ALD process should be included.

This updated schema now includes more detailed properties related to the film's physical characteristics, such as resistivity and porosity, which are crucial for assessing the film's quality and functionality. It also better reflects the complex surface chemistry involved in the ALD process using TDMAT and NH3, including the impact of purge times and gas adsorption behaviors.
