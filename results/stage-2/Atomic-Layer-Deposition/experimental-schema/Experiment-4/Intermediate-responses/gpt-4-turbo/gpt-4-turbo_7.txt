Based on the research paper and the current JSON schema, the schema needs to be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the ALD process, particularly focusing on the growth mechanism, the role of temperature, and the interaction of precursors with the surface. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:

### Key Changes and Additions:
1. **Generalized Schema Title**: Changed to "Metal Oxide Films" to potentially cover more types of films beyond just Tin Oxide.
2. **Detailed Film Properties**: Added more properties related to the film's physical and chemical characteristics, which are influenced by the deposition conditions and the precursor used.
3. **Temperature-Specific Properties**: Included properties that change with temperature, reflecting the research paper's focus on the impact of temperature on growth rates and film characteristics.
4. **Reactor and Process Conditions**: Detailed the reactor design and process conditions to better capture the specifics of the ALD process as described in the research paper.

This schema now more accurately represents the detailed and variable conditions of the ALD process as described in the research paper, providing a comprehensive framework for data capture in experimental setups.
