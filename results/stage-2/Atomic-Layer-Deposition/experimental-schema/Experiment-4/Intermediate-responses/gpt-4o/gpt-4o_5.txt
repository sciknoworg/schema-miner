Based on the research paper and domain expert feedback, the following refinements have been made to the JSON schema for the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process:

1. **Incorporated New Properties**:
   - Added `porosity` under `filmProperties` to capture the porosity of the film, as the research paper highlighted its significance in TiN films.
   - Added `reactiveStickingCoefficient` under `processConditions` to capture the sticking coefficient, which is relevant for understanding the deposition process.

2. **Modified Existing Properties**:
   - Updated `reactivity` descriptions for both `precursor` and `coReactant` to include potential issues with non-ideal ALD behavior, as discussed in the paper.
   - Updated `density` under `filmProperties` to include a note about its correlation with porosity and film quality.

3. **Expert Feedback Application**:
   - Grouped related properties under `filmProperties` and `processConditions` for better organization.
   - Ensured that the schema remains general and does not include overly specific properties that could compromise its applicability across different ALD processes.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
