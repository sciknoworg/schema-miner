This paper presents the results of a study on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) films at low temperatures, specifically down to 33°C, which is significantly lower than typical ALD conditions. The authors demonstrate that Al₂O₃ ALD can be performed successfully even at such low temperatures and discuss the properties and characteristics of these low-temperature grown films.

Key findings include:

1. **Thermal Activation**: Longer reactant exposures are required due to thermal activation, as expected.
2. **Growth Rates**: Maximum growth rates occur around 100-125°C.
3. **Density**: Film densities decrease with decreasing temperature, which is lower than typical values for amorphous Al₂O₃ films.
4. **Electrical Properties**: The films exhibit good electrical properties, including low leakage currents and high dielectric constants.
5. **Gas Barrier Performance**: Low-temperature ALD coatings on PET bottles showed improved CO2 gas barrier performance compared to uncoated bottles.

The study highlights the potential for applying low-temperature ALD in coating thermally fragile substrates such as organic polymers or biological materials, which could be particularly useful in packaging applications where thermal stability is a concern. The authors also suggest that improvements in reactor design and alternative oxygen sources could further enhance the process at lower temperatures.

This research contributes to expanding the range of possible applications for ALD technology by demonstrating its viability under conditions that might not otherwise be suitable due to substrate limitations or processing constraints.
