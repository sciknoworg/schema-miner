Based on the research paper content and domain expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties, merge certain properties for better organization, and adjust descriptions for clarity and accuracy. Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes new properties such as `ALDMethod`, `materialDeposited`, `depositionTemperature`, `pressure`, `reactor`, `crystallinity`, and `filmDensity` under a new `processConditions` object. It also merges and reorganizes properties based on expert feedback to improve clarity and usability.
