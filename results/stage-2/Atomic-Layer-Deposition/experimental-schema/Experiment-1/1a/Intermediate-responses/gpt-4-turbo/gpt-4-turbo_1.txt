Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties, merge some existing properties, and reorganize the schema for better clarity and accuracy. Here is the refined JSON schema:

This schema now includes new properties such as ALD method, material deposited, deposition temperature, pressure, reactor, and crystallinity. It also merges thickness control and saturation into a single object and reorganizes the schema to better reflect the process parameters and film properties.
