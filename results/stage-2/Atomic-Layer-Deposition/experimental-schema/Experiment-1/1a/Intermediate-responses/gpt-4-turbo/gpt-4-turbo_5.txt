Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional properties and constraints, particularly focusing on the use of TDMAT and NH3 in the deposition of TiN films. The research paper highlights several key aspects of the ALD process using these materials, such as the non-ideal behavior of the ALD system, the surface chemistry involved, and the properties of the resulting TiN films.

Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating the insights from the research paper and expert feedback:
