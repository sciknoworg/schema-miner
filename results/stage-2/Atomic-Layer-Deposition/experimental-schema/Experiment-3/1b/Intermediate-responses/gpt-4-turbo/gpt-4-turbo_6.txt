Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include additional details about the deposition of tin oxide using tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin and water as the precursor and counter-reactant, respectively. The schema will also incorporate the suggested property merging, grouping, and the addition of missing properties.

Here is the refined JSON schema:
