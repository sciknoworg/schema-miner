### Changes and Additions:
1. **Precursor Details**: Added specific examples of precursors used for hafnium and zirconium oxides.
2. **Co-Reactant**: Included water as a co-reactant, as used in the research paper.
3. **Vapor Pressure**: Added a property to capture the vapor pressure of the precursor.
4. **Temperature Range**: Updated to reflect the range used in the research paper (50°C to 500°C).
5. **Dielectric Constant**: Added under electrical properties to reflect its importance in semiconductor applications.
6. **Step Coverage**: Added under conformality to reflect the 100% step coverage achieved with high aspect ratio features.
7. **Metal to Oxygen Ratio**: Added under chemical composition to specify the expected stoichiometry in the films.
8. **Material Deposited**: Updated to include HfO2 and ZrO2 as materials deposited during the ALD process.

These changes ensure the schema is comprehensive and reflects the specific conditions and outcomes detailed in the research paper for ALD of hafnium and zirconium oxides using metal amide precursors.
