Based on the research paper and expert feedback provided, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to better represent the complexities and specifics of the process, particularly focusing on the growth mechanism of titanium dioxide from TiCl4 and H2O. The research paper provides detailed insights into the growth rates, the effect of substrate temperatures, and the interaction of precursors with the surface, which are crucial for refining the schema.

### Refinements Based on Research Paper:
1. **Temperature Dependence**: The schema should explicitly include properties that capture the dependency of growth rates and other process parameters on the substrate temperature.
2. **Precursor Interaction**: The schema should detail the interaction of precursors with the surface, including the formation of intermediate species and their stability.
3. **Growth Rate**: The schema should include properties related to the growth rate, which is influenced by the temperature and the physical state of the substrate (e.g., crystalline vs. amorphous).

### Refinements Based on Expert Feedback:
1. **Reorganization**: The expert suggests a more organized structure under `ThicknessControl` and `MaterialProperties`. This involves grouping related properties under these headings.
2. **Detailed Sub-properties**: Each main property should have detailed sub-properties that capture all relevant aspects of the process, such as dosing time, purging time, saturation, nucleation period, and the ALD window under `ThicknessControl`.
