Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include specific details about the surface chemistry and film growth during TiN atomic layer deposition using TDMAT and NH3. The paper highlights several key aspects such as the non-ideal behavior of the ALD process, the importance of surface reactions, and the properties of the resulting TiN films. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these insights:

This refined schema now includes the use of TDMAT and NH3 as reactants, addresses the non-ideal behaviors observed in the ALD process, and incorporates the properties of the TiN films as discussed in the research paper.
