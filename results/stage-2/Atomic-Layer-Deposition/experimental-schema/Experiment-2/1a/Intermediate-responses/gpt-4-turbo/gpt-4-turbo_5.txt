Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements are necessary to better represent the ALD process for TiN using TDMAT and NH3, as described in the research. The paper highlights several key aspects and challenges in the process that need to be reflected in the schema, including the non-ideal behavior of the ALD process, the buildup of dimethylamino species, and the impact of various process parameters on film properties like resistivity and porosity.

### Refinements to the JSON Schema:

1. **Addition of New Properties:**
   - **Surface Chemistry Observations:** Include properties related to the buildup of dimethylamino species and the exchange reactions observed.
   - **Film Growth Observations:** Reflect the non-self-limiting growth behavior and the impact of TDMAT exposure time on growth rate.
   - **Film Properties:** Include properties related to film porosity, which significantly affects the film's effectiveness as a diffusion barrier and its resistivity.

2. **Modification of Existing Properties:**
   - **Process Parameters:** Expand to include more detailed temperature profiles and exposure times for both TDMAT and NH3, reflecting their impact on growth rates and film properties.
   - **Film Properties:** Update to include detailed descriptions of resistivity changes with temperature and the chemical composition analysis showing high oxygen levels.

3. **Enhancements for Clarity and Accuracy:**
   - **Detailed Descriptions:** Enhance property descriptions to include why each parameter or property is critical, based on the findings from the research paper.
   - **Units and Constraints:** Ensure all properties have clear units and constraints where applicable, such as temperature ranges and exposure times.
