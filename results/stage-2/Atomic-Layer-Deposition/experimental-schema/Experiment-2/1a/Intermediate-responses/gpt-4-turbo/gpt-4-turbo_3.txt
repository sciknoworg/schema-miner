Based on the provided research paper and the current JSON schema, several refinements and additions are necessary to accurately represent the ALD process for hafnium and zirconium oxides using metal amide precursors. The research paper provides detailed insights into the process parameters, precursor characteristics, and film properties that are crucial for a comprehensive schema.

### Refinements and Additions to the JSON Schema:

1. **Precursor Properties**:
   - Add properties related to the vapor pressure and reactivity of the precursors, as these are critical for understanding the deposition dynamics.
   - Include the temperature range for vaporization of the precursors, which is crucial for setting up the process.

2. **Process Parameters**:
   - Introduce properties related to the reactor design, such as dimensions and materials, which influence the deposition uniformity and efficiency.
   - Add detailed purging and flow conditions, which are essential for achieving high-quality films.

3. **Film Properties**:
   - Include detailed properties such as dielectric constants, step coverage, and deposition rates, which are important for applications in semiconductor devices.
   - Add properties related to the film's uniformity and impurity content, particularly focusing on nitrogen and carbon levels, which affect the electrical properties of the films.

4. **Temperature and Pressure Conditions**:
   - Detailed temperature profiles for both the substrate and the precursors are necessary, as they significantly affect the film quality and characteristics.
   - Include pressure conditions within the reactor during the deposition process.

5. **Reactivity with Water**:
   - Since water is used as a co-reactant, properties related to its interaction with the precursors and the resulting film characteristics should be included.
