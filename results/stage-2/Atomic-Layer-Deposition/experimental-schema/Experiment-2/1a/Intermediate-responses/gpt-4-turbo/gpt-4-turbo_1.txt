Based on the research paper and expert feedback, the JSON schema for the ALD process needs to be refined to include specific details about low-temperature ALD processes, the use of specific precursors, and the impact on film properties such as density and gas diffusion rates. Here is the refined JSON schema incorporating these aspects:

This schema now includes properties specific to low-temperature ALD processes, such as the use of specific precursors like TMA and H2O, and properties that are affected by low temperatures like film density and gas permeability. It also aligns with expert feedback to ensure a comprehensive representation of the ALD process.
