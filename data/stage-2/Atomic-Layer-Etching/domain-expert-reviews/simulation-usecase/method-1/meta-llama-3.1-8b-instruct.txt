Property Merging:
None needed or beneficial.

Property Grouping:
1. Groupings that have been given are clear and well organised but needed to be expanded, currently they focus too much on an experimental procedure.
2. The "parameters" group is taken solely from experiments. Although this might be simulated in a reactor scale investigation it will not be covered by the majority of simulation studies.
3. Simulation parameters needs to expand and then maybe be divided up depending on the size of the grouping. There should be both strings and number properties for the majority of properties, e.g. under mechanisms there will be a discussion of the mechanisms that are occurring but there will also be associated energies such as binding or dissociation energies.

Missing Properties:
1. There needs to be a clear description of the simulation methodology used, e.g. DFT with a certain functional, what convergence criteria are used, etc.
2. I think the simulation parameters (outputs) should feature both strings for written descriptions of results but also numerical properties for something like a binding energy.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Descriptions given are accurate.
2. Inclusion of units are good but they might need to be generalised to allow for differences in reporting. E.g. extract the unit that is given with pressure rather than assuming it is pascals.
