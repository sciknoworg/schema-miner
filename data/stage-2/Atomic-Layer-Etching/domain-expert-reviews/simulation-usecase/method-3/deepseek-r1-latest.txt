Property Merging:
No merging of properties needed

Property Grouping:
1. The general grouping principle is good, clearly splitting experimental from simulation and inputs from outputs (or independent/dependent variables). 
2. For the simulation use case, I think there is too much focus on experimental properties (e.g., reactor temperature/pressure). Although this may be a feature if it is a combined study, it is not the focus of a simulation-based investigation. The only really key information is the input materials, so we know what was studied.
3. I'm not sure of the distinction between simulation parameters and observables in this schema. I think parameters should refer to the input settings, and observables should refer to the outputs/results. Descriptors could also be used for results.

Missing Properties:
1. Input simulation parameters, e.g. what type of simulation is it? DFT, etc, what are the parameters/settings used for this, energy cutoffs, functionals, etc
2. Simulation results/outputs needed to be expanded into multiple properties; currently, they are very vague and non-descriptive. There should be both numerical results and text-based discussions of mechanisms, etc. Both are important to the results of the investigation.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. There shouldn't be default values for measured observables; they should just be what has been reported in the specific paper.
2. I'm not sure what the "status" property is referring to; probably unnecessary.
