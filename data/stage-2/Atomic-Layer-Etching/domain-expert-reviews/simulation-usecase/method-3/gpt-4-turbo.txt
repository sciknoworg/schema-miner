Property Merging:
None needed/useful

Property Grouping:
1. Groupings that are present are clear and sensible.
2. Heavily focused towards an experimental procedure/paper rather than a simulation paper. Needs to be tailored towards the simulation use case. For example, the outputs given are the results of an experimental procedure. In a simulation, there are not necessarily the same outputs, depending on which simulations or parts of the process have been studied.

Missing Properties:
1. There needs to be a clear description of the simulation methodology used, e.g. DFT with a certain functional, what convergence criteria are used, etc.
2. I think the simulation parameters (outputs) should feature both strings for written descriptions of results, and numerical properties for something like a binding energy.
3. There should be a description of what was being studied. For example, was it a study into the mechanism of binding of a precursor or maybe it was a continuum scale simulation to investigate the effect of gas flow in the reactor vessel?
4. A property to describe whether it was a purely simulation paper or whether it was combined with experimental efforts, and if it is combined then there needs to be clear understanding of which properties come from which type of investigation.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. The descriptions given are all accurate.
2. No units given for properties, e.g. how is pressure reported in this experiment?
