Property Merging:
No merging of properties needed.

Property Grouping:
1. Overall grouping is clear and sensible. It separates out the experimental from the simulation and mostly the input properties from the output properties.
2. There is a heavy focus towards the experimental side of ALE and very little for simulation properties. The process parameters are important to report in a combined study but they are not as important as the simulation (the main focus of the schema). This needs to be well thought through, as some properties that are currently under experimental type groupings are key for the simulations, e.g., the materials used or the energy source if excitations are being studied.

Missing Properties:
1. There needs to be a clear description of the simulation methodology used, e.g. DFT with a certain functional, what convergence criteria are used, etc.
2. I think the simulation parameters (outputs) should feature both strings for written descriptions of results but also numerical properties for something like a binding energy.
3. More focus and expansion of the simulation properties are needed, and make the process parameters an optional addition to the end of the schema, depending on the nature of the study (combined or purely simulation).

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. All of the properties defined are sensical.
2. Some numerical properties could feature a range of units, e.g. pressure may be reported in Pa, kPa, bar, etc.
