Property Grouping:
1. Include in the etchedMaterialProperties property group that I recommended to you below, the material_property_uniformity.
2. Include the material_property parameters in the etchedMarerialProperties group.
3. The composition property could be renamed to chemicalComposition which regards the chemical composition of the etched material and is included in the etchedMaterialProperties group.
4. Place the material property in the start of the schema and remove the composition property from the group.

Missing Properties:
1. Material that is etched
2. The ALE process used: is it thermal or plasma ALE?
3. The etch per cycle or EPC of the ALE process, when saturated.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Change the chemicals term in the description of the reactants parameter, to reactants. Since other reactants are also used in the process, like the purging gas, that could be confused and be used in the reactants group.
2. Remove the etch rate variability parameter in the uniformity property group
3. Rename the post_etch_surface to etchedMaterialProperties. That property group should include all the properties of the etched material obtained from further characterization of the film, like chemical composition, roughness, crystallinity etc. Mention also what characterization method was used to characterize the material.
4. Remove the definitions property group. There are parameters there that are already mention in the schema previously.
5. Remove the composition in the material group.
