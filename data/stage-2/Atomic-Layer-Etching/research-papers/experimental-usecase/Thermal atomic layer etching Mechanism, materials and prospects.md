Keywords: Thermal atomic layer etching Atomic layer deposition Self-limiting Reaction mechanism Atomic-scale precision

In the semiconductors and related industries, the fabrication of nanostructures and nanopatterns has become progressive demand for achieving near-atomic accuracy and selectivity in etching di /uniFB00 erent materials, particularly in ultra-thin gate dielectrics and ultra-thin channels used in /uniFB01 eld-e /uniFB00 ect transistors and other nanodevices below 10 nm scale. Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a novel technique for removing thin layers of material using sequential and self-limiting reactions. Di /uniFB00 erent from most ALE processes using plasma-enhanced or other energetic particles-enhanced surface reactions, thermal ALE realizes isotropic atomic-level etch control based on sequential thermal-drive reaction steps that are self-terminating and self-saturating. Thermal ALE can be viewed as the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD), both of which de /uniFB01 ne the atomic layer removal and growth steps required for advanced semiconductor fabrication. In this review, we focus on the concept and basic characteristics of the thermal ALE in comparison with ALD. Several typical thermal ALE mechanisms including /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange, conversion-etch, oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions are intensively introduced. The pros and cons of thermal ALE, plasma ALE, and traditional plasma etching are compared. Some representative materials and their typical thermal ALE processes are summarized. Finally, the outlook and challenges of thermal ALE are addressed.

## 1. Introduction

In the modern semiconductor industry, atomic-scale etching control and material selectivity are more and more important in the pattern transfer process, especially in the fabrication of nanodevices [1 -3].

As is well known, reactive ion etching is the important plasma etching with directional removal and fast etching rate by using continuous processing [4]. However, plasma etching cannot meet the requirements of the current semiconductor industry precision due to process variability, plasma-induced surface damage and unlimited reactivity [5 -7].

Recently, atomic layer etching has drawn great attention because of its advantages in atomic-scale etching. As the reverse process of atomic layer deposition (ALD) [8 -10], the earliest report on atomic layer etching (ALE) technique can be traced back to a U.S. patent in 1988 [11]. Yoder /uniFB01 rst proposed the concept of ALE to remove a single atomic layer from the surface of synthetic diamond /uniFB01 lms, which contains fourstep processes: 1. Passing NO2 to be chemically adsorbed on diamond surface; 2. Cleaning; 3. Impulsing the diamond surface with ions of mixed precious metal and hydrogen; 4. Cleaning. Maki and Ehrlich also contributed to early ALE. In 1989, they introduced Cl2 to form an

atomic-scale passivation layer of GaAs, and then the ArF laser was used to decompose the passivation layer, obtaining self-limiting etching at the atomic level [12]. Later, Si was etched using F2 or Cl2 adsorption on Si and subsequent Ar + plasma bombardment to remove the Si surface adsorption layer with an etching rate of 0.4 Å/cycle [13]. This processing can be called plasma atomic layer etching (plasma ALE), which mainly consists of two steps: the surface adsorption process and the surface removal process. Plasma chlorination is used to adsorb chloride ions on the surface of the etched materials by chlorine-based chemistry. Removal of the surface utilizes activated ions such as neutral Ar plasma beams [14] or Cl2 plasma [15] to bombard the surface of the materials adsorption layer, so as to achieve atomic level etching.

At the turn of the 21st century, the development of ALE was relatively slow compared to thriving ALD, because of its slow etching rate and long processing time. However, in recent years in order to reduce the size of logic components, the integration of semiconductor devices to sub-10 nm technology nodes requires urgently atomic scale controllability (&lt;0.5 nm) and selectivity using layer-by-layer etch processes for microelectronics industry. Traditional plasma or wet etching processes fail to meet such harsh demands in such thin-layer architectures, especially high conformality.

Recently, thermal ALE method was /uniFB01 rst reported by George's group in the University of Colorado in 2015 [16]. Unlike the anisotropic plasma ALE, the thermal ALE is etched isotropically by using thermaldrive sequential and self-limiting reactions and can be regarded as the inverse of ALD process [8 -10]. The combination of ALD and ALE can de /uniFB01 ne the atomic layer growth and removal required for advanced semiconductor fabrication, producing ultrasmooth thin /uniFB01 lms based on deposit/etch-back methods and conformal etching in high-aspect-ratio structures [17]. The etching accuracy reaches atomic-scale dimensions, and a large area of uniform etching surface can be obtained. At the same time, the thermal ALE can also be selectively etched according to the speci /uniFB01 c radicals or ions process. Because of the above advantages, thermal ALE is triggering tremendous research interests in searching for the most applicable etching materials, processing approach and etching mechanism.

In this review, we focus on the concept and basic characteristics of the thermal ALE in comparison with ALD. Several typical thermal ALE mechanisms including /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange, conversionetch, oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions are highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of thermal ALE, plasma ALE, and plasma etching are compared. The representative materials and their typical thermal ALE processes are summarized. This overview also discusses the prospects and challenges of thermal ALE.

## 2. Concept and reaction mechanisms of thermal ALE

products by introducing proper precursor, di /uniFB00 erent from ALD. Each thermal ALE cycle can also be divided into four steps, corresponding to the ALD cycle (Fig. 1(b)): (I) surface adsorption; (II) excess reactant evacuation; (III) surface removal and (IV) volatile reaction products evacuation. The I and III steps are the key surface self-limiting steps. The II and IV steps are velocity-limited evacuation steps, which depend on the residence time of reactants and products in the reaction chamber.

At the same time, according to the growth rate in ALD (growth per cycle, GPC), the etching rate (or depth) of each cycle can also be de/uniFB01 ned as EPC (etch per cycle) in thermal ALE. Due to the nature of the self-limiting reaction during thermal ALE, EPC keeps constant, which does not change with the etching process parameters when the etching process parameters such as precursor exposure time or reactant pressure attain certain critical value. Correspondingly, there is also the concept of thermal ALE window in atomic layer etching. However, ALD window is not an essential requirement. For most thermal ALE reported up to date, EPC is evidently temperature-dependent, but in few thermal ALE reactions such as removal of TiN, HfO2 and TiO2, ALE window has been observed [20 -22].

For the thermal ALE process, it is the separated half-reaction that helps to remove the interaction between the surface modi /uniFB01 cation A and the surface removal B, control the order of surface reactions, make selflimiting behavior possible, and open the thermal ALE window. That is, "discontinuity" avoids the formation of thick mixed layers and the resulting unrestricted reactivity in continuous plasma etching [23].

Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is a technique that uses a sequence of self-limiting reactions for thin /uniFB01 lm etching. Similar to the concept of layer-by-layer growth of atomic layer deposition (ALD) [8], thermal ALE leads to the layer-by-layer removal of materials [14,18,19]. Fig. 1 shows schematics of one complete thermal ALE and ALD cycle. A typical thermal ALE cycle usually consists of two halfreactions: surface modi /uniFB01 cation (half-reaction A) and surface removal (half-reaction B) in Fig. 1(a). Surface modi /uniFB01 cation A refers to that a surface chemisorption layer is formed on the etched surface via precursor vapor self-limiting adsorption, similar to ALD. Surface removal B is that the surface chemisorption layer is converted to volatile etching

The chemistry of thermal ALE based on sequential /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions has been investigated /uniFB01 rstly [17]. It can be used to etch several metal oxides, metal nitride, metal /uniFB02 uoride, etc. In order to broaden the choice of etched materials and types, some new strategies in thermal ALE have also been developed based on ' conversion-etch ' and ' oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions ' mechanisms to etch SiO2 [24], TiN [20], WO3 and metal W [25]. Next, the representative reaction mechanisms of thermal ALE will be elaborated, respectively.

## 2.1. Fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions

Fig. 2 shows the proposed reaction mechanism for thermal ALE Al2O3 thin /uniFB01 lms using HF and trimethylaluminum (Al(CH3)3, TMA) as reactants [26]. Al2O3 thermal ALE is achieved by sequential, self-limiting reactions of /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange using an AB exposure sequence. The overall reaction can be expressed as [26]:

$$\text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } \left ( s \right ) \, + \, 6 \text{HF} ( g ) \, + \, 4 \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \left ( g \right ) \rightarrow 6 \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } \left ( g \right ) \, + \, 3 \text{H} _ { 2 } O \left ( g \right ) \, \text{pertur} \, \\ \text{(1)} \, \text{ at 300} \, ^ { \circ }$$

This overall reaction can be divided into two half-reaction A and B:

Fluorination A: Al2O3 /uniFE31 Al2O3 * (s) + 6HF (g) → Al2O3 /uniFE31 2AlF3 * (s) +3H2O (g) (2)

Ligand-exchange B: Al2O3 /uniFE31 2AlF3 * (s) +4Al(CH3)3 (g) → Al2O3 * (s) +6AlF(CH3)2 (g) (3)

The tin (II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2) and HF instead of TMA and HF can also be used for thermal ALE Al2O3 /uniFB01 lms at temperatures from 150 to 250 °C [16]. The etched surface becomes very smooth with surface roughness of only 2 3 Å -(original RMS (root-mean-square) value of ~ 5 Å). The schematic for the proposed surface chemistry of thermal ALE Al2O3 is displayed in Fig. 3 [16]. The overall reaction can be written as [16]:

Al2O3 (s) /uniFF0B 6HF (g) + 6Sn(acac)2 (g) → 2Al(acac)3 (g) + 6SnF(acac) (g) + 3H2O(g) (4)

This overall reaction can be separated into Sn(acac)2 and HF reactions:

Ligand-exchange A: Al2O3 /uniFE31 2AlF3* (s)+ 6Sn(acac)2 (g) → Al2O3 /uniFE31 xSnF (acac)* (s) + 2Al(acac)3 (g) + (6-x)SnF(acac) (g) (5)

Fluorination B: Al2O3 /uniFE31 xSnF(acac)* (s) + 6HF (g) → 2AlF3* (s) + xSnF (acac) (g) + 3H2O (g) (6)

Whether TMA/HF or Sn(acac)2/HF are used as the reactants, the etching process can be divided into four steps: I/uniFB02 uorination, HF reactant is transferred into the reactor and reacts with Al2O3 surface to form AlF3; II-purge, inert purge gas is introduced to remove excess HF and gaseous by-products such as H2O, CH4 or SnF(acac); III-ligand exchange, TMA or Sn(acac)2 reactant is introduced and etch happens if ligand-exchange convert AlF3 surface layer to a stable and volatile reaction product; IV-purge, excess reactant of TMA or Sn(acac)2 and volatile etch products, such as AlF(CH3)2, Al(acac)3, and SnF(acac), are removed.

Ligand-exchange reactions during thermal ALE are related to metalexchange transmetalation or redistribution reactions [26,27]. Fig. 2(b) shows the four-center ring transition state in the ligand-exchange reaction during ALE Al2O3, which is formed by adjacent metal centers of Al in TMA and Al in AlF3 through a bridge between F ligand and CH3 ligand [17]. Fluorine facilitates the four-center ring transition state because of its ability to form bimetallic bridges [26,28].

Fig. 4 illustrates the impact of reactant exposure time and temperature on the sample mass change during thermal ALE Al2O3 thin /uniFB01 lms using TMA and HF measured by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) [28]. At 300 °C, nearly self-limiting etching behavior is observed after 2.0 s TMA exposure when using various TMA exposure time with a 1.0 s HF pulse and constant 30 s N2 purge pulse in Fig. 4 (I-a). The halfreaction of ligand-exchange tends to be saturated with the etched AlF3 surface layer of Δ MTMA = -29 ng/cm 2 per cycle. When the TMA pulse and N2 purge pulse is /uniFB01 xed at 2.0 s and 30 s, respectively, the dependence of △ MHF of HF exposure time indicates that the nearly selflimiting adsorption characteristics are con /uniFB01 rmed after 1.0 s HF exposure due to the saturated /uniFB02 uorination reaction (Fig. 4 (I-b)). The AlF3 layer with about Δ MTMA =13ng/cm 2 per cycle is formed, which passivates the underlying Al2O3 /uniFB01 lm.

In addition, the sample mass change vs Al2O3 /uniFB01 lm etching rate is signi /uniFB01 cantly dependent on the reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 4 (II-b) [28]. With increasing the temperature, the mass loss of Δ MTMA in the TMA half-reaction becomes large obviously, and meanwhile the mass gain of Δ MHF in the HF half-reaction also shows an increasing trend. Considering the two factors, the larger mass loss of Δ MTMA in the TMA half-reaction than mass gain of Δ MHF in the HF half-reaction correspondingly leads to the increase of the etching rate with temperature. The etch rate of Al2O3 is 0.14 Å/cycle at 250 °C, 0.51 Å/cycle at 300 °C, and 0.75 Å/cycle at 325 °C, respectively. These data reveal that only 19% of AlF3 is removed at 250 °C and about 75% of AlF3 is etched at 325 °C. At di /uniFB00 erent temperatures, the etching depth is linear with the number of ALE cycles.

At present, besides Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, AlN, and AlF3 have been successfully etched using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions [21,29 -31]. Most thermal ALE processes are strongly temperature-dependent, except HfO2 ALE with an ALE window ranging from 200 °C to 250 °C [21]. Selectivity in thermal ALE of Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, Si3N4 and TiN based on /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions has been con /uniFB01 rmed using Sn(acac)2, TMA, Al(CH3)2Cl, and SiCl4 as the metal precursors and HF-pyridine as the /uniFB02 uorination agent, as illustrated in Fig. 5 [29]. HfO2 can be etched by all of the metal precursors. Al2O3 and ZrO2 can be etched by all of the metal precursors except SiCl4 and TMA. On the contrary, SiO2, Si3N4, and TiN cannot be etched by any of the metal precursors. Selective etching is related to the stability and volatility of possible reaction products. For example, SiO2 and Si3N4 cannot be etched by this process because on one hand neither SiO2 nor Si3N4 is etched spontaneously by HF in absence of H2O [29,32], on the other hand the Si-F bond is too strong to undergo an e /uniFB00 ective ligand exchange reaction to generate Si-containing volatiles [30]. The negligible etching of TiN is ascribed to either the absence of stable or volatile Ti (III) reaction products or the di /uniFB03 culty of /uniFB02 uorinating Ti (IV) surface species using HF [29].

Therefore, on the basis of /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions, George's group has extended the new etching mechanisms of ' conversion-etch ' such as ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidationconversion/uniFB02 uorination ' so as to etch more materials such as SiO2 [24], ZnO [33], WO3 and W [25] by thermal ALE. It will be addressed in next section.

## 2.2. Conversion-etch

conversion step from SiO2 to Al2O3 can be achieved by introducing TMA reactant at higher reactant pressures:

As mentioned above, SiO2 cannot be etched by /uniFB02 uorination and ligand exchange reactions using TMA and HF reactants at 300 °C with lower reactant pressure of 0.08 Torr [29], nevertheless through the conversion-etch method, thermal ALE SiO2 thin /uniFB01 lms have been realized using an AB exposure sequence of TMA and HF at 300 °C with higher precursor pressure of 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0 Torr [24]. The key

Conversion: 3 SiO2 (s) + 4 Al(CH3)3(g) → 2 Al2O3 (s) + 3 Si(CH3)4 (g) Δ G = -235·0 kcal/mol at 300 °C (7)

Then the following process is similar to Al2O3 /uniFB01 lm etching in /uniFB02 uorination and ligand exchange [26]. The schematic of conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions of thermal ALE SiO2 using TMA/HF is shown in

Fig. 5. Selective etching of Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, Si3N4, and TiN by themal ALE using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions: (a) Sn(acac)2 at 200 °C and (b) TMA at 300 °C. Reproduced from Ref. [29].

Fig. 6. The conversion reaction from SiO2 to Al2O3 is spontaneous because of a large negative value of Δ G. First, SiO2 is converted to Al2O3/ Al-silicate intermediate after TMA exposure. The following HF exposure can /uniFB02 uorinate Al2O3/Al-silicate into AlF3 and SiOxFy. Subsequently, the next TMA exposure can remove AlF3 and SiOxFy by a ligand exchange transmetalation reactions and then convert additional SiO2 to Al2O3 again. Continuous TMA and HF reactions result in SiO2 ALE, and each TMA/HF reaction is self-limiting behavior. The SiO2 etching rate is dependent on static reactant pressures, such as 0.027, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.31 Å/cycle at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0 Torr, respectively [24]. The larger etching rates at higher reactant pressures suggest a pressure-dependent reaction mechanism for SiO2 ALE.

Similar conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions can be observed in thermal ALE of ZnO thin /uniFB01 lms utilizing TMA and HF [33], as shown in Fig. 7. The conversion reaction (Eq. (8)) from ZnO to Al2O3 is also spontaneous by TMA treatment. The EPC (etch per cycle) is temperature-dependent with 2.11 Å/cycle at 265 °C, which is much higher than thermal ALE of other oxide materials such as Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, and ZrO2. And the etched surface becomes smooth with the decreased RMS value from 11 Å to 5.8 Å.

Conversion: 3ZnO (s) + 2 Al(CH3)3 (g) → Al2O3 (s) + 3 Zn(CH3)2 (g) Δ G = -166·8 kcal/mol at 265 °C (8)

Above all, in the conversion-etch procedure, the etched surface layer is converted to a di /uniFB00 erent material such as Al2O3 by TMA. Al2O3 can easily be /uniFB02 uorinated by HF and removed by ligand-exchange. Therefore, conversion-etch approaches may provide alternative pathways for etching additional materials with volatile /uniFB02 uorides using thermal ALE.

For example, such conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions can also be expected in thermal ALE SnO2, In2O3 and Si3N4 using TMA and HF, because the TMA reactant converts them into more stable Al2O3 or AlN and volatile organometallic compounds such as Sn(CH3)2, In(CH3)3, and Si(CH3)4 with thermochemically favorable Δ G values [24]. Al2O3 can easily be etched by a variety of /uniFB02 uorine precursors, such as HF and SF4, and metal precursors, such as Sn(acac)2 and TMA [16,26,29]. AlN can be etched using sequential HF and Sn(acac)2 exposures [30]. Therefore, the conversion-etch mechanism may be very useful in thermal ALE.

Apart from TMA, BCl3 can also be used in conversion reactions as the reactant. BCl3 can turn many metal oxides into B2O3, which easily forms volatile BF3 and H2O after HF exposures. WO3 cannot be etched by /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions due to the formation of volatile /uniFB02 uorides causing spontaneous etching, but it could be successfully etched using an AB exposure sequence with BCl3 and HF as the reactants via thermal ALE [25]. The conversion reaction from WO3 to B2O3 with BCl3 is thermodynamically favorable with Δ G° of -7.8 kcal/ mol at 200 °C, producing volatile WO2Cl2. B2O3 layer on WO3 surface is formed to impede further reaction of BCl3 and WO3, indicating the selflimiting behavior. Then B2O3 is spontaneously /uniFB02 uorinated and removed with HF to generate volatile BF3 and H2O, while the underlying WO3 /uniFB01 lms act as an etch stop because HF does not react with WO3 based on their positive standard free energy change ( Δ G°).

Parsons's group reported the self-limiting thermal ALE of TiO2 using WF6 and BCl3 based on similar and more complicated conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions at low temperature [22], a higher EPC of ∼ 0.6 Å/cycle at 170 °C was achieved, twice GPC of ALD TiO2. Moreover this ALE process is evidently selective for etching TiO2 over Al2O3.

The above ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism of thermal ALE WO3 using BCl3 and HF reactants can be further extended to ' oxidationconversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism for etching metal W using O2/O3, BCl3 and HF, as presented in Fig. 8 [25]. The main di /uniFB00 erence between ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' using AB cycle mode and ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' using ABC cycle mode lies in the introduction of oxygen or ozone, which oxidizes the metal W surface to a WO3 layer. Then WO3 layer is etched by BCl3 and HF with similar reaction procedure. The EPC of WO3 is temperature-dependent with 0.55 Å/cycle at 128 °C and 4.19 Å/cycle at 207 °C, while the EPC of W is ∼ 2.5 Å/cycle at 207 °C [25]. The residual WO3 layer ( ∼ 20 Å) after thermal ALE W

can be removed with BCl3 and HF without in /uniFB02 uence on the metal W layer.

Besides WO3, the conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions using BCl3 and HF can be employed to etch many metal oxides such as MoO3, VO2, V2O5, Ta2O5, GeO2, As2O3, Sb2O3, Fe2O3, SnO2, HfO2, ZrO2 and NbO2 [25]. They can be converted to B2O3 by BCl3 and possess volatile metal chlorides and metal oxychlorides. Moreover, in addition to metal W, the oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions using O2/O3, BCl3 and HF can also be applied to etch some metal materials such as Ta, Nb, V, W, Mo, and Cr. Overall, the conversion-etch including ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' will be especially useful to enable ALE pathways for metals and metal oxides that have volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides and oxychlorides.

## 2.3. Oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination

Fig. 9. Schematic for TiN ALE using O3 and HF as the reactants. Reproduced from Ref. [20].

In this section, we will focus on another valuable thermal ALE mechanism based on sequential, self-limiting oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. Fig. 9 displays the schematic of TiN ALE using O3 and HF as

Fig. 8. Schematic of proposed reaction mechanism for thermal ALE W thin /uniFB01 lm using using O2/O3, BCl3 and HF: (a) oxidation of W using O2/O3, (b) conversion of WO3 to B2O3 using BCl3 with volatile WOxCly, and (c) /uniFB02 uorination of B2O3 by HF to form volatile BF3 and H2O. Reproduced from Ref. [25].

the reactants [20].

The overall etching reaction can be expressed as:

TiN (s) + 3 O3 (g) + 4 HF (g) → TiF4 (g) + NO (g) + 3 O2 (g) + 2H2O (g) (9)

This overall reaction can be separated into O3 and HF reactions:

Oxidation: TiN (s) + 3 O3 (g) → TiO2 (s) + NO (g) + 3 O2 (g) (10)

$$\text{Fluorination: TiO} _ { 2 } \left ( s \right ) \, + \, 4 \, H \left ( g \right ) \rightarrow \text{TiF} _ { 4 } \left ( g \right ) \, + \, 2 H _ { 2 } O \left ( g \right ) \quad \left ( 1 1 \right ) \, \stackrel { \text{catts} } { \dots \cdots \cdot \cdot }$$

In the proposed reaction mechanism, the strong oxidant (O3) oxidizes TiN from Ti +3 to Ti +4 and forms a stable and self-passivation TiO2 layer on the TiN substrate, which is thermodynamically favorable [20]. Herein, TiO2 layer as a di /uniFB00 usion barrier prevents further oxidation, showing a self-limiting oxidation reaction. The standard free energy change Δ G° values for the HF reaction with TiO2 is -6.1 kcal/mol at room temperature, however it becomes positive ( Δ G° = +6.1 kcal/ mol) at 250 °C due to the entropic reason, indicating thermodynamically unfavorable [20]. In fact, under nonstandard conditions, the Δ G value for /uniFB02 uorination reaction may be negative and the etching could be continued in excess of HF vapor because the products of TiF4 and H2O are rapidly evacuated by N2 purge gas. The EPC of ALE TiN increases from 0.06 Å/cycle at 150 °C to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 °C, which con /uniFB01 rms the speculation. Moreover, there exists ALE window for TiN ALE between 250 °C and 350 °C with nearly constant EPC value [20]. In addition, H2O2 can also be used as oxidation reactant to etch TiN, leading to similar surface smoothing after thermal ALE.

The selective etching of TiN is observed using O3 and HF as the reactants in the presence of other surrounding materials, including Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and Si3N4, as seen in Fig. 10 [20]. Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and Si3N4 show negligible thickness change, indicating that they cannot be etched because their /uniFB02 uorides are stable and nonvolatile such as AlF3, HfF4, and ZrF4, or their /uniFB02 uorides cannot be obtained in dry HF such as SiO2, and Si3N4.

Similarly, two-step thermal ALE of W has been demonstrated based on sequential, self-limiting oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions using O2/O3 and WF6 as the reactants [34].

This etching reaction can be divided into O2 and WF6 reactions:

The O2/WF6 process is strongly temperature dependent. The EPC is only 0.34 Å/cycle at 220 °C but increases to ∼ 6.3 Å/cycle at 300 °C,

which is attributed to the limited volatility of the WO2F2 etch product at temperatures &lt; 275 °C [34].

This thermal ALE using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination mechanism should also be applicable to metal carbides, metal sul /uniFB01 des, metal selenides, and elemental metals that have volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides and oxy /uniFB02 uorides, which expands the number of materials that can be etched by thermal ALE methods.

Table 1 summarizes several typical thermal ALE mechanisms, reactants, etched materials and requirements. These mechanisms are valuable to clarify the understanding of ALE reactions and expand the base of available ALE processes for advanced material processing. It is expected that the multiple pathways for selective thermal ALE can be achieved by choosing proper metal precursors with various ligands and appropriate processing temperatures.

## 3. Basic characteristics of thermal ALE

Table 2 summaries the advantages and disadvantages of thermal ALE in comparison with plasma ALE and traditional plasma etching processes.

Herein the plasma etching mainly refers to traditional dry reactive ion etching, which continuously uses chemically reactive plasma to remove the /uniFB01 lms on wafer surface. It has the advantages of fast etching rate, high throughput, anisotropic etch capability, and wide processing temperature range. However, the principal problem is that continuous plasma etching cannot meet the increasing demands of microelectronics industry on processing accuracy of nanodevices. At present, the technology node of semiconductor processing has approached the critical scale of 10 nm, and the requirements of precision control are less than 0.5 nm. No matter what thermal ALE or plasma ALE has sequential, selflimiting reaction characteristics, they enable the possible applications in atomic-scale etching with high precision. Moreover thermal ALE can avoid the surface lattice damage and charge defects caused by plasma etching with energetic ions, thereby enhancing the reliability of nanodevices.

## 4. Etched materials by thermal ALE

Table 3 summarizes the typical thermal ALE processes of some representative materials, mainly involving the /uniFB02 uorination and ligandexchange, conversion-etch, and oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination mechanisms with sequential and self-limiting behavior. Since thermal ALE processing appeared in 2015, at present some etching experiments mainly concentrate on oxides, including Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, ZnO, TiO2, SiO2, WO3 et al., among which thermal ALE of ZnO [33], TiO2 [22], SiO2 [21], and WO3 [23] uses the conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions instead of the /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions.

W Metal is commonly applied in integrated circuits as an interconnect layer and di /uniFB00 usion barrier [35], so W etching processes with atomic-layer dimension are very important in micro-nano device fabrications. One AB sequence [34] and one ABC sequence [23] thermal ALE W processes have been reported based on oxidation/uniFB02 uorination and oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination reactions, respectively. They both /uniFB01 rst convert metal W to WO3 by oxygen or ozone. Similar processing should be applicable to elemental metals such as Mo, Ta and Nb.

TiN is also a valuable material as a gate electrode for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and a copper di /uniFB00 usion barrier in semiconductor devices [36]. Similarly, TiN is /uniFB01 rst oxidized to form TiO2, and then TiO2 is /uniFB02 uorinated by HF and removed as volatile TiF4 using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. Thermal ALE of AlN can be realized by /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange using HF and Sn (acac)2 [30]. It is found that adding H2 or Ar plasma exposure after each Sn(acac)2 exposure dramatically increases the AlN EPC form 0.36 Å/ cycle to 1.96 or 0.66 Å/cycle. This enhancement can be ascribed to the removal or desorption of acac surface species limiting the AlN etch rate [30]. Finally, AlF3 ALE is the /uniFB01 rst example of the thermal ALE of a

In summary, compared to plentiful materials prepared by ALD, now the materials etched by thermal ALE are very limited by actual veri /uniFB01 cation. But it is believed that thermal ALE of more materials with atomic-scale precision will be achieved by designing feasible reaction routes and choosing proper precursors.

## 5. Prospects and challenges

Rapid progress is made on the atomic layer etching technology with self-limiting characteristics and atomic-scale control precision, which has great potential applications in microelectronics, optoelectronics, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology /uniFB01 elds, especially in semiconductor nanodevices. Ultra-thin gate dielectrics, ultra-thin channels, novel /uniFB01 eld-e /uniFB00 ect transistors (FET) architecture such as /uniFB01 n /uniFB01 eld-e /uniFB00 ect transistors (FinFET) and Gate-All-Around CMOS require near-atomic scale etching control and selectivity. Compared with the continuous plasma etching developed for more than 30 years, only atomic layer etching can meet such harsh requirements. In several material systems, thermal ALE has been con /uniFB01 rmed to obtain controllable and conformal surface etching with sub-nanometer scale, ultra-smooth surface, no damage in high aspect-ratio structures, and possible anisotropic etching with ion or radical enhancement. As an essential counterpart to ALD, ALE and ALD can enable the atomic layer growth and removal steps for advanced semiconductor fabrication, providing new processing capabilities for constructing three-dimensional nanodevices.

Although thermal ALE has achieved exciting and promising progress recently, compared to extensive and intensive ALD research, thermal ALE is still in an early stage of development. The ALE precursor and materials have yet to be enriched greatly, and the reaction mechanism needs to be further revealed. The low etching rate, long cycling time, low throughput and high cost lead to the di /uniFB03 culty for transferring thermal ALE from research to manufacturing, impeding its commercial applications in industry.

When IC critical dimension and feature size shrink below 10 nm, the low etching rate of ALE becomes relatively less crucial. The quality and smoothness of etched surface and subsurface, etching /uniFB01 delity in high aspect-ratio structures, and high materials selectivity become more and more important. This provides an alternative approach for thermal ALE to /uniFB01 nd the way in future semiconductor manufacturing processes. Above all, at the tipping point the development of thermal ALE is facing tremendous opportunities and challenges ahead. It is believed that emerging thermal ALE could have promising futures and prospects like ALD through continuous e /uniFB00 orts of academia and industry.
