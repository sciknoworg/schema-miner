ABSTRACT: Trimethylaluminum (TMA, Al(CH3)3) was used as the metal precursor, together with HF, for the atomic layer etching (ALE) of Al2 O3 using sequential, self-limiting thermal reactions. Al2 O3 ALE using TMA demonstrates that other metal precursors, in addition to Sn(acac)2 , can be employed for Al2 O3 ALE. The use of TMA for Al2O3 ALE is especially interesting because TMA can also be used for Al O 2 3 atomic layer deposition (ALD). Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) experiments monitored Al2O3 ALE at temperatures from 250 to 325 ° C. The Al2O3 ALE was linear versus the number of HF and TMA reaction cycles. The QCM studies showed that the sequential HF and TMA reactions were self-

limiting versus reactant exposure. The Al O 2 3 etching rates increased at higher temperatures. The QCM analysis measured mass change per cycle (MCPC) values that varied from -4.2 ng/(cm 2 cycle) at 250 ° C to -23.3 ng/(cm 2 cycle) at 325 ° C. These MCPCs correspond to Al2O3 etch rates from 0.14 Å/cycle at 250 ° C to 0.75 Å/cycle at 325 ° C. X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity and spectroscopic ellipsometry analyses con /uniFB01 rmed the linear removal of Al2 O3 and etching rates. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements monitored Al2O3 ALE by observing the loss of infrared absorbance from Al -O stretching vibrations. Surface intermediates were also identi /uniFB01 ed after the HF and TMA exposures. Al2O3 ALE with TMA is believed to occur by the reaction Al2 O3 + 4Al(CH3)3 + 6HF → 6AlF(CH3)2 + 3H2O. The proposed mechanism involves /uniFB02 uorination and ligandexchange reactions. The HF exposure /uniFB02 uorinates the Al O3 2 and forms an AlF3 surface layer and H2O as a volatile reaction product. During the ligand-exchange transmetalation reaction, TMA accepts F from the AlF 3 surface layer and donates CH 3 to produce volatile AlF(CH3)2 reaction products. The QCM measurements were consistent with an AlF3 surface layer thickness of 3.0 Å on Al2 O3 after the HF exposures. The larger etch rates at higher temperatures were attributed to the removal of a larger fraction of the AlF 3 surface layer by TMA exposures at higher temperatures.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic layer etching (ALE) involves the removal of thin /uniFB01 lms based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. 1,2 ALE is the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). 3,4 Atomic layer processes, such as ALE and ALD, are crucial to engineer /uniFB01 lm thicknesses with atomic scale precision and to build nanoscale semiconductor devices. 1,2 Most of the reported ALE processes to date have used halogenation reactions followed by energetic ion or noble gas atom bombardment to etch the material. 1,5,6 The use of energetic ions or atoms for etching is useful to achieve anisotropic etching. 1,2 In contrast, thermal ALE processes enable conformal and isotropic etching of threedimensional structures. 2 Thermal ALE may also achieve etching without damaging the underlying /uniFB01 lm.

good metal precursor for the ligand-exchange reaction. The ligand-exchange reaction can be characterized as a metal exchange transmetalation 11 or a redistribution 12 reaction. In the ligand-exchange reaction, ligands are transferred between adjacent metal centers. 13 The transition state is generally believed to be a four-center ring based on a variety of transmetalation reaction studies, such as Stille cross-coupling between Pd and organotin compounds. 13 For thermal ALE, the four-center ring would be formed by the metal in the metal precursor and the metal in the metal /uniFB02 uoride with /uniFB02 uorine and ligand bridging species. Fluorine facilitates the four-center ring transition state because of its ability to form bimetallic bridges. 14

Thermal ALE processes have been developed only recently. The /uniFB01 rst reported thermal ALE system was Al2O3 ALE using HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. 7,8 Subsequently, HfO2 ALE 9 and AlF3 ALE 10 were also demonstrated using HF and Sn(acac)2. The chemistry of thermal ALE is based on /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. Sn(acac)2 is a

transfer to the most electropositive atom during transmetalation. 13 Sn(II) compounds with SnX2 stoichiometry like Sn(acac)2 are good candidates for transmetalation. 15,16 Sn has a medium electronegativity of 1.8. Sn(II) complexes with SnX2 stoichiometry also have an empty 5p orbital and an unshared 5s electron pair. 17,18 The empty 5p orbital and unshared 5s electron pair yield Lewis acid and Lewis base properties that give chemical versatility to Sn(acac)2 . Sn also can form relatively strong bonds with /uniFB02 uorine. 18

Other metal precursors may also display favorable properties for the ligand-exchange reaction. Another promising metal precursor is trimethylaluminum (TMA). TMA has an open outer shell and is a strong Lewis acid because Al has only three valence electrons and does not obey the octet rule. Al has a low electronegativity of 1.5. Al is also known to form strong bonds with /uniFB02 uorine. 19 TMA is a popular reactant resulting from its high volatility and excellent reactivity. For example, sequential TMA and H2O exposures are well-known to form Al2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms. 20 The use of TMA for Al2 O3 ALE is particularly intriguing because TMA could serve to either grow Al2O3 by ALD or etch Al2O3 by ALE depending on the other reactant used together with TMA.

The use of di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors for thermal ALE could also lead to selective ALE. Di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors introduce various ligands that may transfer during the ligand-exchange transmetalation reaction. If the transferred ligand produces a metal product that is stable and volatile, then the metal product may leave the surface and produce etching. If the possible metal product is not stable or volatile, then the ligand-exchange reaction may not occur or may not produce a volatile etch product. In the previous work using Sn(acac)2 as the metal precursor for ligand-exchange, Sn(acac)2 transferred acac ligands to produce stable and volatile Al and Hf reaction products. 7 -10 In comparison, TMA can transfer CH3 ligands that may lead to reaction products with di /uniFB00 erent stabilities and volatilities that may provide for selective ALE.

In this paper, sequential exposures of HF and TMA were employed for thermal Al2 O3 ALE. The etching rates and individual HF and TMA reactions during thermal Al2O3 ALE were examined using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies. The Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus number of sequential HF and TMA exposures were also measured using X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity (XRR) and spectroscopic ellipsometry analyses. In addition, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were used to observe the loss of infrared absorbance from Al -O stretching vibrations and monitor the surface species during the sequential HF and TMA exposures. These studies demonstrate that other metal precursors, in addition to Sn(acac) , can be employed for the ligand-exchange 2 reactions in thermal ALE.

## II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

II.A. In situ QCM Studies in Viscous Flow Reactor. The ALE reactions were performed in a viscous /uniFB02 ow, hot wall ALD reactor. 21 An in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was mounted inside of the isothermal, hot wall ALD reactor. The quartz crystal (gold coated and polished, RC-cut 6 MHz, Colnatec) was placed in a sensor housing (BSH-150, In /uniFB01 con). This sensor housing was then sealed with high temperature epoxy (Epo-Tek H21D, Epoxy technology). The mass changes during the ALE reactions were recorded by a thin /uniFB01 lm deposition monitor (Maxtek TM-400, In /uniFB01 con). A proportionalintegral-derivative (PID) temperature controller (2604, Eurotherm) maintained the reaction temperature at 250, 275, 300, and 325 ° C. The temperature was controlled to within ± 0.04 ° C of the exact set point. This temperature stability was important for accurate QCM measurements. The change of the reaction temperature required more than 2 h of stabilization. A capacitance manometer (Baratron 121A, MKS) monitored the pressure in the reactor.

The Al2O3 /uniFB01 lms were grown on the QCM crystal with Al2O3 ALD using TMA (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) and H2O (Chromasolv for HPLC, Sigma-Aldrich). The Al2O3 ALE reactions were accomplished using sequential exposures of TMA and HF derived from HF-pyridine (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich). HF-pyridine is a liquid and HF gas has a vapor pressure of 90 -100 Torr over the HF-pyridine solution at room temperature. 9 The pyridine partial pressure is negligible. 22 The use of gaseous HF from the HF-pyridine solution allows for the safe handling of anhydrous HF. HF-pyridine was transferred to a gold-plated stainless steel bubbler using a dry N 2 /uniFB01 lled glovebag. The HF-pyridine, TMA, and H2O precursors were at room temperature.

A constant /uniFB02 ow of 150 sccm of ultra high purity (UHP) N 2 gas was delivered into the reactor using mass /uniFB02 ow controllers (Type 1179A, MKS). An additional /uniFB02 ow of 20 sccm of N2 gas through a metering bellows-sealed valve (SS-4BMG, Swagelok) prevented deposition on the backside of the QCM crystal. 21 The total N2 gas /uniFB02 ow of 170 sccm produced a base pressure of ∼ 1 Torr in the reactor pumped by a mechanical pump (Pascal 2015SD, Alcatel).

II.B. Si Wafers, X-ray Re /uniFB02 ectivity, Spectroscopic Ellipsometry and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were grown on boron-doped Si(100) wafers (p-type, Silicon Valley Microelectronics). These Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were used as the substrates for the ALE reactions. The bare Si substrates were cut into samples with dimensions of 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm before the Al2O3 ALD.

The ex situ X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity (XRR) scans were measured by a high resolution X-ray di /uniFB00 ractometer (Bede D1, Jordan Valley Semiconductors) using Cu K α ( λ = 1.540 Å) radiation. The /uniFB01 lament voltage and current in the X-ray tube were 40 kV and 35 mA, respectively. A 10 arcsec step size and a 5 s acquisition time were used for recording all XRR scans with a range of 300 to 6000 arcsec. The analysis software (Bede REFS, Jordan Valley Semiconductors) determined /uniFB01 lm thickness, /uniFB01 lm density and surface roughness by /uniFB01 tting the XRR scans.

Ellipsometry was performed using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (M2000, J. A. Woollam) with a spectral range of 240 to 1700 nm and an incidence angle of 75 ° . The analysis software (CompleteEASE, J. A. Woollam) /uniFB01 tted the Ψ and Δ values based on a Sellmeier model to determine the thicknesses and refractive index of the /uniFB01 lm. 23 The /uniFB01 lm composition was con /uniFB01 rmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS instrument (PHI 5600) was equipped with a monochromatic Al K α X-ray source.

II.C. In situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Studies. The in situ FTIR spectroscopy studies were performed in a reactor equipped with an FTIR spectrometer. 24 The FTIR experiments utilized high surface area, ZrO2 nanoparticles (99.95%, US Research Nanomaterials) with an average diameter of 20 nm. The ZrO2 nanoparticles absorb infrared radiation between ∼ 400 -800 cm -1 and leave an open window at &gt;800 cm -1 to monitor absorbance from the surface species.

The ZrO2 nanoparticles were mechanically pressed into a tungsten grid support to obtain the transmission FTIR measurements. 25,26 The tungsten grids were 2 cm × 3 cm, 50 μ m thick, with 100 grid lines per inch. The tungsten grid could be resistively heated and temperature controlled as described previously. 24,26 The Al2O3 /uniFB01 lms were grown on the ZrO2 nanoparticles with Al2 O3 ALD using TMA (97%, SigmaAldrich) and H2 O(Chromasolv for HPLC, Sigma-Aldrich). The Al2O3 ALE reactions were performed using sequential exposures of TMA (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) and HF derived from HF-pyridine (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich).

Static dosing of both the ALD and ALE precursors was performed to achieve self-limiting behavior on the high surface area particle substrates. Each reactant exposure consisted of a ∼ 1 Torr static dose for 10 s followed by a 240 s purge. The Al2O3 /uniFB01 lm on the ZrO2 nanoparticles was grown using 15 cycles of Al2 O3 ALD at 150 ° C. Subsequently, 8 cycles of Al O 2 3 ALE were performed at 300 ° C.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

TMA and HF on an Al2O3 substrate at 300 ° C. The initial Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm on the QCM crystal was deposited by 100 cycles of Al O 2 3 ALD using TMA and H2O at 300 ° C. One ALE cycle consisted of a TMA dose of 2.0 s, an N 2 purge of 30 s, a HF dose of 1.0 s, and a second N 2 purge of 30 s. This reaction sequence is represented as 2 -30 - -1 30. Pressure transients during TMA and HF exposures were ∼ 40 mTorr and ∼ 80 mTorr, respectively. These pressure transients were observed on top of the base pressure of ∼ 1 Torr in the reactor.

Figure 1 displays linear etching of the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm. A slope of the mass change versus time yields a mass change per cycle (MCPC) of -15.9 ng/(cm 2 cycle). This MCPC represents the removal of 9.4 × 10 13 ' Al2 O3 ' units/(cm 2 cycle). This MCPC is also equivalent to an etch rate of 0.51 Å/cycle based on the Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm density of 3.1 g/cm 3 determined by XRR. All ALE cycles show mass loss except during the /uniFB01 rst ALE cycle. The /uniFB01 rst cycle displays mass gains of Δ M TMA = 32 ng/cm 2 and Δ M HF = 33 ng/cm . 2

The mass gain for Δ M TMA during the /uniFB01 rst TMA exposure is attributed to the formation of AlCH3 * surface species on the initial hydroxylated Al O3 2 substrate. The asterisks designate a surface species. The mass gain for Δ M HF during the /uniFB01 rst HF exposure is attributed to the /uniFB02 uorination of the Al O 2 3 substrate. The HF exposure reacts with AlCH3 * to form AlF * surface species. HF exposure can also /uniFB02 uorinate the underlying Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm to form an AlF3 surface layer. The reaction Al O 2 3 + 6HF → 2AlF3 + 3H2O is spontaneous with Δ G = -49 kcal at 300 ° C. 27 This /uniFB01 rst cycle establishes the initial AlF3 layer on the Al2 O3 substrate.

Figure 2 shows an enlargement of the mass changes versus time at 300 ° C in the steady state region of Figure 1. Each reactant exposure leads to pronounced mass changes. The TMA exposure results in a mass decrease. This behavior indicates TMA can remove the AlF3 surface layer on the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm. A mass loss of Δ M TMA = -29 ng/cm 2 was observed after 2.0 s of TMA exposure. In contrast, the HF exposure leads to mass gain. A mass gain of Δ M HF = 13 ng/cm 2 was observed after 1.0 s of HF exposure. This mass gain is consistent with the

/uniFB02 uorination of Al O 2 3 to form an AlF3 surface layer. This AlF3 surface layer is then ready for the ligand-exchange reaction during the next TMA exposure.

Δ M HF mass changes are very constant. The MCPC is de /uniFB01 ned by MCPC = Δ M TMA + Δ M HF. Figure 3a displays Δ M TMA, Δ M HF and MCPC for the same 100 cycles of Al2 O3 ALE reaction at 300 ° C shown in Figure 1. A short nucleation period was observed before reaching steady state with MCPC = -15.9 ng/(cm 2 cycle). Figure 3b displays the Δ M TMA/MCPC ratio during the same 100 cycles. The Δ M TMA/MCPC ratio shows a steady-state value of 1.8 after the /uniFB01 rst three ALE cycles. The

Δ M TMA/MCPC ratio will be employed to de /uniFB01 ne the stoichiometry of the Al O 2 3 ALE reactions.

The self-limiting behavior can be con /uniFB01 rmed by monitoring mass change as a function of exposure for each reactant. Selflimiting ALE reactions are important for conformal or isotropic etching. Figure 4 examines the self-limiting nature of the Al O 2 3

ALE reactions at 300 ° C. Figure 4a shows Δ M TMA, the mass change after the TMA exposure, using di /uniFB00 erent TMA exposure times with a single 1.0 s exposure of HF. A constant N 2 purge of 30 s was used after each exposure. This reaction sequence can be represented as x -30 - -1 30. Δ M TMA versus the TMA exposure time decreases and levels o /uniFB00 slowly.

Figure 4b monitors Δ M HF, the mass change after the HF exposure, using di /uniFB00 erent HF exposure times with a single 2.0 s exposure of TMA. This reaction sequence can be denoted as 2 -30 - -x 30. Δ M HF versus the HF exposure time increases and then levels o /uniFB00 at approximately Δ M HF = 13 ng/(cm 2 cycle) after a 1.0 s HF exposure. This self-limiting behavior is consistent with HF /uniFB02 uorinating the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm and forming an AlF3 surface layer that passivates the underlying Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm.

Nearly self-limiting behavior at Δ M TMA = -29 ng/cm 2 is observed after 2.0 s of TMA exposure. This slow approach to self-limiting behavior may result from the di /uniFB03 culty in removing all of the AlF3 surface layer. An initial fraction of the AlF3 surface layer may be easily removed by TMA. The removal of more of the AlF3 surface layer may then become progressively di /uniFB03 cult. Additional analysis of the temperature dependence of the TMA reaction presented below will reveal that only a fraction of the AlF 3 surface layer is removed even at the highest temperatures.

This surface /uniFB02 uoride layer on Al O3 2 is similar to the native oxide layers formed on metals 28 -30 or silicon 31 -33 that protect the metals or silicon from further oxidation. The AlF 3 surface layer is expected to passivate the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm because the PillingBedworth ratio, RPB, is &gt;1. 34 RPB is the ratio of the molar volume, V, of the top layer to the molar volume of the underlying material. The molar volume, V = M/ ρ , where M is the molar mass and ρ is the density. VAlF3 = MAlF3/ ρ AlF3 = 29 cm 3 /mol because MAlF3 = 84 g/mol and ρ AlF3 = 2.9 g/cm 3 . VAl2O3 = MAl2O3/ ρ Al2O3 = 33 cm /mol because MAl2O3 3 = 102 g/ mol and ρ Al2O3 = 3.1 g/cm . Using these values, R 3 PB = (VAlF3 × 2)/VAl2O3 = 1.8. The factor of 2 accounts for the aluminum stoichiometry di /uniFB00 erence between AlF3 and Al2 O3.

Figure 5 displays the mass change during 100 ALE cycles at 250, 275, 300, and 325 ° C using the reaction sequence of 2 -

30 - -1 30. The initial Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were grown by 100 cycles of Al2 O3 ALD at the same temperatures. The mass changes versus time during Al2 O3 ALE are linear at all temperatures. The MCPC increases with temperature from -4.2 ng/(cm 2 cycle) at 250 ° C to -23.3 ng/(cm 2 cycle) at 325 ° C. These MCPCs correspond to etch rates that increase from 0.14 Å/cycle at 250 ° C to 0.75 Å/cycle at 325 ° C. The determination of these etch rates is based on the Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lm density of 3.1 g/cm . These results indicate that the Al O 3 2 3 etch rate can be controlled by the reaction temperature.

The nucleation of Al2 O3 ALE was examined at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures during the /uniFB01 rst several TMA and HF exposures. Figure 6 shows an enlargement of the mass changes during the /uniFB01 rst two Al2O3 ALE cycles for the di /uniFB00 erent temperatures in Figure 5. The /uniFB01 rst TMA exposure displays mass gains of Δ M TMA = 27 -32 ng/cm 2 at 250 -325 ° C. These mass gains result from the reaction of AlOH * surface species with TMA according to AlOH * + Al(CH3)3 → AlOAl(CH3)2 * + CH4.

The /uniFB01 rst HF exposure in Figure 6 then shows mass gains of Δ M HF = 33 -36 ng/cm 2 at 250 -325 ° C. These mass gains result from the reaction of AlCH3 * surface species with HF according to AlCH3 * + HF → AlF * + CH4. In addition, some of the underlying Al2 O3 is also converted to an AlF3 surface layer. The /uniFB02 uorination reaction Al O 2 3 + 6HF → 2AlF3 + 3H2O is spontaneous over the temperature range from 250 to 325 ° C. The Gibbs free energy changes are negative and change slightly from Δ G = -53.8 kcal at 250 ° C to Δ G = -46.8 kcal at 325 ° C. 27 Figure 6 shows that the /uniFB02 uorination of Al O 2 3 to form an 2AlF3 surface layer is nearly constant at all temperatures.

Figure 6. Expansion of /uniFB01 rst two ALE cycles in Figure 5 showing the individual mass changes during the sequential TMA and HF exposures at 250, 275, 300, and 325 ° C.

HF exposures on initial, hydroxylated Al O 2 3 substrates prior to TMA exposures showed very similar mass gains of Δ M HF = 35 -38 ng/cm 2 at 150 -250 ° C. 7 This similarity of the mass gains for HF exposure on the initial hydroxylated Al2 O3 substrate and for HF exposure on the Al2O3 substrate after the TMA exposure results from the similar molar mass of the AlCH3 * and AlOH * species. The AlCH3 * and AlOH * species lead to the production of CH 4 and H2O, respectively. The mass changes resulting from these reactions, together with the mass gains occurring during the /uniFB02 uorination of Al O 2 3 to produce an AlF3 surface layer, are nearly equivalent.

The mass gain of Δ M HF = 33 -36 ng/cm 2 at 250 -325 ° C can be employed to estimate the thickness of the AlF 3 surface layer on the Al O 2 3 substrate. This estimation assumes that the mass change from the reaction AlCH3 * + HF → AlF * + CH4 is negligible compared with the /uniFB02 uorination of Al2 O3. The /uniFB02 uorination reaction Al2 O3 + 6HF → 2AlF3 + 3H2O will result in a mass increase of 65%. This mass increase is expected from the masses of 102 amu for Al O3 2 and 168 amu for 2AlF3. Therefore, the average value of Δ M HF = 34 ng/cm 2 corresponds to the conversion of 52.5 ng/cm 2 of Al2 O3 into 86.5 ng/cm 2 of the AlF 3 layer. Based on the density of 3.1 g/ cm 3 for Al2 O3, 22 the mass of 52.5 ng/cm 2 for Al2 O3 is equivalent to an Al O 2 3 thickness of 1.7 Å. Likewise, based on the density of 2.9 g/cm 3 for AlF , 3 22 the mass of 86.5 ng/cm 2 for AlF3 is equivalent to an AlF 3 thickness of 3.0 Å.

XPS measurements also examined the /uniFB01 lm composition after the HF exposures during Al O 2 3 ALE at 300 ° C. The Al O3 2 /uniFB01 lms were exposed to atmosphere after the Al O 2 3 ALE and prior to the XPS studies. The XPS analysis yielded F concentrations of 4 -6 at. % including the adventitious carbon. Fluorine concentrations of 4 -6 at. % are in approximate agreement with the expected photoelectron yield from a layered sample consisting of a 6 Å thick adventitious carbon layer 35 on a 3 Å thick AlF3 layer on an Al2 O3 substrate. The model for the photoelectron sources employed the C, F, Al and O number densities in each layer and the Beer -Lambert equation integrated over the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses. The Beer -Lambert equation is I = I0 exp[-d/ λ sin Θ ] where I 0 is the initial photoelectron intensity, d is the distance traveled through the layer and Θ is the angle to the surface normal. 36 The electron mean free path, λ , was based on approximate expressions for λ given in the literature. 37

After the /uniFB01 rst HF exposure, the next TMA exposure removes the AlF 3 layer on the Al O 2 3 substrate. Figure 6 shows that mass losses during the TMA and HF cycles begin with the second TMA and HF cycle for temperatures from 275 -325 ° C. The TMA and HF cycles at 250 ° C show a mass loss after the third ALE cycle. Figure 6 reveals that higher temperatures produce both a larger mass loss for the removal of AlF 3 by TMA and a larger mass gain for the subsequent /uniFB02 uorination of Al2 O3 by HF.

Figure 7 shows enlargements of the mass changes during three cycles in the steady state etching regime for Al O 2 3 ALE at

250, 275, and 325 ° C. Mass losses are observed after the TMA exposures. These mass losses suggest that Al(CH3)3 can remove the AlF3 surface layer as volatile AlF(CH3)2 product according to the reactions AlF 3 * + Al(CH3)3 → AlF2CH3 * + AlF(CH3)2 and AlF2(CH3) * + Al(CH3)3 → 2AlF(CH3)2. Earlier experiments observed the continuous etching of an AlF 3 /uniFB01 lm by Al(CH3)3 at 300 ° C. 10 This behavior suggests that the formation of volatile AlF(CH3)2 product is favorable. Mass spectrometry studies are needed to con /uniFB01 rm these proposed volatile reaction products.

The mass losses are larger at higher temperatures. A small mass decrease is observed after the TMA exposure at 250 ° C. Figure 7a displays a mass loss of Δ M TMA = -10.5 ng/cm 2 after the TMA exposure for 2.0 s at 250 ° C. Larger mass decreases are observed after the TMA exposures at 275 and 325 ° C. Figures 7b shows a mass loss of Δ M TMA = -20.5 ng/cm 2 after a

TMA exposure for 2.0 s at 275 ° C. Figure 7c displays an even larger mass loss of Δ M TMA = -41.9 ng/cm 2 after a TMA exposure for 2.0 s at 325 ° C.

In contrast, mass increases are observed after the HF /uniFB02 uorination reactions. These mass increases are consistent with the /uniFB02 uorination of Al O 2 3 to AlF3 . A mass increase of Δ M HF = 6.3 ng/cm 2 is observed after the HF exposure for 1.0 s at 250 ° C as shown in Figure 7a. HF exposures for 1.0 s produce larger mass gains of Δ M HF = 9.9 ng/cm 2 at 275 ° C and Δ M HF = 18.6 ng/cm 2 at 325 ° C as shown in Figures 7b and 7c, respectively. However, these Δ M HF values in the steady state regime are much less than the Δ M HF values observed in the /uniFB01 rst Al2 O3 ALE cycle on initial, hydroxylated Al O 2 3 substrates in Figure 6. The smaller mass gains observed for Δ M HF in the steady state regime suggest that the HF exposures may be removing surface species in addition to /uniFB02 uorinating Al O . The TMA exposures 2 3 may also not be removing all the AlF3 layer prior to the subsequent HF /uniFB02 uorination reaction.

From the QCM measurements in Figure 6, the average value of Δ M HF = 34 ng/cm 2 during the /uniFB01 rst HF exposure corresponds to the conversion of 52.5 ng/cm 2 of Al2 O3 into 86.5 ng/cm 2 of the AlF 3 layer. If TMA can remove the entire AlF3 layer on Al2O3, then Δ M TMA is limited to a maximum value of Δ M TMA = -86.5 ng/cm . Because TMA can also form 2 AlCH3 * surface species after AlF 3 removal, the AlCH3 * surface species could add 30 ng/cm 2 based on the averaged results for the /uniFB01 rst TMA exposure on the Al2 O3 substrate at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures shown in Figure 6. Consequently, Δ M TMA is limited to a maximum value of Δ M TMA = -56.5 ng/cm . 2

Calculations were performed to estimate the amount of AlF 3 removal during the TMA exposures at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures using the measured Δ M TMA values. The percentage of AlF3 removed is based on the maximum value of Δ M TMA = -56.5 ng/cm 2 expected if the entire AlF 3 layer is removed by TMA. These calculations revealed that the percentage of AlF3 removed by the TMA exposures increases with temperature. The percentages increased from 19% at 250 ° C to 74% at 325 ° C. The percentages of AlF 3 removal at all the temperatures are summarized in Table 1.

The Δ M TMA, Δ M HF, and MCPC values at all the reaction temperatures are shown in Figure 8. All ALE reactions were performed using a reaction sequence of 2 -30 - -1 30 on initial Al2 O3 substrates. Figure 8a displays the Δ M TMA and Δ M HF values obtained at di /uniFB00 erent reaction temperatures. Δ M TMA shows progressively larger mass losses at higher temperatures. In contrast, Δ M HF reveals progressively larger mass gains at higher temperatures. The temperature dependence of Δ M TMA dominates the temperature dependence observed in the MCPC shown in Figure 8b. Δ M TMA, Δ M HF, MCPC, the etch rate, and the Δ M TMA/MCPC ratio are summarized in Table 1.

III.B. XRR and SE Measurements. Al2 O3 ALE was also examined using ex situ XRR studies. For these experiments, Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms with a thickness of 141 Å were grown on Si(100) wafers at 300 ° C. In addition, Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lms with a thickness of 170 Å were grown on Si(100) wafers at 200 ° C.

These Al2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were deposited using 150 cycles of TMA and H2O with a reaction sequence of 1 -20 - -1 20. The XRR scans of the Al2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms on the Si wafers grown at 300 ° C versus the number of TMA and HF reaction cycles at 300 ° C are displayed in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 9 shows the XRR measurements of the initial Al2O3 /uniFB01 lm thickness and the Al2 O3 /uniFB01 lm thickness after 25, 50, 100, and 200 ALE cycles at 300 ° C. The initial Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lms grown at 300 and 200 ° C had initial thicknesses of 141 and 170 Å, respectively. The /uniFB01 lm thickness versus number of ALE cycles in Figure 9a is linear and yields an etch rate of 0.46 Å/cycle. The spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements on these same samples also yield an etch rate of 0.46 Å/cycle. The di /uniFB00 erent growth temperatures for the two Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lms did not a /uniFB00 ect the Al2 O3 etch rate. In addition, the etch rates determined by XRR and SE are similar to the etch rate obtained by the in situ QCM experiments at 300 ° C.

The y intercepts from the linear least-squares /uniFB01 tting in Figure 9a are 142 Å for the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lms grown at 300 ° C for both the XRR and SE measurements. These thicknesses are slightly higher than the initial thicknesses of 141 and 139 Å measured by XRR and SE, respectively. These slightly larger thicknesses originate from the mass gain that occurs during the nucleation of the ALE process on the /uniFB01 rst ALE cycle. The SE analysis also determined a refractive index of n = 1.67 for the Al2 O3 /uniFB01 lm grown at 300 ° C at a wavelength of 589 nm. This refractive index for the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm remained at n = 1.68 after 25, 50, 100, and 200 ALE cycles. Similar behavior was observed for the

III.C. FTIR Spectroscopy Measurements. An Al2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm was /uniFB01 rst grown using 15 cycles of TMA and H O at 150 2 ° C on ZrO2 nanoparticles. FTIR spectroscopy measurements of the Al O3 2 ALD /uniFB01 lm growth are presented in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. Following the Al O 2 3 ALD, the sample temperature was raised to 300 ° C, and the Al2 O3 /uniFB01 lm was etched using sequential exposures of TMA and HF. FTIR spectra recorded during the TMA and HF exposures at 300 ° C are shown in Figure 10. These spectra were recorded after the HF exposures and are again referenced to the starting ZrO2 nanoparticle substrate. The progressive loss in absorbance between 800 and 1000 cm -1 with ALE cycles is in agreement with the etching of the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm.

ALE cycle at 300 ° C. These di /uniFB00 erence spectra are referenced to the spectra after the previous reactant exposure. After TMA exposures, an increase in absorbance at ∼ 1212 cm -1 is observed in Figure 11a that is in accord with the addition of AlCH3 * surface species. These AlCH 3 * species may be present as either AlF(CH3)2 * , AlF2(CH3) * , or -OAl(CH3)2 * . All of these species would be expected to show a methyl deformation mode at ∼ 1212 cm -1 . However, since AlF(CH3)2 is expected to have a higher volatility than other species , the vibrational feature at 1212 cm -1 is likely attributed to AlF (CH ) 2 3 * or -OAl(CH3)2 * . In addition, a decrease in absorbance between ∼ 850 and 975 cm -1 is observed that is consistent with the loss of absorbance from Al -F stretching vibrations as TMA removes the AlF3 surface layer.

Figure 11b shows the absorbance after the subsequent HF exposure. The absorbance is completely removed for the vibrational feature attributed to the addition of AlCH 3 * species. This loss of absorbance is in accord with the conversion of AlCH3 * surface species to AlF * species. The HF exposure also results in a broad absorbance loss between 800 and 1100 cm -1 that is in agreement with the conversion of Al O 2 3 into AlF 3 by the reaction Al O 2 3 + 6HF → 2AlF3 + 3H2O. Figure 11b also reveals an absorbance increase on the broad absorbance loss between ∼ 850 and 950 cm -1 that is consistent with the formation of the AlF 3 layer.

Figure 12 shows the di /uniFB00 erence spectra from 2500 to 4000 cm -1 for the same consecutive TMA and HF exposures at 300 ° C that are displayed in Figure 11. Figure 12a shows the di /uniFB00 erence spectrum after the TMA exposure. An increase in absorbance is observed at ∼ 2900 and 2950 cm -1 that is in agreement with the addition of symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of AlCH3 * species, respectively. This absorbance gain is in accord with the formation of AlF (CH ) 2 3 * or -OAl(CH3)2 * species after TMA exposures. Figure 12b shows the di /uniFB00 erence spectrum after the HF exposure. The

spectrum observes an absorbance decrease at ∼ 2900 and ∼ 2950 cm -1 that is consistent with the removal of the previously added AlCH3 * species.

There are also no vibrational features in Figure 12a and b between ∼ 3000 and 3675 cm -1 that would indicate HF * surface species. Vibrational features for HF * were observed during AlF3 ALD using TMA and HF at lower temperatures. 22 HF * species are important intermediates during AlF3 ALD growth. The desorption of HF * surface species at higher temperatures allows TMA to accept /uniFB02 uorine from the underlying AlF3 /uniFB01 lm and form volatile etch products that lead to Al O3 2 etching. At lower temperatures, HF * surface species remain on the surface and react with TMA to form AlF3. 22 Temperature can determine whether TMA and HF lead to either AlF 3 ALD or Al2O3 ALE.

III.D. Proposed Al O3 2 ALE Mechanism. Figure 13 shows the schematic for the proposed ALE reaction mechanism. This mechanism is based on the mass changes during the TMA and

HF exposures as determined by the QCM measurements. This visualization does not include surface species that do not change during the HF and TMA reactions. During the /uniFB02 uorination reaction (A), HF reacts with AlCH3 * surface species to form AlF * surface species and CH 4 reaction product. HF also reacts with the underlying Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm to form an AlF3 surface layer and H O as a reaction product. The AlF 2 3 layer is then ready for the next TMA reaction.

During the ligand-exchange reaction (B), TMA reacts with the AlF3 surface layer on the Al O 2 3 substrate to form volatile AlF(CH3)2 reaction products. AlF(CH3 2 ) has a vapor pressure of 80 Torr at 100 ° C. 38 There also may be AlF (CH3) 2 * surface species produced by the TMA exposures. These AlF2(CH3) * surface species could be removed by additional TMA exposure. The reaction for the removal of AlF (CH ) 2 3 * surface species is Al(CH3)3 + AlF2(CH3) * → 2AlF(CH3)2. After the removal of /uniFB02 uorine-containing species, Al(CH ) 3 3 could also react with the underlying Al O3 2 substrate to form Al(CH3) * .

The simplest overall proposed reaction can be expressed as

$$0 \quad & \text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + 6 \text{HF} + 4 \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \to 6 \text{AlF} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } + 3 \text{H} _ { 2 } O \quad & \text{(1)}$$

This overall reaction can be divided into the HF and TMA reactions:

$$A _ { \Lambda } ^ { \quad } ( A ) A _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | A _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } \dagger + 6 H F \to A _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | 2 A I F _ { 3 } \dagger + 3 H _ { 2 } O \quad ( 2 )$$

$$\i e ^ { ( B ) A _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | 2 A I F _ { 3 } \dagger + 4 A I ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \to A _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } \dagger + 6 A I F ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } } _ { h }$$

The daggers indicate the species involved in the etching, and the vertical lines are used to separate the various surface species. The amount of Al2O3 that is etched during the ALE reactions is given by Al O3 2 † in eqs 2 and 3.

The reactions described by eqs 1 -3 are incomplete because TMA can also interact with the etched surface. For example, the reaction of TMA with Al2O3 is known to form AlCH3 * surface species. 39 This reaction of Al(CH3)3 with Al -O Al -bonds on the Al2O3 substrate can be expressed as

$$\begin{matrix} \theta & \text{Al-O-Al} * + \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \\ \text{is} \\ \text{is} \end{matrix} \quad \rightarrow \text{Al-O-Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } * + \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) ^ { * }$$

TMA may also interact with AlF3 species remaining on the etched surface. To incorporate the Al(CH ) 3 3 * species, the HF and TMA reactions need be modi /uniFB01 ed:

$$& ( A ) \, \text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | x \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } * + ( 6 + 3 x ) \text{HF} \\ & \quad \rightarrow 2 \text{Al} \text{F} _ { 3 } | x \text{Al} \text{F} _ { 3 } * + 3 \text{H} _ { 2 } O + 3 x \text{CH} _ { 4 }$$

$$\to x \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ^ { * } + ( 6 + 3 x ) \text{AlF} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 }$$

The conventions are slightly di /uniFB00 erent in the HF and TMA reactions given by eqs 2 and 3 and eqs 5 and 6. The amount of Al2 O3 that is etched during the ALE reactions is given by Al O 2 3 in eqs 5 and 6. x is a parameter that de /uniFB01 nes the number of Al(CH3)3 * species relative to the number of Al2O3 units that are etched during the ALE reaction.

The overall proposed reaction can then be expressed as

$$& \text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + ( 6 + 3 x ) \text{HF} + ( 4 + 3 x ) \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \\ & \quad \rightarrow ( 6 + 3 x ) \text{Al} F ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } + 3 \text{H} _ { 2 } O + 3 x \text{CH} _ { 4 } \text{ \quad \ \ } ( 7 )$$

x can be calculated from the Δ M TMA/MCPC ratio using the equation:

$$x = ( 2 \times 8 4 - 1 0 2 ( \Delta M _ { T M A } / M C P C ) ) / ( 7 2 - 8 4 ) \quad ( 8 ) \quad \text{$\emph{$\emph{$\emph{$acc$}$} }$}$$

where 84, 102, and 72 are the molecular weights for AlF3, Al2 O3, and Al(CH3)3, respectively. To obtain agreement with the relative Δ M TMA and Δ M HF mass changes in Table 1, x = 7.7, 2.5, 1.6, and 1.4 at 250, 275, 300, and 325 ° C, respectively. Although x decreases at higher temperatures, the product x MCPC is fairly constant over the entire temperature range. This behavior results from the increase in MCPC and the decrease in x at higher temperatures. These temperature dependences yield a nearly constant x MCPC product versus temperature. Because x is de /uniFB01 ned relative to the amount of Al2 O3 that is etched during the ALE reaction, the absolute Al(CH3)3 * coverages are proportional to x MCPC. The nearly constant x MCPC values in Table 1 indicate that the absolute Al(CH3)3 * coverages are similar at all the etching temperatures. The larger etch rates at higher temperatures are attributed to the higher percentage of the AlF3 surface layer removed by ligand-exchange reactions during TMA exposures at higher temperatures.

## IV. CONCLUSIONS

Al2 O3 ALE was demonstrated using sequential, self-limiting thermal reactions with HF and TMA as the reactants. TMA is an e /uniFB00 ective metal precursor for the ligand-exchange transmetalation reaction during thermal ALE. Al2O3 ALD can be performed using TMA and H2O. Al2 O3 ALE can be accomplished using TMA and HF. The ability of TMA to lead to either Al2 O3 ALD or Al2O3 ALE suggests that metal ALD precursors for a particular material may also be employed for the ALE of the same material.

Al2 O3 ALE was studied at temperatures from 250 to 325 ° C using QCM experiments. The QCM studies revealed that the Al2 O3 ALE was linear versus the number of HF and TMA reaction cycles. The sequential HF and TMA reactions were self-limiting versus reactant exposure. The Al O 2 3 etching rates were larger at higher temperatures. The etch rates varied from 0.14 Å/cycle at 250 ° C to 0.75 Å/cycle at 325 ° C. XRR and SE studies con /uniFB01 rmed the linearity of Al O 2 3 ALE and the etching rates. FTIR spectroscopy studies observed the loss of infrared absorbance from the Al -O stretching vibrations during Al O 2 3 ALE. The FTIR studies also identi /uniFB01 ed AlF * surface species after the HF exposures and AlCH3 * species after the TMA exposures.

The overall reaction for Al2 O3 ALE is believed to be described by Al2 O3 + 4Al(CH3)3 + 6HF → 6AlF(CH3)2 + 3H2O. This overall reaction is the result of individual /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. The HF exposure /uniFB02 uorinates the Al O 2 3 substrate and forms an AlF 3 surface layer and H2O as the reaction products. In a ligand-exchange transmetalation reaction, TMA accepts F from the AlF3 layer and donates CH3 to the AlF3 layer to produce volatile AlF(CH3)2 reaction products. The AlF3 surface layer was estimated to have a thickness of 3.0 Å on Al O 2 3 after the HF exposures. The larger etch rates at higher temperatures result from the removal of a larger fraction of the AlF 3 surface layer by TMA at higher temperatures. The ability to change the metal precursor and the ligands during the ligand-exchange reaction may also provide pathways to selective ALE.
