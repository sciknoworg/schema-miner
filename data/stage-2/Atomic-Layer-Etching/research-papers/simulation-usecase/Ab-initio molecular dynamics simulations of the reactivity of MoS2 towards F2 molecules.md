We investigated the reactivity of fluorinated monolayer and bilayer MoS2  in relation to etching processes. We considered both the energetics and the dynamics of the different processes: a) interaction of fluorine species in the gas phase with MoS2, b) the surface chemistry of SF, SF2,  and SF3 groups and c) the desorption of fluorinecontaining  molecules  into  the  gas  phase.  The  dissociative  adsorption  of  F2  occurs  at  very  low  temperatures (100 K) and the surface becomes populated by SF, SF2 (the most stable), and SF3 groups. Etching processes begin with the desorption of the SF3  group and only at very high temperatures the desorption of SF2  was observed. Sulfur vacancies left by the removal of S atoms are rapidly filled by F atoms due to the formation of strong Mo -F bonds. The formation of a sulfur vacancy induces the subsequent formation of S-vacancies on adjacent surface sites, and this finally promotes the desorption of MoF5  or MoF6  species, thus leaving a surface pit defect. For a MoS2  bilayer  with  the  top  layer  fluorinated  on  both  sides,  the  etching  of  the  top  layer  was  observed  as  a consequence of the release of SFx  species within the interlayer region.

## 1. Introduction

MoS2 to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction.[17,18].

The electronic properties of two-dimensional MoS2  depend on the number  of  layers.[1]  Multilayered  MoS2  has  an  indirect  bandgap  of ~1.3 eV which increases to ~1.9 eV for single-layer MoS2. The direct bandgap of the monolayer confers MoS2 a strong luminescence and high quantum yield with promising applications in different optoelectronic devices.[2,3] Therefore, controlling the number of layers of 2D materials is indispensable for nanodevice applications because of their layerdependent  optical  features.  Controlling  the  thickness  of  MoS2 films during  growth is  a  difficult  task  due  to  nonuniform  domains  having different number of layers.[4,5] A different strategy is to remove MoS2 layers after synthesis using post-treatment procedures. Etching is one of the key steps in materials processing in the semiconducting industry and several  etching  techniques  have  been  proposed  to  control  the  layer number and patterning of 2D materials.[4 -12] The main etching techniques include plasma etching,[5,7,8,11,13] laser thinning,[4,14], and thermal annealing thinning.[6,15] Thinning of MoS2 leads to enhanced photoluminescence  which  is  beneficial  for  photodetector  fabrication. [13,16] Etching of MoS2 also induces the activation of the basal plane of

The fluorinated gases (SF6,[13,19,20] CF4,[21] and XeF2[22]) used in  gas-assisted  etching  are  attractive  candidates  for  the  spontaneous etching of 2D materials because Mo and S elements form volatile compounds  with  fluorine  at  room  temperature.  XeF2 has  been  used  to spontaneously etch MoS2 at room temperature with a uniform change of layer  number.[22]  Multilayer  WSe2 can  also  be  thinned  down  to monolayer and bilayer upon exposure to XeF2  vapor.[23] On the contrary, MoS2 etching was not observed after Cl-radical adsorption, and it required  a  subsequent  Ar + ion-beam  desorption  step  to  achieve  the complete etching of one monolayer of MoS2.[24] The atomic picture of etching mechanisms is unknown in most cases. For the XeF2 etchant, the following overall reaction has been proposed:[22] MoS2 + XeF2 ‚Üí Xe + MoF4 + SF6,  where  the  products  are  gaseous species.

The electronic structure of F adatoms on MoS2 has been studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT).[25 -27] At low coverages, the F atom adsorbs on top of the S atom whereas at high coverages the S -F bond is slightly  tilted  with  respect  to  the  surface  normal.[25,26]  The  high electronegativity of fluorine induces a charge transfer of around 0.5 e

towards the F atoms, which produces p -type doping of MoS2.[25,26] Substitutional fluorine doping using a gentle SF6 plasma treatment has a p -type doping effect for monolayer MoS2.[29] Therefore, the fluorination of MoS2 can be used to tune the catalytic activity of either the basal plane[27,28] or the edges[30] of MoS2.

Notably, the surface chemistry involved in the interaction of fluorine atoms with the MoS2 surface has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Previous total energy calculations performed at the DFT level (corresponding to a temperature of 0 K) only considered SF surface moieties, [25 27] but failed to identify SF2 and SF3 moieties, which play a key role -in  the  etching of  MoS2. In this work we first consider the energetics involved in a) the interaction of the F2 molecule and the F atom with the MoS2 surface, b) the formation of SFx groups and their surface reactions, c) the desorption of SFx species, which is the onset of the etching process. In the second part, we investigate the dynamics of the fluorinated surfaces at different temperatures, which clearly reveal the mechanisms of surface reactions and desorption processes. The MoS2  surface is very reactive  toward F2  molecules and high surface coverages are readily obtained. The SF2 surface group is the most stable, having stronger S -F bonds than the SF and SF3  groups. The etching process mainly begins with the desorption of SF3 species which, upon abstraction of an F atom from adjacent surface sites, leads to the desorption of SF4 molecules into the gas phase. Sulfur vacancies are readily occupied by F atoms leading to  the  formation of strong Mo -F bonds and this finally leads to the desorption of MoF6 molecules.

## 2. Theoretical methods and surface modelling

Ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at the DFT level of theory were performed using the Quantum Espresso (QE) package.[31] The  Perdew Burke Ernzerhof  (PBE)  exchange ---correlation  functional [32] and norm-conserving ultrasoft pseudopotentials were employed. [33] The one-electron wave functions were expanded in a plane-wave basis set up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 40 Ry (240 Ry for the density). The calculations were performed with a 3 ‚àö 3 √ó 6 MoS2 supercell with dimensions 16.71 √Ö √ó 19.30 √Ö which exposes 24 S atoms on each surface.  For  this  large  unit  cell,  calculations  were  performed  at  the gamma point. A time step of 1 fs was used in the MD simulations and the temperature was set using a Berendsen thermostat. The longest simulations were performed up to around 25 picoseconds (25,000 simulation steps). Dispersive forces using Grimme s ' semiempirical DFT-D2 approach were employed in the dynamics involving the adsorption of F2.[34] The climbing-image nudged-elastic-band (CI-NEB) method was employed to find energy profiles along reaction paths.[35] CI-NEB calculations were performed using a 3 √ó 3 supercell and the integration in the  first  Brillouin  zone  was  performed  with  a  (4 √ó 4 √ó 1)  Monkhorst -Pack  mesh.[36]  Calculations  were  performed  for  both  monolayer and bilayer MoS2.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Energetics of formation of surface species from F2  and F in the gas phase

The fluorine molecule adsorbs at a height of 2.91 √Ö above the sulfur atom with its axes parallel to the MoS2 surface (Fig. 1a). The adsorption process is exothermic with Œî E =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.47 eV, showing that there is a strong interaction between F2  and the pristine MoS2  monolayer. Small inorganic molecules have much lower adsorption energies, typically ranging from GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.10 to GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.25 eV.[37 -40] The F -F bond distance increases from 1.417 √Ö in vacuum to 1.581 √Ö upon adsorption. The weakening of the F -F bond is a consequence of charge transfer process from the surface to the œÉ *2p antibonding  orbital.  The  electron  density  difference  plot  in Fig. 1a shows a region of charge accumulation around the F atoms which resembles the shape of œÉ *2p orbital. Fig. 1b shows the electron difference plot around an F atom bound to a sulfur atom. Besides the region of charge accumulation around the F atom, regions of charge depletion are observed along the S -Mo bonds, which anticipate the weakening of these bonds. The formation of the S -F bond from a fluorine atom in vacuum has Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2.18 eV and the adsorption of the F atom on an S vacancy site has Œî E =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 4.61 eV. In the latter case, the F atom adsorbs in the hollow site between three Mo atoms (see Fig. S1). The surface S -F bond (2.18 eV) is weaker than the average S -F bond strength in the SF4 molecule  for  which  we  calculated  a  value  of  4.06  eV.  The  different strength between surface and gas-phase S -F bonds explains many features observed in the MD simulations. The strong interaction of F atoms on the pristine and S defective MoS2  surface and the weak F -F bond energy of the fluorine molecule, which is 1.60 eV[41], indicate that the dissociative adsorption of F2 will be an exothermic process, as we show next.

A CI-NEB calculation for the reaction F2 (ads) ‚Üí SF2  shows that the F -F bond of the adsorbed fluorine molecule breaks with a small energy barrier of 0.23 eV to yield a surface SF2  group in a very exothermic reaction with Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1.85 eV (energy profile along reaction path in Fig. S2). MoS2 is therefore an efficient catalyst for F2 dissociation, as the barrier for this process decreases from 1.60 eV in vacuum[41] to 0.23 eV on the MoS2 surface. Finally, considering as a reference the F2 molecule in  the  gas  phase,  the  energy  change  for  the  dissociative  adsorption process (yielding an SF2 group) can be calculated from:

$$F _ { 2 ( g a ) } + \Lambda \L O S _ { 2 } \to S F _ { 2 } \ \Delta E = - 2. 3 2 \, e V$$

which clearly shows the high reactivity of MoS2 toward F2.

Fluorinated surfaces have three stable surface groups: SF, SF2  and SF3 (surface structures shown in Fig. S3). We calculated the average S -F bond strength of the different species from the following reactions:

$$\ u c u u d a _ { \substack { F _ { ( g a s ) } + M o S _ { 2 } \to SF \ \Delta E = - 2. 1 8 \, e V } } } ( 2 )$$

$$\i e { \text{-wave} } \quad 2 F _ { ( g a ) } + \text{MoS} _ { 2 } \to \text{SF} _ { 2 } \ \Delta E = - 4. 7 9 \, e V$$

$$\underset { \text{mercell} } { \overset { \dots } { \sim } } & \ 3 F _ { ( g a s ) } + \Lambda \L S _ { 2 } \to \mathcal { S } F _ { 3 } \ \Delta \mathcal { E } = - 6. 4 3 \, e \, V$$

Dividing the Œî E values of reactions (2)-(4) by the number of bonds, we  obtained  average  S -F  bond  strengths  of  2.18  eV,  2.40  eV,  and

2.14 eV, for the SF, SF2,  and SF3  groups, respectively. The SF2  moiety, therefore, has the strongest surface bonds and this is evidenced in the MD simulations in the next sections.

## 3.2. Energetics of surface reactions

Fig. S4 contains the energy profiles along the reaction path obtained from CI-NEB calculations for the following surface processes:

$$S F + S \to S + S F \ \Delta E = 0. 0 0 \, e V$$

$$S F + S F \to S + S F _ { 2 } \ \Delta E = - 0. 3 1 \, e V \quad \quad ( 6 ) \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \$$

$$S F + S F _ { 2 } \to S + S F _ { 3 } \ \Delta E = 0. 3 1 \, e V$$

$$2 S F _ { 2 } \to S F + S F _ { 3 } \ \Delta E = 0. 1 3 \ e V & ( 8 ) \quad \text{leaving } t$$

Reaction (5) corresponds to the diffusion of an F atom to an adjacent S site and has an energy barrier of 0.54 eV (Fig. S4). When an F atom diffuses to an adjacent SF group to yield an SF2  moiety (Reaction (6)), the energy barrier decreases to 0.29 eV and the reaction is exothermic with Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.31 eV. However, the formation of the SF3 moiety by the diffusion of an F atom to an SF2 group (Reaction (7)) has a higher energy barrier of 0.55  eV  and  the  reaction  becomes  endothermic  with Œî E = 0.31  eV.  Finally,  the  disproportionation  reaction  between  two adjacent SF2 groups to yield SF and SF3 groups (Reaction (8)) is slightly endothermic and has a small barrier of 0.27 eV. In summary, the energetics of the surface reactions show that the most stable surface group is the SF2  moiety. As the surface coverage of SF2  groups increases, the conversion to SF3 may occur according to Reaction (8).

## 3.3. Energetics of desorption processes

We calculated the Œî E values for the following etching reactions in which surface SFx species are desorbed into the gas phase:

$$S \to S _ { ( g a s ) } \ \Delta E = 5. 9 4 \, e V$$

$$\i d a n e d \quad & \text{SF} \to \text{SF} _ { ( g a s ) } \ \Delta E = 3. 7 8 \, e V \quad & ( 1 0 )$$

$$\Phi _ { \varepsilon } \quad S F _ { 2 } \to S F _ { 2 ( g a s ) } \ \Delta E = 2. 0 8 \ e V$$

$$\Phi _ { \Phi } \rightarrow S F _ { 3 \left ( \text{gas} \right ) } \ \Delta E = 0. 3 9 \, e V$$

$$\sum _ { \sigma \nu } \ & \text{SF} + \text{SF} _ { 3 } \rightarrow \text{SF} _ { 4 ( g a s ) } \ \Delta E = - 1. 1 1 \ e V$$

These  desorption  reactions  involve  the  breakage  of  S -Mo bonds leaving the surface with an S vacancy site. As a reference, the Œî E value for the desorption of atomic sulfur is also included (Reaction (9)). Its large endothermic value is consistent with the high chemical and thermal stability of MoS2. Reactions (10)-(12) show that the Œî E values for the desorption of SF, SF2,  and SF3  become less endothermic, which is consistent with the observation that the formation of SF bonds weakens the  S -Mo  backbonds  (Fig.  1).  The  weakening  of  S -Mo  bonds  is consistent  with  the  increasing  S -Mo bond  lengths  for  these  groups 2.38  √Ö,  2.45  √Ö,  and  2.59  √Ö,  respectively  (Fig.  S3).  The  fact  that desorption of an SF3  molecule only requires 0.39 eV predicts that this species will have an important role in the etching of MoS2. Finally, the desorption of SF4 from surface SF and SF3 groups (Reaction (13)) is very exothermic with Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1.11 eV. This reaction was observed in the MD simulations when a desorbing SF3  group abstracts an F atom from an adjacent SF moiety. A CI-NEB calculation (Fig. S5) shows that this reaction occurs in two steps according to:

$$\text{SF} + \text{SF} _ { 3 } \rightarrow \text{SF} _ { 4 ( a d s ) } \ \Delta \text{E} = - 1. 5 6 \, e V$$

$$S F _ { 4 ( a d s ) } \to S F _ { 4 ( g a s ) } \ \Delta E = 0. 4 5 \, e V & ( 1 5 ) \quad \frac { \partial \cos \mu _ { P } } { \partial \Sigma _ { P } \sim \pm }$$

First, an adsorbed SF4  molecule is formed on a S-vacancy site in an exothermic reaction with Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1.56 eV and energy barrier of 1.28 eV (reaction (14)). Then, the SF4 molecule desorbs with Œî E = 0.45 (reaction (15)).

In summary, the MoS2 surface has a high reactivity towards fluorine molecules  due  to  the  weakened  F -F  bond  of  the  adsorbed  fluorine molecule (Fig. S2) as a consequence of charge transfer processes to the œÉ *2p  antibonding orbital. On the other hand, the etching processes are anticipated by the differences in S -F bond strengths between surface and gas-phase species.  For  example,  whereas  the  average  S -F  bond strength in surface SF2 moieties is 2.40 eV, it amounts to 4.06 eV in the SF4  molecule. These differences in bond strength make Reaction (13) exothermic.

## 3.4. AIMD simulations

## 3.4.1. Reactivity of the MoS2  surface at 100 K

The high reactivity of the MoS2 surface towards F2 is observed even at very low temperatures, as a consequence of the low energy barrier involved in F -F bond breakage (Section 3.1). Four F2  molecules were placed in the vacuum region of the unit cell (inset in Fig. 2a) and were allowed to react at 100 K. Fig. 2a shows the height above the surface of the  center  of  mass  of  each  F2 molecule  and  Fig.  2b  contains  the corresponding F -F distances. Dissociative adsorption is observed for all molecules yielding SF and SF2  surface groups (Fig. 2c) and these processes are very exothermic as shown in the energy profile of Fig. 2d. The red profile in Fig. 2a corresponds to the case of an F2  molecule which yields  an  SF2 surface  moiety  after  adsorbing  on  the  surface.  Consequently, the F -F bond length increases from 1.49 √Ö in the gas phase to 2.15 √Ö in the SF2  moiety (red profile in Fig. 2b). The other profiles in Fig. 2b show a random behavior because after the dissociative adsorption process, the F atoms diffused on the surface.

## 3.4.2. Surface loading at 300 K

We performed a series of simulations at 300 K in which we introduced four F2 molecules into the vacuum region every 5 ps of simulation time. All the fluorine molecules dissociatively adsorbed on the surface mainly yielding surface SF groups. After the diffusion of F atoms, some SF2  moieties were also formed. The final surface structure is shown in Fig. S6. Despite the short simulation time of 20 ps, high fluorine surface coverages of 50 and 70 % were obtained on each surface of MoS2. These results show that the surface can easily reach high coverages at room temperature.

## 3.4.3. Thermal stability of SF, SF2,  and SF3  surface groups

In  order  to  investigate  the  thermal  stability  of  these  groups,  we performed simulations with six SFx moieties within the unit cell (Fig. 3a) in order to have more statistical information. The MD simulations were performed at 100, 300, and 500 K (5 ps at each temperature). The energy profiles for each type of surface structure are shown in Fig. 3b. In the case  of  SF  species,  only  fluorine  diffusion  is  observed  at  the  highest temperature.  SF2 groups  remained  stable  at  all  temperatures  and consequently, the energy profiles at each temperature remained constant (red profile, Fig. 3b). On the other hand, several processes occurred on the MoS2 surface having SF3 groups. An SF3 molecule was desorbed at 5.9 ps (at 300 K) and then another one was desorbed at 10.2 ps (at 500 K). These desorption processes produced a decrease in the energy (green profile in Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c shows a snapshot of the simulation at 11 ps where two SF3 molecules are in the gas phase. Another decrease in the temperature profile was observed at around 12 ps corresponding to the formation of an S2F6 molecule in the gas phase. In summary, out of the six SF3 groups initially present, two of them desorbed, two remained intact,  and  two  decomposed  into  SF2 and  SF  groups.  The  observed decomposition of SF3 groups corresponds to the reverse of Equation (7) (SF3 + S ‚Üí SF + SF2) and is, therefore, an exothermic process with Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.31 eV.

The dynamics of the surface groups are shown in Fig. 4, where we have plotted the √ó and y coordinates of the trajectory of each fluorine atom during 5 ps of simulation time. In the case of SF groups, some F atoms remained on top of S atoms at 100 K, whereas others diffused to the hollow site between the three S atoms (Fig. 4a). As the temperature increases, diffusion between adjacent S atoms occurs, as indicated by the circles in the Figure. As discussed in a previous section, F diffusion between adjacent S atoms has a small barrier of 0.54 eV (at 0.0 K). Fig. 4b shows that the F atoms in SF2 groups rotate around the sulfur atom and they remain stable at all temperatures, which is consistent with the fact that they have the strongest S -F bonds of all surface groups (Section 3.1). The F atoms of the SF3 group remain in fixed positions around the S atom (Fig. 4c). Neither F rotation (as for SF2 groups) nor F diffusion (as for SF groups) is observed. This lack of degrees of freedom in SF3 groups probably explains the fact that as the temperature is increased, the only pathway  for  vibrational  energy  transfer  is  the  desorption  of  the  SF3 moiety (reaction (12)), which is slightly endothermic with Œî E = 0.39 eV.

## 3.4.4. Surface reactivity at 100 % surface coverage

As  outlined  above,  high  fluorine  surface  coverages  are  readily attained  upon  the  reaction  of  F2 molecules  with  the  MoS2 surface. Therefore,  in  this  section,  we  considered  a  100  %  surface  coverage,

which implies one F atom per surface S atom. We started the simulations with  a  configuration  having  24  SF  groups  in  the  unit  cell  (inset  in Fig. 5a). During the first picoseconds of simulation at 100 K, there is a decrease in the energy profile (Fig. 5a) due to the formation of two SF2 groups. At 300 K, an SF3 group was formed whereas at 500 K two new SF2 groups were formed. The trajectory profiles in Fig. 5b -e clearly show the diffusion of F atoms and the formation of SFx groups. Fig. 5f shows the final surface structure after 15 ps of simulation time, having 10 SF groups and 7 SF2 groups. No desorption processes were observed for this surface composition.

Another set of simulations was started from an initial configuration having 6 SF groups and 6 SF3  groups (a total of 24F atoms in the unit cell). When the temperature reached 1000 K (after temperature steps at 100 and 500 K) the surface composition equilibrated to one SF group, 10 SF2 groups, and one SF3 group (structure at 0.0 ps Fig. 6a). At 0.0 K, this surface structure is 4.63 eV more stable than the initial configuration with 24 SF groups (inset in Fig. 5a), since SF2 groups have the strongest S -F bonds, as we discussed previously. At 0.389 ps an SF3 species begins to desorb, and it can be observed in the gas phase in Fig. 6a at 0.697 ps. The sulfur vacancy produced by the desorption of SF3 is filled by an F atom at 1.0 ps which diffuses from an adjacent SF2 group. The F atom on the hollow site between the Mo atoms can be observed in the snapshot at 1.327 ps. As the SF3 molecule in the gas phase approaches the surface at 1.715 ps, it begins to abstract an F atom from an SF group giving rise to an SF4 molecule in the gas phase as shown at 1.922 ps. The final surface composition corresponds to 5 SF groups and 7 SF2 groups and an F atom within a sulfur vacancy, whereas an SF4  molecule was released into the gas phase.

The energy profile in Fig. 6b shows three steps with decreasing energy during the first two ps. The second step of approximately GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2.5 eV corresponds to the filling of the sulfur vacancy with an F atom from an adjacent SF group. The Œî E value for this reaction:

$$\text{uration} \quad S { - F + v a c \to S + F _ { ( v a c ) } }$$

(where vac stands for the sulfur vacancy site) can be calculated from the energetics in Section 3.1. We obtained Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2.48 eV in good agreement with the energy jump observed in Fig. 6b.

To speed up the simulations, we further increased the temperature to 1500 K. We observed the desorption of SF2  groups which leave S-vacancy  sites  on  the  surface  (see  blue  ovals  in  Fig.  7a,  0.402  ps,  and 4.705 ps panels). Two processes occur after the desorption of SF2: the abstraction of F atoms to yield an SF4 molecule (see panels at 0.603 and 6.836 ps) and the filling of the S-vacancy sites by F atoms (see panels at 0.603 and 6.836 ps). At the end of the simulation, the surface contains 8 SF groups and 4F atoms bonded to Mo atoms in S-vacancy sites whereas 3  SF4 molecules  are  desorbed.  The  pronounced  energy  decreases

observed in Fig. 7b correspond to the filling of S vacancy sites with adjacent F atoms which is a very exothermic process (Equation (16)).

## 3.4.5. Surface reactivity for 125 % surface coverage

In another set of calculations, we increased the surface coverage to 125 % by adding 30F atoms to the simulation cell (having 24 S atoms on the surface). After stabilizing the system during 5 ps at 300 K and 5 ps at 500 K, the temperature was raised to 1000 K during 5 ps and then to 1500 K during 15 ps. The energy profiles at 500, 1000, and 1500 K are shown in  Fig.  8a  (black,  orange,  and  blue  profiles,  respectively).  At 1000 K the surface had the following composition: 9 SF, 6 SF2, and 3 SF3

groups. The snapshots in Fig. 8b show that between 5.6 and 5.9 ps, an SF4 molecule is released into the gas phase (initial desorption of the SF3 group which then abstracts an F atom from the surface), and the S vacancy is filled with an F atom. These processes produce a sharp decrease in the energy profile of 6.3 eV (orange curve in Fig. 8a). Then a second SF3  desorbs leaving an S vacancy (snapshot at 9.315 ps). These events also lead to a decrease in the energy profile of around 1.4 eV, which is

not very pronounced because an F atom has not diffused into the vacancy site yet. At 1500 K, the energy profile continuously decreases as the etching of the surface continues. The snapshot at 17.801 ps shows that there are two more SF3  molecules in the gas phase, whereas the sulfur vacancies left by the desorption of these groups are filled with F atoms,  as  shown  in  the  top  view  in  Fig.  8b  at  18.847  ps  (gas-phase species were removed for clarity). At 20.938 ps 4F atoms are coordinated to a Mo atom and as the MoF4 moiety begins to desorb, it abstracts two more F atoms from the surface yielding the MoF6 molecule in the gas phase shown at 21.903 ps. The top view at 25.0 ps shows the etched surface which lacks three S atoms and one Mo, whereas the side view at 25.00 ps shows all the gas phase species produced during this simulation (1 SF5  molecule, 3 SF4  molecules, and 1 MoF6  molecule). In summary, three  sulfur  vacancies  (which  were  rapidly  filled  by  F  atoms)  were

formed around an Mo atom and, upon additional diffusion of F atoms to Mo,  the  MoF6  molecule  desorbed  into  the  gas  phase.  Fig.  S7  shows another example of this mechanism for a simulation in which an MoF5 molecule is desorbed.

During  the  MD  simulations,  the  composition  of  surface  groups changed  with  temperature.  Before  the  occurrence  of  desorption  processes, the fluorinated MoS2 layer was annealed by running simulations every 200 K (1000 steps) down to 100 K, and finally, we performed a geometry optimization (final structures in Fig. S8). Table 1 compares the relative energies for the surface compositions observed in the different simulations (100 % coverage in all cases). The most stable structure has 12 SF2 groups and the structure with 1 SF group, 10 SF2 groups, and 1 SF3 group has virtually the same energy (see Fig. S8). On the other hand, the least stable structure, with 24 SF groups, is 4.63 eV higher in energy. Notably, the latter structure was used in several theoretical works for electronic structure calculations. [25 -27] The general trend observed in Table 1 is that the most stable surfaces have the largest proportion of SF2 groups. This is consistent with the fact that SF2 groups have the strongest S -F bond.

In order to obtain a deeper insight into the etching mechanism of multilayer MoS2, we performed simulations for a MoS2  bilayer where the top layer is fluorinated on both sides as shown in Fig. 9a. We started the simulations with the top layer having a pit originating from 3 S to vacancies sites and 1 Mo vacancy, which is the outcome of the simulation shown in Fig. 8 (see the top view in the panel at 25.000 ps). We assume that the interlayer F atoms are incorporated at grain boundaries or surface pits. The snapshot in Fig. 9a (1500 K) shows that most F atoms are bound to the top layer, and this is more clearly evidenced in the trajectories of F and Mo atoms shown in Fig. 9b (for the sake of clarity, the trajectories of S atoms are not shown). On average, the trajectories of F atoms are closer to the top layer of Mo atoms than to the bottom layer (the red profile shows the trajectory of an F atom that penetrated the layer of S atoms). Fig. 9b shows that most F atoms diffuse freely in the interlayer region at 1500 K. Only the F atoms bound to the S atoms around the pit remain in this position, indicating a stronger SF bonding. Up to around 10 ps, the average interlayer spacing remains constant. Fig. S9 compares the interlayer separation in the absence of F atoms (around 6.5 √Ö) as well as when there are 5 and 12F atoms in the interlayer region (around 7.5 √Ö). However, in the latter case, the interlayer separation  begins  to  increase  after  10  ps  of  simulation  time.  This  is explained by the snapshots shown in Fig. 9c. An SF group within the interlayer  region  around  the  pit  reacts  with  a  diffusing  F  atom  (not shown) giving rise to an SF2  group in the interlayer region (panel at 10.392 ps). As the simulation advances the SF2  molecule abstracts F atoms to become SF3 (panel at 10.602 ps) and SF4 (panel at 13.479 ps) and the interlayer separation keeps increasing as is clearly shown in the panel at 15.567 ps of Fig. 9c. The decreasing energy profile in Fig. 9d indicates that these etching processes are exothermic. The black arrows in Fig. 9d indicate the times at which SF3 and SF4 desorbed from the top layer to the gas phase (not shown) whereas the red arrows indicate the desorption times within the interlayer region. In summary, this simulation shows the mechanisms involved in the etching of the top MoS2

layer,  mainly  triggered  by  the  appearance  of  SFx species  within  the interlayer region.

Experimentally,  the  fluorination  and  subsequent  etching  of  MoS2 have  been  performed  with  XeF2 gas.[22]  The  AIMD  simulations  in Fig. S10 show that the XeF2  molecule dissociatively adsorbs at 300 K yielding an adsorbed Xe atom and two SF groups. The energy change for the  dissociative  adsorption  of  XeF2 was  obtained  from  total  energy calculations at 0.0 K according to the reaction.

$$X e F _ { 2 \, ( g a s ) } + \text{MoS} _ { 2 } \to 2 \, \text{SF} + X e _ { ( a d s ) } \ \Delta E = - 0. 1 6 \, e V \quad \quad ( 1 7 ) \quad \quad \quad$$

which is slightly exothermic, and it is less exothermic than the dissociative adsorption of F2 (Equation (1)) which has Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2.32 eV. This indicates that XeF2  is less reactive than F2. The Xe atom has a small desorption energy of 0.19 eV (Xe (ads) ‚Üí Xe (gas) Œî E = + 0.19 eV), therefore it will readily desorb upon dissociative adsorption of XeF2  molecules.  The  overall  reaction  of  MoS2  with  XeF2  is  expected  to  be  the qualitatively same as with F2, leading to an increased surface coverage of F atoms and formation of SF, SF2, and SF3 groups upon F diffusion, but at a lower rate, due to the lower reactivity of XeF2  toward the MoS2 surface.

## 4. Conclusions

Total energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed at the DFT level to investigate the mechanism of F2-induced MoS2 etching. The MoS2  surface has a high reactivity towards F2  molecules  which  dissociatively  adsorb  at  temperatures  as  low  as  100  K, whereas at 300 K surface coverages up to 70 % were achieved during the short times of AIMD simulations. This high reactivity is explained by the formation of strong S -F bonds after the breakage of the weak F -F bond of F2. The surface chemistry of fluorinated MoS2 is characterized by the presence  of  SF,  SF2, and  SF3 groups  with  different  stabilities  and dynamical behaviors. The most stable surface structures have a majority of  SF2 groups (Table 1). Diffusing F atoms mainly originate from SF groups whereas SF2  groups are the most stable, with the F atoms half rotating around the S atom. On the contrary, the F atoms of SF3 remain rather fixed on the xy plane even at high temperatures and the only pathway for vibrational energy relaxation is the desorption of the SF3 group, in a slightly endothermic process ( Œî E = 0.39 eV). The high stability of SF2 groups is also evidenced in the large Œî E value of 2.08 eV for SF2 desorption (Equation (11)).

MoS2  etching requires a critical surface coverage. At 50 % surface coverage, we did not observe desorption processes, only the diffusion of F  atoms  between  adjacent  S  sites  occurred  at  high  temperatures.  At surface coverages of 100 % and 125 %, the surface is mainly populated by SF2  groups, but desorption processes involved the SF3  groups. The initial  desorption  of  SF3 also  promoted the abstraction of adjacent F atoms when available to yield a gas-phase SF4  molecule. As shown by Equation (13), this reaction is very exothermic with Œî E =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1.11 eV. The sulfur vacancies left by the desorption of SFx species are rapidly filled by F atoms in adjacent SF groups. Equation (16) shows that this reaction is very exothermic ( Œî E = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2.48 eV) and the driving force for this process relies on the fact that the Mo -F bond energy (4.61 eV) is much stronger than the S -F bond energy (2.18 eV) as discussed in section 3.1. The formation  of  a  sulfur  vacancy  induces  the  etching  of  adjacent  sulfur atoms, and this finally promotes the desorption of MoF5 or MoF6 species, thus leaving a surface pit defect (Fig. 8b, panel at 25.000 ps). For a MoS2 bilayer with the top layer fluorinated on both sides, the etching of the top layer was clearly observed as a consequence of the release of SFx species within the interlayer region.

In conclusion, our results help to unveil the main mechanistic steps involved in the etching of MoS2 upon exposure to F2 and provide insights for experimentalists regarding the etching conditions. First, the energetics considerations show that the etching processes can be performed under  mild  experimental  conditions  comprising  room  or  even  lower temperatures. And second, the dynamics of F2 molecules impinging on the surface indicate that most collisions are reactive, thus leading to the dissociative adsorption of F2. This implies that low F2 pressures can be used. Therefore, proper mild temperature and pressure conditions could be found to promote the desorption of fluorinated species in order to induce a controlled layer-by-layer thinning of MoS2.
