## S1. Pair distribution function of amorphous HfO2 bulk model.

Figure S1 shows the pair distribution function (PDF) of amorphous HfO2 bulk model structure quenched at 10 K/ps rate. We are using a unit cell of 216 atoms (72 Hf and 144 O) and the plot uses  300  data  points.  The  different  pairs  are  colour-coded  in  Figure  S1,  with  Hf-O  pairs represented with a red line, Hf-Hf in black and O-O in green. The absence of long-rang range order in our as-quenched hafnia model reflects the amorphous distribution of this solid.

## S2. Mixed  molecular  and  dissociative  adsorption  of  the  HF molecules.

Figure  S2  shows  for  amorphous  HfO2  the  geometries  that  did  not  result  in  complete dissociation of the HF molecules.

Figure S2. Relaxed geometries for different HF coverages of amorphous HfO2 where a mixture of molecular and dissociative adsorption of HF is observed. (a) 2HF A, (b) 3HF A, (c) 4HF A (d) 4HF C, (e) 5HF C, (f) 8HF A, (g) 8HF B, (h) 8HF C, (i) 16HF A, (j) 16HF B, (k) 28HF, (l) 30HF, (m) 32 HF and (n) 34 HF. The colour coding is brown = Hf, red = O, white = H and blue = F.

## S3. Explanation of error bar.

The ± 0.3 error is defined by the following, 4 F atoms leads to the etching of 1 Hf atom so the coverage of Hf that can be etched is 0.25 of the F coverage (round to 0.3). This was based on a similar analysis from where 3 F atoms leads to the etching of 1 Al atom so the coverage of Al that can be etched is 0.33 of the Al coverage (round to 0.3). 1,2
