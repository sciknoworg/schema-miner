## SI. Surface Fluxes and Impact Fluences Calculations

1. Cl2 molecules at 300K. Wall collision flux (gas kinetic theory) = ¼ nCl2 vmean

ni=Pi/kT ideal gas law; Pi = partial pressure species i

vmean (m/s; gas kinetic theory) = (8 kT/p mi) 0.5 ; mi = molecular mass (kg); kT (J)

mCl2 = (70.1 g/mole)(1 mole/6.02 x 10 23 molecules) = 11.6 x 10 -23 g = 11.6 x 10 -26 Kg

k = 1.38 x 10 -23 J/K

kT = 4.14 x 10 -21 J

vmean = [(8 x 4.14 x 10 -21 J)/(3.14159 x 11.6 x 10 -26 Kg)] 0.5 = 301 m/s = 3 x 10 4  cm/s

At T = 300K, 20 mTorr pressure total; if Cl2 is 20/100 or 1/5 of total pressure (1 Pa/7.5mT) x 20 mT x 1/9 = 0.53 Pa

Ideal gas law: nCl2 = PCl2/kT = 0.53 Pa/(4.14 x 10 -21 J) = 1.3 x 10 20 m -3 = 1.3 x 10 14 cm -3

Cl2 flux = ¼ nCl2 vmean = ¼ (1.3 x 10 14 cm -3 ) (3 x 10  cm/s) = 4 9.8 x 10 17 cm -2 s -1

2. Ar + flux = 3.7 x 10 16 cm -2 s -1

Average surface impact times for surface area of 10  A  = 10 3 2 -13 cm 2

Cl2 molecules: t Cl2 ~ 1/(area x flux) = 1/[10 -13 cm 2 x 5.3 x 10 17 cm -2 s -1 ] = 0.02 ms = 20 ms

Ar + :

t Ar+ ~ 1/(area x flux) = 1/[10 -13 cm 2 x 3.7 x 10 16 cm -2 s -1 ] = 0.27 ms = 270 ms

## SII. Cl Surface Coverage of MD Simulations Using Additional Exposure

Figure S1 gives the Cl uptake as a function of cycle number for a simulation using a longer Cl2 exposure period relative than those mentioned in the main text. Note that the Cl uptake saturates around a value of 1 × 10 15 Cl/cm 2 , similar to what was seen in the main text. Therefore, a larger Cl2 fluence would not change the results of the MD simulations.

Figure S1 : Cl uptake as a function of cycle number for a MD simulation using a longer Cl2 exposure period when compared to those mentioned in the main text. The Cl2 fluence for this simulation is 1.88 × 10 17 Cl2 molecules/cm  or roughly 188 ML of Cl2 molecules. The Ar  ion 2 + energy is 80 eV. Note we only show Cl uptake after the simulation has reached cyclic steady state.
