## S1. Self-limiting surface models

We model by hand the self-limiting surfaces for the thermochemical calculations by removing a surface oxygen and replacing it with two fluorine atoms on HfO 2 and ZrO . The top layer 2 of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 in Figures 1 and 2 have 16 Hf/Zr and 16 O atoms that can be used to model a fluorinated self-limiting surface. Self-limiting models are created for three different O:F product states by removing 16, 12 and 8 O and replacing with 32, 24 and 16 F atoms, Figures 3 and 4.

## S2. Binding sites of 1 HF Molecule at HfO 2 and ZrO 2

We introduced one HF molecule approximately 3 Å from the bare surfaces of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 at three different binding sites. In Figures 5 and 6 we see binding sites A a, B b and C c where the uppercase letter represents the Hf/Zr-F bond and the lowercase latter represents the O-H bond. From the relaxed geometries of HF adsorption at the A, B and C sites of HfO , the coordination number (c.n) of each oxygen atom, which forms the O-H bond, is 2 2 (excluding the H bond) and of each hafnium atom, which forms Hf-F bond, is 6 (excluding the F bond). Similarly, at the A and B sites of ZrO , the c.n of each oxygen atom is 2 2 (excluding the H bond) and at site C it is 3 (excluding the H bond). Also the c.n for each zirconium atom bonded to fluorine is 6 (excluding the F bond). For site C of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 the resulting relaxation geometries for the O-H bond are at different surface oxygen due to the HF molecules having different orientations at the initial geometry before relaxation.

## S6. HF addition energy

An exponential function (f(x) = Ae -Bx + C) was fitted to the binding energy vs HF coverage plots (b) in Figures 11 and 12. The derivative of that fit ( d dx f(x) = ABe -Bx ) gives the rate of change of the binding energy with respect to increasing HF coverage which is the HF addition energy. The surface is saturated when the derivative becomes zero. As the number of HF added increases the HF addition energy decreases.
