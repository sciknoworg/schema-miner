Atomic Layer Deposition of Hafnium Dioxide Films from
Hafnium Tetrakis(ethylmethylamide) and Water**
By Kaupo Kukli,* Mikko Ritala, Timo Sajavaara, Juhani Keinonen, and Markku Leskelä
HfO2 films were produced from Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 and H2O, on borosilicate glass, indium-tin-oxide (ITO), and Si(100) substrates, in the temperature range 150±325 C, using atomic layer deposition (ALD). In the temperature range 200±250 C, the
growth rate of the HfO2 films was 0.09 nm per cycle, but increased with both increasing and decreasing temperatures. The
self-limiting adsorption of Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 at 250 C was verified. The films were stoichiometric dioxides with an O/Hf
ratio of 2.0 ± 0.1. The concentrations of residual carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen, determined using ion beam analysis, were
0.3±0.6 at.-%, 0.1±0.2 at.-%, and 2±3 at.-%, respectively. The films crystallized at growth temperatures exceeding 150±175 C,
and consisted mainly of the monoclinic HfO2 phase. The refractive index of the films varied between 2.08 and 2.10. The effective permittivities of the HfO2 films grown in the temperature range 200±300 C varied between 11 and 14.

1. Introduction
HfO2 is a potential candidate for several applications
such as high-permittivity dielectric oxide in metal oxide
semiconductor (MOS) devices,[1±3] thin film capacitors,[4]
gas-sensing devices,[5] tunnel junctions,[6] and laser damageresistant optical coatings.[7] The maximum dielectric constant value for HfO2 (30) may exceed that of ZrO2 (25),[8]
another prospective candidate for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) gate oxides.[3] However, relatively low values (15.7 ± 0.5, measured at
100 kHz) of the dielectric constant have been reported for
HfO2 films.[9] The optical energy gap is reported to be
higher in HfO2, compared to ZrO2.[5,10] The refractive index of HfO2 films is in the range 2.08±2.15,[7±9,11] slightly
lower than that of ZrO2 (2.2).[8]
HfO2 thin films have often been grown using physical
vapor deposition methods, such as sputtering or e-beam
evaporation,[6±9,12±15] while in the CVD routes to HfO2
films, b-diketonate precursors have been exploited.[16,17] In
recent studies, the use of hafnium nitrate, Hf(NO3)4,[1,18]

and hafnium tetrakis(diethylamide), Hf[N(C2H5)2]4,[19,20]
were described.
Hafnium halides, especially HfCl4, have been the common Hf precursors in the ALD process. In ALD, a substrate surface is alternately exposed to highly reactive
metal and oxygen precursors, and the solid film forms as a
result of successive surface reactions between (sub)monolayers of precursor molecules alternately adsorbed. HfCl4
and H2O have been applied to grow binary HfO2,[2,11,21,22]
or HfO2-Ta2O5 nanolaminate films.[4,23] Recently, HfI4 and
H2O-H2O2 have also been applied in an ALD process.[24]
The permittivity of the 150±170 nm thick films grown from
HfCl4 and H2O at 325 C on ITO substrates was 16, measured at 10 kHz.[23] The refractive index of ALD HfO2
films was 2.10, measured at 580 nm.[11] Gordon et al.[25]
have noted that it is possible to grow HfO2 films in ALD
mode from hafnium tetrakis(dimethylamide), and H2O,
with a growth rate of 0.1 nm per cycle. However, the properties of these films were not described. It is to be noted
that the reproducibility of HfO2 capacitors grown from
HfCl4 may sometimes suffer from particle transport, originating from the hafnium precursor,[11] therefore the exploitation of liquid precursors, ensuring uniform precursor
delivery, is recommended.
In the present study, HfO2 films were grown by ALD
from a novel hafnium precursor, hafnium tetrakis(ethylmethylamide), and H2O in order to investigate the basic
features of the film growth in this new precursor combination. The dependence of the growth rate on the substrate
temperature and ALD cycle time parameters was investigated. In addition, the effect of substrate temperature on
the film structure and composition will be described. Preliminary results on the dielectric properties of the films
grown at various temperatures will be reported.

The length of the Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 pulse was varied

Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 adsorption. Figure 1 shows that a

observed for greater pulse lengths. It can also be seen that
the refractive index of the resulting films reaches maximum
value in the Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 pulse length range
0.4±0.6 s, while increasing the pulse length somewhat reduces the refractive index. This can arise from the thermal
decomposition of Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4, which may become
more significant during longer exposure times, slightly
reducing the film density or changing the film composition.
It is to be noted that the changes in refractive index are
very small, although clearly measurable. In most of the
depositions, the Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 pulse length was 0.4 s.

uniform thickness over a large substrate area. Somewhat
decreased uniformity can be observed at 275 C and above,
very possibly indicating an increasing effect of the thermal
decomposition of Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4. It is to be noted
that HfO2 films of similar uniformity can be grown by
ALD from HfCl4 and H2O at 500 C,[11] but the application
of lower growth temperatures in the case of HfCl4 has resulted in a stronger thickness profile exceeding 10±15 %
deviations over the substrate.

pendent of the growth temperature. In this range, the
adsorption of Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 molecules may be
expected to be a self-limiting process during 0.4 s long precursor pulses. In the case of self-limitation and absence of
thermal decomposition, adsorption proceeds until all the
reactive, functional groups on the surface (such as ±OH
groups) are used up.
A separate experiment was carried out to examine the
thermal decomposition of the hafnium precursor.
Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 was pulsed 1500±2750 times with a
pulse length of 0.6 s and without an intermittent hydrolysis
step, i.e., a water pulse. At 205 C, film growth was negligible. At 250 C, ultrathin, brownish layers of unknown composition were formed on the glass substrates, indicating
weak thermal decomposition. Thus, the growth cannot be
expected to be perfectly self-limiting. The increase in
growth rate at lower temperatures may be due to the increased density of functional adsorption sites (±OH
groups) or the molecular adsorption of the precursor. At
higher temperatures, the growth rate can be enhanced by
intense thermal decomposition of the hafnium precursor.
The growth rate of the films in the present study increases rather rapidly from 0.09 nm per cycle at 250 C to
0.15 nm per cycle at 325 C, while the growth rate reported
for the Hf[N(CH3)2]4 and H2O precursors[25] was about
0.1 nm per cycle in the temperature range 250±350 C. The
difference in growth rates may be connected, no only to
the properties of Hf precursors, but also to differences in

2.2. Film Structure
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate selected X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the HfO2 films deposited at varying
temperatures on glass and silicon substrates, respectively.
Because the intensity of the diffraction peaks is generally
higher, it can be seen that the films grown at relatively high
temperatures are more crystalline. Otherwise, no particular
differences between the phase contents of the films grown
on both types of substrate were observed. In the films
grown on ITO, the dominant peaks belonged to the 111
and 111 reflections of the monoclinic phase[27] (not shown),
whereas on Si substrates, the most intense reflections (such
as 020 and 200), were essentially weaker in the films grown
on ITO. The monoclinic HfO2 phase was predominant in
all the films, except those grown below 200 C, where the
temperature was obviously too low to initiate noticeable
crystallization (Fig. 4). In the films grown on silicon, trace
reflections from tetragonal or orthorhombic phases were
also detected at a 2H value of 30.4 (Fig. 5). This is characteristic of ALD HfO2 since similar minor reflections from
metastable phases were also seen in the films grown from
HfCl4 and H2O.[11,21,22]
Three films, grown at 200 C, 250 C, and 300 C, were
evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM
measurements revealed that the root-mean-square (rms)
roughness of the film surface was 7.9 ± 0.4 nm, 4.6 ±
0.4 nm, and 3.7 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. The respective film
thicknesses were 132 nm, 132 nm, and 170 nm. This is an
interesting result because the roughness actually decreased
with the increase in the deposition temperature, although,
simultaneously, the crystallinity increased with the growth
temperature (Fig. 5). From the AFM images of the samples
grown at 200 C and 300 C in Figure 6, it can be seen that

gas flow rate and processing time parameters, depending
on the reactor used. In terms of precursor properties,
Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 is more volatile than Hf[N(CH3)2]4,
but can also be somewhat less stable at higher temperatures. However, considering the interatomic distances in
HfO2 (0.2086±0.2197 nm for Hf±O and 0.3547±0.3386 nm
for Hf±Hf)[26] as well as the lattice parameters,[27] it is still
obvious that the average growth rate remains below one
monolayer of hafnium oxide.
The refractive index of HfO2, measured in this study,
agrees with the literature values.[7±9,13±15] From Figure 3, it
can be seen that the maximum values of refractive index
coincide with the region of temperature-independent
growth rate, whereas too low or too high temperatures are
likely to result in films of reduced density or changed
composition, as well as decreased refractive index. It is still
important to mention that the changes in refractive index
values are really small, therefore no substantial changes in
film quality are expected over the whole temperature range
studied.

the grain size decreases considerably with the growth temperature, resulting in reduced roughness. This may be due
to the increased nucleation density at 300 C. At the same
time, neither crystal size (possibly increasing with temperature and larger in the film bulk), nor film thickness affected
the surface smoothness.

2.3. Film Composition
According to time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA), the hafnium and oxygen concentrations
were 33 ± 2 at.-% and 63 ± 2 at.-%, respectively, in the
films grown in the temperature range 175±300 C. Thus the
oxygen to hafnium ratio in these samples was 2.0 ± 0.1. In
the films grown at 150 C and 325 C, the hafnium and oxygen concentrations were 30 ± 2 at.-% and 63 ± 3 at.-%,
respectively. Within the accuracy limits of TOF-ERDA, all
the samples were evidently stoichiometric dioxides.

in the HfO2 films as a function of growth temperature. In
the films grown below 275 C, carbon and nitrogen levels
remained in the ranges 0.3±0.6 at.-% and 0.1±0.2 at.-%,

Zirconium is the common impurity in hafnium-based compounds and hafnium precursors.
For comparison, Ohshita et al.[19] obtained sub-stoichiometric oxides from Hf[N(C2H5)2]4 and O2 in a CVD process, where the O/Hf ratio was 1.5 at a deposition temperature of 300 C. Stoichiometric dioxides could be obtained
at 350 C. At 300 C, the carbon impurities were strongly
dependent on the O2 dose and varied between 1 at.-% and
11 at.-%. Nitrogen content remained at the 5±7 at.-% level. Evidently, the precursors, Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 and H2O,
used in the ALD process in this study, enable the deposition of stoichiometric HfO2 at lower temperatures than so
far reported for alkylamide-based CVD.

grown at both lower and higher temperatures. Generally,
the contaminants were distributed homogeneously
throughout the film thickness. In some samples, a hydrogen
peak was detected at the film surface, possibly coming from
adsorbed water. Zirconium was also found in all of the

Some capacitor structures were fabricated in order to
verify the dielectric behavior of HfO2 films grown in this
study. Figure 8 demonstrates capacitance±voltage (CV)
and dissipation behavior, measured at 500 kHz, for the
films deposited at 200 C on HF-etched Si, and at 300 C on
a Si substrate with a ca. 1.1 nm thick chemically grown
SiO2 overlayer. The film thicknesses were 133 nm and
178 nm, respectively, and the films were not heat treated
before measurements. All the CV curves demonstrated
counterclockwise hysteresis when swept from positive to
negative bias forward, and from negative to positive bias
backwards.
The flat-band voltage in typical Al/HfO2/Si capacitors remains at ±1 V. The CV curves exhibited a shift in flat-band
voltage towards positive bias (Fig. 8) during the forward
sweep. This is due to the intense injection of negative
charge from the substrate under positive bias. The hysteresis width is noticeably larger in the films grown at lower
temperature. This may be due to the (assumed to be) thinner SiO2 interface layer, but perhaps also to the more
homogeneous nature (i.e., crystalline phase dominating

over an amorphous phase) of the film grown at 300 C. The
hysteresis width can be estimated using the difference between dissipation maxima occurring near flat-band conditions. The density of the oxide rechargeable traps may then
be calculated from the hysteresis width.[28] For the CV
curves depicted in Figure 8, one obtains the oxide trap densities 1.1  1012 cm±2 and 4.0  1012 cm±2 for the films grown
at 300 C and 200 C, respectively.
The CV curves exhibit clear accumulation under strongly
negative bias voltage. The effective permittivity of the dielectric oxide layer(s) can be calculated from the accumulation capacitance by using the simple parallel plate capacitor
model. This gives effective permittivity values of 11.3 ± 0.5
and 14.5 ± 0.5 for the HfO2 films grown at 200 C and
300 C, respectively. In the latter case, the effect of the
1.1 nm SiO2 interface layer has been taken into account by
using the series connection of parallel plate capacitors with
SiO2 and HfO2 dielectric layers.
The permittivity values calculated for the Al/HfO2/ITO
capacitors compared favorably with the effective permittivities of the films on silicon. The sample films were deposited on ITO at arbitrarily chosen temperatures of 205 C
and 250 C. The corresponding film thicknesses were
135 nm and 127 nm. The respective permittivities were
12.3 ± 0.3 and 14.0 ± 0.1, independent of the measurement
frequency (varied between 10 kHz and 500 kHz).
The current±voltage behavior of these capacitors was
also examined. The leakage current density versus
electric field curves (not shown) demonstrated that the
current density remained below 1  10±5 A cm±2 until the
dielectric breakdown. Typically, the breakdown occurred
at 2.5±2.6 MV cm±1 and 2.8±2.9 MV cm±1 in the Al/HfO2/
ITO capacitors with dielectric layers grown at 250 C and
205 C, respectively. The difference in the breakdown
resistance in the films grown at higher temperature can
be explained by somewhat higher polycrystallinity and
some contribution from the grain boundary conductivity.
In the Al/HfO2/Si capacitors, the breakdown occurred at
3.5 MV cm±1 and 3.7 MV cm±1 with dielectric layers
grown at 200 C and 300 C. At 300 C, the film was
grown onto 1.1 nm SiO2 formed on Si(100) and this can give
rise to breakdown resistance. In these particular samples, the
pre-breakdown leakage current was between 1  10±6 A cm±2
and 1  10±5 A cm±2 in the field range 2.0±3.5 MV cm±1
measured for the film grown at 200 C, whereas for the film
grown at 300 C, the pre-breakdown current remained
between 1  10±7 A cm±2 and 5  10±7 A cm±2 in the electric
field range 2.0±3.7 MV cm±1. More detailed study on the
dielectric properties is beyond the scope of the present
paper. Possible formation and effect of interface layers on
HF-etched Si, as well as its increase during deposition
and storage in ambient air, remains a matter for future
investigation. Further, the effect of growth and annealing
temperatures, film thickness, and structure on the permittivity and interface quality should also be studied.

3. Summary
Stoichiometric HfO2 films can be grown by ALD from
Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 and H2O in the temperature range
150±325 C. The adsorption of Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 is a
self-limiting process, as confirmed at 250 C. In the temperature range 200±250 C, the film growth is quite independent of the growth temperature. The growth rate and residual hydrogen contamination increase towards both lower
and higher temperatures outside this range. The hydrogen
concentration at 200±500 C was 2±3 at.-%. The carbon
and nitrogen concentrations were 0.3±0.6 at.-% and 0.1±
0.2 at.-%, respectively, increasing somewhat with the deposition temperature. The films crystallize when growing at
temperatures exceeding 150±175 C. The refractive index
of the HfO2 films grown on glass substrates was 2.08±2.10.
The dominant phase in the films is monoclinic HfO2 with a
somewhat preferred (020) texture on Si(100) and glass, and
with most intense 111 and (111) orientations when grown
on polycrystalline ITO. The effective permittivities of
HfO2 in Al/HfO2/Si capacitor structures were 11.3 and
14.5, measured for the films grown at 200 C and 300 C,
respectively. The permittivities of HfO2 in Al/HfO2/ITO
capacitor structures were 12.3 and 14.0, measured for the
films grown at 205 C and 250 C, respectively. The breakdown in HfO2 films occurred at 2.6±2.9 MV cm±1 in the
films grown on ITO, and at 3.53.7 MV cm±1 in the films
grown on Si.

4. Experimental
The films were grown in a hot-wall horizontal flow-type ALD reactor
[29] onto borosilicate glass, Si(100), and glass substrates covered by patterned ITO electrodes. The substrate temperature was varied in the range
150±325 C. The pressure in the reactor was about 10 mbar. Hf[N(CH3)(C2H5)]4 [30] (Aldrich, 99.99+ %, product number 553 123) was evaporated
from an open boat at 60 C inside the reactor. H2O vapor was generated in
an external reservoir at room temperature and led into the reactor through
needle and solenoid valves. Metal precursor pulse length was varied
between 0.2 s and 1.0 s, while the water pulse length was held at 0.5 s. Constant purge times of 0.5 s were used after each precursor pulse to separate
the precursor flows in the gas phase and to remove the excess reactants and
gaseous reaction by-products from the system. Nitrogen was used as both
precursor carrier and purge gas.
The film thickness and optical properties were calculated from optical
transmission spectra [31] measured by a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer.
The structure of the films was determined by means of a Philips MPD 1880
powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation and the Bragg±Brentano geometry. The surface roughness of some selected samples was evaluated
using a ThermoMicroscopes CP Research AFM. The film composition and
residual contamination level were evaluated by TOF-ERDA [32]. A
53 MeV 127I10+ beam for TOF-ERDA was obtained from a 5 MV tandem
accelerator EGP-10-II, and forward scattered iodine ions and recoiled target
atoms were used for the determination of Hf and lighter elements, respectively. Dielectric properties were measured after e-beam evaporation of aluminum electrodes with an effective electrode area of 0.204 mm2. After film
deposition, the reverse of the silicon substrates were etched in hydrofluoric
acid and metallized by evaporating a 100 nm thick Al layer. Thus, the electrical measurements were carried out on Al/HfO2/p-Si(100)/Al, Al/HfO2/
SiO2/p-Si(100)/Al, or Al/HfO2/ITO capacitor structures. CV curves were recorded using a HP 4284A precision LCR meter. The stair-sweep voltage
step was 0.05 V, and the period between voltage steps was 0.5 s. The AC

voltage applied to the capacitor was 0.05 V or 0.005 V while the frequency
of the AC signal was held at either 100 kHz or 500 kHz. The current±voltage curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter in the stairsweep voltage mode, while the voltage step used was 0.02±0.05 V. All measurements were carried out at room temperature.
