Platinum thin films were grown at 300 °C by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using
(methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum (MeCpPtMe 3) and oxygen as precursors. The
films had excellent uniformity, low resistivity, and low-impurity contents. Structural studies
by X-ray diffraction showed that the films were strongly (111) oriented. Growth rates of
0.45 Å cycle-1 were obtained wit h 4 s total cycle times. The film thickness was found to
linearly depend on the number of the reaction cycles. Also, the possible reaction mechanism
is discussed.
Introduction
Noble metals and their conducting oxides are poten-
tial metallization materials for microelectronic applica-
tions. Platinum is a potential capacitor electrode ma-
terial for dynamic random access memories (DRAMs)
because of its high chemical stability in an oxidizing
atmosphere and its excellent electrical properties.1,2 A
deposition process producing highly conformal platinum
films is, however, needed when fabricating three-
dimensional storage nodes. Platinum is also applicable
as a gate metal in the future metal-oxide-semiconductor
field effect transistors (MOSFETs) because of its high
work function (5.6 eV).3
Platinum thin films can be deposited by physical
vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) techniques. Films deposited by CVD usually have
better conformality than films deposited by PVD and
therefore CVD is preferred when conformal platinum
films are needed. Precursors such as CpPtMe3 (Cp )
cyclopentadienyl),4,5 MeCpPtMe3,2,5-8 Pt(acac)2 (acac )
acetylacetonate),9,10 and Pt(hfa) 2 (hfa ) hexafluoro-
acetylacetonate)11,12 are, for example, available for CVD
of platinum thin films. MeCpPtMe3 is a widely studied
CVD precursor because of its low melting point of 30
°C.6 Both hydrogen5,6 and oxygen2,7,8 have been used for
decomposing the ligands of the MeCpPtMe 3. Although
CVD has been shown to be capable of producing high-
quality platinum films, atomic layer deposition (ALD)13-15
would be an attractive alternative as it could show
significant advantages such as perfect conformality and
good large area uniformity of the films.16 These proper-
ties gain increasing importance as the dimensions of the
surface structures to be covered decrease.
ALD can be considered as a special modification of
CVD. The main difference to the conventional CVD is
that in ALD the precursors are introduced to the reactor
in alternate pulses that are separated by inert gas
purging. The film growth proceeds in a layer-by-layer
manner; that is, maximally one monolayer, but usually
less, is formed during each growth cycle. The film
growth is controlled by saturative precursor chemisorp-
tion on the growth surface or by saturative reactions of
the precursor with reactive surface groups making the
process self-limiting. As far as the surface saturation
is achieved, the process is insensitive to small changes
in the precursor doses, thus simplifying also the use of
solid precursors. The thickness of the deposited films
can be controlled accurately simply by the number of
growth cycles applied.
There are only a few studies on noble metal deposition
by ALD. Platinum film deposition by ALD has been
studied by using Pt(acac)2 and hydrogen as precursors.17

However, Pt(acac) 2 was found to be an unsuitable
precursor for ALD due to its thermal decomposition at
low temperatures. Sufficient thermal stability is re-
quired for the ALD precursors since thermal decomposi-
tion of the precursors destroys the self-limiting growth
mechanism. The physical state of the precursor, on the
other hand, is not of great importance since also solid
precursors can easily be used in ALD. Recently, we
successfully deposited ruthenium thin films by ALD.18
The films showed excellent conformality and uniformity
as characteristic to ALD. In that process the ligands of
the ruthenium precursor were oxidatively decomposed
by oxygen. In the present study, a similar process has
been developed for deposition of platinum by ALD. In
this paper we report the deposition of platinum from
(methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum [MeCpPt-
Me3, (CH3C5H4)Pt(CH3)3] and oxygen.
Experimental Section
The films were deposited in a flow-type F-120 ALD reactor
(ASM Microchemistry Ltd.) operated under a pressure of about
10 mbar. Nitrogen (99.9995%) generated by a NITROX UHPN
3000 nitrogen generator was used as a carrier and purging
gas. About 2-nm-thick amorphous Al2O3 film was deposited
by ALD from AlCl 3 and water on 5  5 cm borosilicate glass
substrates right before the platinum deposition. Platinum films
were grown also directly on borosilicate and on silicon with
native oxide. The solid platinum precursor MeCpPtMe3 (Strem
Chemicals) was evaporated from an open boat held at room
temperature inside the reactor. Because MeCpPtMe3 is air-
sensitive, it was loaded to the boat in a glovebox and was only
shortly exposed to air while transferring the boat into the
reactor. Air as an oxygen source was pulsed into the reactor
through a needle valve and a solenoid valve with a flow rate
of 40 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) during a
continuous flow. The MeCpPtMe3 pulse time was varied
between 0.2 and 1.5 s and the air pulse time between 1.0 and
3.0 s. The purge times used in the experiments were 1.0 and
2.0 s.
Film morphology was studied by a Zeiss DSM 962 scanning
electron microscope (SEM) and film thickness was determined
by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) using a Link
ISIS EDX spectrometer installed to the SEM equipment. The
error in the thickness measurement was estimated to be(5%.
The EDX results were analyzed using a GMR electron probe
thin-film microanalysis program.19 Platinum bulk density (21.5
gc m -3) was used in the thickness calculations. Since the
density of the deposited films is very likely to be lower than
the bulk density, the actual film thicknesses probably are
somewhat higher. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also
used for surface morphology studies. The measurements were
carried out in tapping mode using a ThermoMicroscopes Auto-
Probe CP Research AFM. The root-mean-square (RMS) values
were obtained from 10 10 ím scans using the software of
the microscope. The impurity contents in the platinum films
were analyzed by time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis
(TOF-ERDA)20,21 using 58-MeV 127I11+ ions. The crystal struc-
ture of the films was determined using a Bruker AXS D8
advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu KR radiation.
The film resistivity was calculated from the sheet resistance
measured by the standard four-point probe method and from
the film thickness determined by the EDX analysis.
Results and Discussion
First, the optimal deposition temperature was se-
lected. Uniform and mirrorlike platinum films were
obtained at 300 and 350 °C. There were, however,
platinum deposits on the walls of the platinum precur-
sor inlet tube after the growth experiments at 350 °C,
indicating that the platinum precursor was thermally
decomposing. At 300 °C still some platinum was depos-
ited in the inlet tube but to a much lesser extent than
that at 350 °C. Extensive thermal decomposition of the
precursors must be avoided in ALD because it destroys
the self-limiting growth mechanism and therefore 300
°C can be considered to be close to the upper limit for
the deposition temperature in this process. On the other
hand, since only very thin films were obtained at 250
°C, the deposition temperature of 300 °C was used in
further experiments.
Figure 1 shows the effect of the precursor pulse times
on the film growth rate. As the MeCpPtMe3 pulse time
is increased from 0.2 s, the growth rate slightly in-
creases and saturates to 0.48 Å cycle-1 with pulse times
longer than 0.5 s. Saturation is also observed with air
pulse times longer than 1.5 s. The self-limiting growth
mechanism is thus reasonably well verified, even if a
minor effect of thermal decomposition of MeCpPtMe3
cannot be completely excluded. Figure 2 shows that the
film thickness depends linearly on the number of
reaction cycles, that is, the growth rate remains con-
stant through the process. However, the growth rate
may be lower during the nucleation of the platinum film

on the Al2O3 surface at the beginning of the film growth,
which could explain why the extrapolated line in Figure
2 does not go through the origin. On the other hand,
this deviation is inside the error limits of the thickness
determination.
The uniformity of the films was excellent. Thickness
variation of films grown with short and long MeCpPt-
Me3 pulses of 0.2 and 1.5 s, respectively, are shown in
Figure 3. Since the MeCpPtMe 3 pulse time of 0.2 s is
not within the saturated growth rate range, the film is
thinner than the film grown with a MeCpPtMe3 pulse
time of 1.5 s. The thickness profiles of the films are,
however, quite similar. The uniformity of the films
further support the self-limiting growth mechanism
since extensive self-decomposition of MeCpPtMe3 would
cause the film to be significantly thicker at the leading
edge of the substrate.
All the films were polycrystalline metallic platinum
as examined by XRD. A typical diffractogram showing
the preferred (111) orientation is presented in Figure
4a. A rocking curve of the (111) reflection (Figure 4b)
has a clear maximum with a full-width at half-
maximum (fwhm) of 13°. The curve is asymmetric
because the volume of the film being illuminated is
larger at small incoming angles. The preferred (111)
orientation is typical for the face-centered cubic (fcc)
metals and has been reported also for CVD-grown
platinum films.8,12 Since the growth rate (40 nm h-1)o f
the ALD platinum films is relatively low, the platinum
atoms have enough time to migrate on the surface and
to arrange in the (111) orientation with the lowest
surface energy.
While the films were macroscopically uniform, the
SEM images in Figure 5 show that the surface rough-
ness and the grain size increase with increasing film
thickness. AFM measurements verify the changes in the
surface morphology (Figure 6) and show that the RMS
values of the films increase from 4.0( 0.4 nm for the
50-nm film to 17( 1 nm for the 110-nm film. The higher
RMS value of the thicker film is due to the large grains
that cover most of the surface while substantially
smaller grains cover the rest of the surface. The change
in the surface morphology suggests that in the thicker
film some of the initially formed grains have grown at
the expense of the others. The relatively long pulse and
purge times used in the experiments may further
promote the grain growth.
Adhesion of the platinum films was studied on bare
borosilicate glass, on borosilicate with a thin Al2O3 layer,
and on silicon with a native oxide layer. All the films
were uniform and specular but adhesion of the films on
these substrates was modest. The films did not peel off
from the substrate but they did not pass the routine tape
test. The ruthenium films grown by ALD in our previous
study18 instead adhered well to Al 2O3 and ruthenium
could therefore be used as an adhesion layer for
platinum. Ruthenium has a higher tendency to oxida-
tion, which could explain the better adhesion of ruthe-
nium on a freshly deposited oxide surface.
The impurity contents of the platinum films were low
as analyzed by TOF-ERDA. The amounts of all impuri-
ties decreased as the air pulse time increased. When
the air pulse time was increased from 1.0 to 2.0 s, the
maximum hydrogen content decreased from 1.0 to 0.5
at. %, the maximum carbon content from 1.0 to 0.5 at.
%, and the maximum oxygen content from 2.0 to 1.0 at.
%. The results show that the ligands of the MeCpPtMe3
molecule are more effectively removed with long oxygen
pulses. The low oxygen content of the films verifies that
platinum is not oxidized during the process.
The resistivity of the platinum films was low and it
decreased with increasing film thickness. A 110-nm
platinum film had a resistivity of 12í¿-cm that is only
slightly higher than the bulk value (10.8í¿-cm). Since
the actual thickness of the films is probably higher than
the thickness values obtained by using the bulk density
of platinum, the actual resitivities of the films are also
slightly higher. Still, the resistivities of the ALD plati-
num films are very low as compared to the resistivity
values of 13-30 í¿-cm measured for the platinum films
grown by CVD at the same temperatures. 2,8,12 The low

distances from the leading edge of the substrate, that is, the

resistivities of the ALD platinum films are probably due
to a high degree of crystallization and low-impurity
contents.
The following reaction mechanism has been proposed
for the oxidative decomposition of MeCpPtMe 3 in the
temperature range of 200-350 °C in the respective CVD
process:2
The Pt-Ox species represents oxygen that is adsorbed
on the platinum surface. 2 Surface studies have shown
that at ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions oxygen
atomically adsorbs on the platinum surface already at
room temperature.22-24 The adsorbed oxygen atoms
participate in surface reactions at temperatures below
530 °C and a subsurface layer of nonreactive oxygen is
formed only at temperatures higher than 530 °C.22,25
Oxygen desorption from a platinum surface starts at a
temperature of 330 °C. 24,26 Therefore, it is likely that
an adsorbed oxygen layer is formed on the platinum
surface during the air pulse and that the adsorbed
oxygen layer is stable during the purge period in the
ALD process. We suggest that during the following
MeCpPtMe3 pulse the ligands react with the adsorbed
oxygen layer, liberating CO 2,H 2O, and possibly other
byproducts as presented in eq 2. However, because of
the limited amount of oxygen in the adsorption layer,
the ligands may not be completely oxidized. The re-
maining hydrocarbon species are then oxidized during
the following air pulse. After complete oxidation of the
ligands, a new layer of adsorbed oxygen should thus
form on the platinum surface. This cycle is then
repeated during the film growth. Preliminary in situ
studies with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS)
revealed that the reaction byproducts CO2 and H2O are
released during both MeCpPtMe 3 and oxygen pulses.
These observations are consistent with the above-
presented reaction mechanism.
In conclusion, polycrystalline platinum thin films
having low resistivity were grown by ALD at 300 °C
using MeCpPtMe3 and oxygen as precursors. Reason-
ably good saturation with respect to both precursors was
achieved and the film thickness was found to depend
linearly on the number of growth cycles applied. The
uniformity of the films was excellent, but adhesion to
the underlying oxide film was only modest. The impurity
contents of the films were low.
