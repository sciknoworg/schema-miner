Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of titanium dioxide from TiCl 4 and H2O was studied at substrate temperatures of 100–
4008C. Using a real-time quartz crystal microbalance method, it was demonstrated that although the surface reactions were
self-limited, the growth rate depended on the temperature and development of the thin ﬁlm structure. Relatively low growth
rate which was obtained in the TiCl 4/H2O ALD process, was found to be a result of a signiﬁcant chlorine amount adsorbed
during the TiCl4 pulse. Surface intermediates formed in the initial stage of TiCl4 adsorption were unstable and weakly bonded
to the surface. Desorption and decomposition of these species additionally inﬂuenced the deposition rate and, especially, its
dependence on the precursor pulse times. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V . All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Self-controlled thin ﬁlm deposition methods,
known as atomic layer epitaxy [1,2], molecular layer
epitaxy [3], molecular layering [4], atomic layer
deposition (ALD) [5–7], etc., allow reproducible
growth of thin and ultra-thin ﬁlms. A speciﬁc feature
of these methods is that a thin ﬁlm is formed as a result
of repeated deposition cycles. At least two subsequent
self-limited surface reactions are used to form a new
layer of the ﬁlm material in each cycle. In most
applications, the precursors reacting with the surface
are adsorbed from molecular beams [3] or from the
gas phase (e.g. [2,5–7]). The growth rate can reach one
monomolecular layer of the ﬁlm material per deposi-
tion cycle but usually it is signiﬁcantly lower, espe-
cially when compounds with large ligands are used as
the precursors. A common reason for reduced growth
rate is that a precursor molecule temporarily blocks
several adsorption sites while the constituent of the
ﬁlm material occupies only one or few of those.
Naturally, higher growth rates should be obtained
when using precursors with smaller ligands. However,
in some cases this general rule does not apply. For
instance, in the process where TiCl4 and H2Oo rH 2O2
are used as the precursors to grow titanium dioxide
(TiO2), typical growth rates have ranged from 0.04 to
0.07 nm per cycle at substrate temperatures of 150–
4008C [2,5–8]. Rather similar or even higher growth

rates can be obtained when using organic precursors
such as titanium ethoxide (Ti(OCH 2CH3)4) and
titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3)2)4) having
remarkably larger sizes of ligands. At temperatures
150–2508C, the growth rates of 0.05–0.15 nm per
cycle have been obtained in the ALD process where
titanium isopropoxide and H2Oo rH 2O2 were used as
the precursors [9,10]. In case of titanium ethoxide and
H2O, the growth rate reached 0.06–0.08 nm per cycle
[11].
The effective diameters of the TiCl 4, Ti(OCH
2CH3)4 and Ti(OCH(CH 3)2)4 molecules have been
estimated to be 0.64, 0.78 and 0.88 nm, respectively
[12]. Correspondingly, the theoretical limits of the
growth rate are 0.099, 0.067 and 0.052 nm per cycle
[12], provided that no exchange reactions take place
during adsorption of these titanium precursors. Of
course, exchange reactions that might appear during
adsorption of the precursors could reduce the size of
adsorbed species. In this way, larger amounts of
precursors can be adsorbed and higher growth rates
become possible.
When growing metal oxides in a process, in which
H2Oo rH 2O2 is used as an oxygen precursor, hydroxyl
groups can be formed on the surface during the
oxygen precursor pulse. Thus, the metal precursor
adsorbed may react with surface hydroxyl groups
and release some ligands in this reaction. It has been
shown that at 200–250 8C, in average 2.2–2.9 ligands
are released from each Ti(OCH(CH 3)2)4 molecule in
the Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4/H2O and Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4/H2O2
processes [10]. Signiﬁcant ligand release from
adsorbed Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 molecules explains why
the experimental values of growth rate are sometimes
remarkably higher than those estimated from the
Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 molecule size. In the Ti(OCH 2-
CH3)4/H2O process, by contrast, the average number
of ligands released from an adsorbing molecule does
not exceed 1.5 [11], and the growth rate is comparable
to the estimation given above [12].
Haukka et al. [13–16] have shown that the exchange
reactions with hydroxyl groups also contribute to
TiCl4/H2O process, at least when growing TiO 2 on
silica catalysts. These authors have concluded that
each TiCl4 molecule reacts with one to two hydroxyl
groups and as a result up to two chlorine ligands are
released from an adsorbed TiCl4 molecule. In this
context, however, it is not clear why the experimen-
tally obtained growth rates of the thin ﬁlms are up to
two times lower than the theoretical value calculated
for the process, in which no ligands are released from
adsorbed TiCl4. It has been discussed that HCl, which
is released in the reaction between TiCl 4 and surface
hydroxyl groups, may re-adsorb and occupy adsorp-
tion sites for TiCl4 [2,16,17]. Another possibility is
that the exchange reactions, which do contribute to the
growth on silica catalysts, are hindered in case of
planar substrates. This may be due to different struc-
ture of substrates and/or growing ﬁlm. Indeed, forma-
tion of surface hydroxyl groups on crystalline oxides
might depend, for instance, on the structure type and
crystalline plane, which is exposed to water vapor.
Therefore, it would not be surprising if the growth
mechanism was dependent on the structure develop-
ment as well. In order to lighten these problems, we
performed the study described below. The work was
aimed at better understanding the reaction mechan-
isms in the TiCl 4/H2O process and revealing the
reasons for rather limited growth rate on planar sub-
strates in ﬂow-type ALD reactors.
Unfortunately, the choice of methods for surface
studies in this kind of reactors is limited. For instance,
electron spectroscopy methods, such as Auger elec-
tron spectroscopy etc. cannot be applied because the
surface intermediate species formed in the growth
process are unlikely so stable that they would save
their characteristics during transportation of the sub-
strates from the growth reactor to an ultra-high
vacuum analysis chamber. At the same time, the
infrared spectroscopy method that has been used in
case of porous silica catalysts [14,16] is not sufﬁ-
ciently sensitive to record the surface species on
planar substrates. For this reason, the quartz crystal
microbalance (QCM) method [18] was applied to
investigate the deposition kinetics in real-time and
reveal the most probable reaction mechanisms. The
same technique was used to study the reactions of HCl
with hydroxylated TiO2 surface and the effect of
crystal structure development on the growth process.
2. Experimental
The thin ﬁlms were grown in a low pressure ﬂow-
type ALD reactor [18]. Each of the periodically
repeated growth cycles included a TiCl4 pulse, purge

time, H2O pulse and another purge time. The vapors of
TiCl4 and H2O were carried into the reaction zone in
the ﬂow of pure (99.999%) nitrogen gas. During the
purge times, only the carrier gas was led through the
reactor. The process was carried out at the pressure of
250 Pa.
QCM working at the oscillation frequency of
30 MHz was applied to record the deposition kinetics
in real-time. In the real-time measurements, the thin
ﬁlm was deposited on the mass sensor of QCM while
the mass changes were recorded with sampling period
of 0.5 s. To reduce the effect of the mass sensor on the
growth process, a buffer layer of TiO 2 was deposited
on the sensor crystal before starting the measure-
ments. Buffer layers grown at different temperatures,
TB, allowed us to vary the structure of the ﬁlm, on
which the deposition kinetics was studied. The sub-
strate temperatureTG, at which the QCM studies of the
growth process were performed, was varied from 100
to 4008C and stabilized with the accuracy of 0.18C. In
addition to the conventional ALD process, we inves-
tigated the effect of subsequent exposures of TiO2
ﬁlms to HCl and H2O. This enabled us to estimate the
possible contribution of re-adsorption of gaseous
reaction products to the thin ﬁlm growth.
Generally, the QCM method should enable one to
estimate the abundance of adsorbed surface species,
when a calibration procedure has been made and
absolute values of mass changes have been measured.
However, the mass sensors used in this work had very
rough surfaces and therefore the actual surface areas
of them were not known. Thus, only the relative mass
changes were measured in this work because in no
case, reliable determination of the mass exchange per
unit area would have been possible. The reproduci-
bility of our QCM measurements was mainly deter-
mined by the instability of the oscillation frequency.
AtTG 100–2008C, the frequency ﬂuctuations did
not exceed 2 Hz. This enabled us to record the mass
changes corresponding to a complete ALD cycle with
the uncertainty of about5%. The instability
increased with growth temperature and reached
4H za t TG 4008C. As a result the corresponding
experimental uncertainty of recording the mass incre-
ments mentioned above increased to 10%.
The ﬁlms for ex situ characterization were grown on
single crystal (1 0 0)-oriented silicon and amorphous
silica substrates. During the growth, the substrate
surface was parallel to the gas ﬂow direction. The
TiCl4 and H 2O ﬂow rates were set at 0.9 and
8 mPa m3/s, respectively, while the precursor pulse
times and purge times were equal to 2 s. The partial
pressure corresponding to the H2O ﬂow rate used was
about 6 Pa at the reactor outlet. Reﬂection high energy
electron diffraction (RHEED) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) methods were applied to characterize the
structure of the ﬁlms while the Auger electron spectro-
scopy (AES) method was used for composition stu-
dies. The refractive index and thickness of the ﬁlms
deposited on silica substrates were calculated from
optical transmission spectra [19].
3. Results
Fig. 1 shows the behavior of the mass sensor signal
recorded during a single ALD cycle at two different
mass sensor temperatures. During the TiCl4 pulse, the
mass, ﬁrst abruptly increased and then saturated. A
decrease of the mass sensor signal followed when the
TiCl4 pulse was switched off at higher substrate
temperatures (Fig. 1). This decrease demonstrated
that some kind of surface intermediate species formed
during TiCl4 pulse or some precursor ligands were
weakly bonded to the surface and could be easily

released. At TG 3008C, the mass sensor signal
decreased in the very beginning of the ﬁrst purge time
and then stayed at an almost constant level (Fig. 1).
Therefore, the intermediate species that remained on
the surface until beginning of the H 2O pulse were
stable and rather strongly bonded to the ﬁlm material.
During the following H2O pulse the mass sensor signal
rapidly decreased and stabilized on a new level.
Decrease of the ﬁlm mass caused by the H2O pulse
indicated that the surface intermediate species formed
in the TiCl4 adsorption process were heavier than the
ﬁnal reaction products. This was not surprising
because the former species might contain chlorine,
which was replaced by much lighter oxygen or hydro-
xyl groups during an exposure to H2O. After switching
off the H 2O pulse, no changes were observed at
TG 3008C. At 100 8C, by contrast, an additional
decrease appeared in the beginning of the second
purge time. The latter decrease was probably due to
dehydration of the ﬁlm surface.
The dependencies of the mass increments Dm0 and
Dm1 on the growth temperature and precursor pulse
times were studied on buffer layers deposited at two
different temperatures. In the ﬁrst series of measure-
ments a buffer layer was grown onto the mass sensor
by applying 60 cycles at the mass sensor temperature
of 1008C. According to the RHEED data, the ﬁlms
deposited under such conditions were always amor-
phous. Using this kind of buffer layer the dependen-
cies ofDm0 and Dm1 on the growth temperature (solid
and open circles in Fig. 2, respectively) were recorded
in the range of 100–3508C by applying 10 cycles at
each temperature. Altogether, 40 cycles were per-
formed at temperatures 150–3508C where crystalliza-
tion might take place. RHEED data showed that this
was still not sufﬁcient to initiate crystal growth on
amorphous substrates. It was revealed that in the
beginning of the growth process, amorphous material
was formed on silicon and silica substrates as well as
on a buffer layer of amorphous TiO2 grown at 1008C.
The number of cycles needed for initiation of crystal-
lization was about 100 cycles atTG 275–3508C but
it increased with decreasing growth temperature
(Table 1). For this reason, one can conclude that
the data obtained in the experiments, where only 40
cycles were applied to grow a ﬁlm on an amorphous
buffer layer, described the growth of amorphous
TiO2.
The second series of measurements was performed
using a sensor coated with the buffer layer by applying
100 cycles at 3008C. In this case, more complex
studies (Figs. 2–6) were carried out while the mea-
surements were started atTG 4008C and continued
at 350, 300, 250, 200, 150 and 100 8C. The total
thickness of the ﬁlm deposited on the mass sensor
in this series was about 20 nm.
One can see in Fig. 2 that both Dm0 and Dm1
depended on the temperature, at which the real-time
measurements were performed, as well as on the
temperature, at which the buffer layer had been grown.
The data depicted in Table 1 show that differently
from the ﬁlms deposited at 100 8C, those grown at
3008C and higher temperatures contained at least
some amount of crystalline phase when the number

layers were deposited at 100 and 3008C. The TiCl4 pulse time, ﬁrst
purge time, H 2O pulse time, and second purge time were 2, 2, 2,
and 5 s, respectively.

of cycles exceeded 100. Therefore, the structure of the
buffer layer was probably one factor that inﬂuenced
the growth rate. At temperatures 150–350 8C, for
instance, considerably higher growth rates were
obtained on the crystalline buffer layer (Fig. 2). How-
ever, within the experimental uncertainty, there was no
difference whether the deposition was performed onto
the amorphous or crystalline layer at TG 100–
1508C.
The precursor pulse times affected the growth at
temperatures close to 100 and 400 8C (Fig. 3). The
TiCl4 pulse length inﬂuenced Dm0, only, while the

pulse times. Buffer layer was grown at 300 8C. Cycle times shown

effect appeared at TG 4008C (Fig. 3(a)). By con-
trast, both Dm0 and Dm1 increased with the H2O pulse
length at the lowest growth temperature studied
(Fig. 3(b)). In addition, it was revealed that variation
of theTiCl4 and H2O ﬂuxes somewhat inﬂuenced the
value of Dm0. However, the effect was rather weak.
Increase of the TiCl4 and H2O ﬂow rates by the factor
of three caused 5–10% increase in Dm0 whereas
remarkable effect of higher water dose appeared at
TG 1008C, only.
The value of Dm1 ÿDm0, which equaled to Dm2
(Fig. 1), had a maximum in theTG range of 250–3008C
(Fig. 3) where the growth per cycle was lowest. At the
same time the mass decreaseDm0
2 that was observed
during the ﬁrst purge time (Fig. 1), monotonously
increased with the mass sensor temperature (Fig. 4).
As can be seen, the dependence ofDm0
2 on TB was
rather weak. It was also revealed that within experi-
mental uncertainty, Dm0
2 was independent of TiCl 4
(Fig. 4) and H 2O pulse times when they were varied
from 0.5 to 5 s and the ﬁrst purge time was kept at 2 s.
In order to study the deposition process in more
detail, the value of Dm0 as a function of purge times
was recorded at 150 and 350 8C (Fig. 5). At both
temperatures, a fast decrease in Dm0 took place with
the increase of both purge times from 0.1 to 1 s. This
effect was mainly related to the overlap of precursor
pulses. Longer purge times used after TiCl4 pulse did
not inﬂuence the growth rate at 150 8C (Fig. 5(a)). At
3508C, however, Dm0 decreased in the purge time
range of 1–10 s, as well, indicating that the amount of
titanium bonded to the surface decreased with increas-
ing purge time. Such behavior ofDm0 correlated with
the decrease of the mass sensor signal by Dm0
2, which
occurred at higher temperatures during the ﬁrst purge
time (Fig. 1). Consequently, the latter mass decrease
was related to desorption of titanium-containing sur-
face intermediate species. The 1–10 s long purge
times used after H2O pulse, contrary, did not affect
Dm0 rate at 350 8C but inﬂuenced it at 150 8C
(Fig. 5(b)). The decrease of Dm0, which appeared
with increasing second purge time at 150 8C, was
probably connected with dehydration of the ﬁlm sur-
face. An evidence of such process was the mass
decrease that was observed after switching off the
H2O pulse at low temperatures (Fig. 1).
According to the data depicted in Fig. 3(a) the value
of Dm0 noticeably depended on the TiCl4 pulse time at
TG 4008C. At pulse times reaching 10 s, however, a
similar dependence was observed at 350 8C, as well
(Fig. 6). Differently from Dm0, the value of Dm1 as a
function of TiCl4 pulse time almost completely satu-
rated at the latter temperature (Fig. 6). At the same
time,Dm0
2 decreased with the increase of TiCl4 expo-
sure time from 2 to 10 s. As a result, no saturation of
Dm1 ÿDm0
2 was obtained. This means that although
Dm1 saturated, the amount of strongly bonded surface
intermediate species did not. Decrease of Dm0
2 with
increasing TiCl4 pulse time, in turn, indicated that the
amount of weakly bonded surface intermediate spe-
cies decreased during relatively long exposure times.
Subsequent exposures of the mass sensor to HCl
and H 2O performed at substrate temperatures 150–
3508C revealed some mass increase during the HCl
pulse. The amplitude of that change depended on the
substrate temperature and was around 30% of theDm2
value recorded in case of conventional TiCl 4/H2O
sequence at the same temperature. Evidently, the
exposure to HCl did not form stable surface inter-
mediate species because a few seconds after switching
off the HCl pulse, the initial level of the mass sensor
signal was recovered independently of whether the
H2O pulse was applied or not. The fact that the HCl
pulse formed no strongly bonded surface intermedi-
ates allowed us to suppose that re-adsorption of HCl
could unlikely have a strong effect on the TiCl4
adsorption. This conclusion was indirectly supported
by the fact that the ﬁlms grown on silicon and silica
Fig. 6. Dm0, Dm1 and Dm1 ÿDm0
2 recorded at 3508C as functions
of TiCl 4 pulse time. The ﬁrst purge time, H 2O pulse time, and
second purge time were 10, 2 and 5 s, respectively.

substrates were of very uniform thickness indepen-
dently of the growth temperature used. The thickness
gradients, if existed at all, did not exceed few percent
on the 60 mm2 30 mm2 substrate area.
No chlorine signal was recorded by AES in the ﬁlms
grown at 275 8C whereas the sensitivity of the mea-
surements was estimated to be about 0.04 at.%. Chlor-
ine was detected in the ﬁlms grown at 200, 150 and
1008C but its concentration did not exceed 0.1, 0.2 and
0.5 at.%, respectively. The O/Ti ratio of the ﬁlms
grown at substrate temperatures of 150–2758C corre-
sponded to stoichiometric TiO2 within the experimen-
tal uncertainty of our AES measurements. In the ﬁlms
grown at temperatures of 100–1258C, some oxygen
deﬁciency reaching up to 5–10% was still recorded.
XRD and RHEED measurements revealed that
crystalline ﬁlms with anatase structure were obtained
on silicon and silica substrates at the growth tempera-
tures of 150–3508C. In addition to anatase, a minor
amount of rutile was recorded in the ﬁlms grown at
4258C. As mentioned above, crystallization did not
start from the beginning of the deposition process
(Table 1). Similarly to earlier studies [5,20], prefer-
ential orientation of crystallites was observed in crys-
talline ﬁlms of sufﬁcient thickness. The preferential
orientation was strongest in the ﬁlms grown at sub-
strate temperatures of 275–3508C. An interesting
result was that the crystallinity of the ﬁlms, in parti-
cular those grown at 1508C (Fig. 7), was lower at the
leading edges of substrates, which were closer to the
inlet of the precursors.
The growth rates determined from optical measure-
ments of the ﬁlms grown on silica substrates by
applying 3000 ALD cycles at 100, 150, 275 and
4258C were 0.078, 0.048, 0.072 and 0.050 nm per
cycle, respectively. Comparing these values with the
data presented in Figs. 2 and 3, one can ﬁnd that the
growth rate calculated from the thickness of relatively
thick ﬁlms behaved with changing substrate tempera-
ture in a rather different way thanDm0 did. Partially
the relatively high growth rate of thicker ﬁlms at
2758C can be explained by lower density of those
compared with the ﬁlms grown at 150 and 425 8C.
Indeed, the values of the refractive index of the ﬁlms
grown at 100, 150, 275 and 425 8C equaled to 2.37,
2.63, 2.37 and 2.55, respectively. Thus, the ﬁlms
grown at 2758C were really of lower density than
those grown at 150 and 425 8C. However, the differ-
ence in the refractive index was about 10%, only. At
the same time the growth rate was about 1.5 times
higher at 2758C than at 150 and 425 8C. For this
reason, one should consider the possibility that crys-
tallization, which affected the growth rate of very thin
ﬁlms, already (Fig. 2), even stronger inﬂuenced the
deposition of thicker ﬁlms, in which the crystal struc-
ture and preferential orientation were more developed.
4. Discussion
The data presented in the previous section indicate
that at the growth temperatures of 100–350 8C and
TiCl4 doses used, adsorption of TiCl4 saturates during
few seconds, already. The data also show that the mass
of surface intermediate species formed is higher than
that of the solid reaction product obtained after H 2O
pulse. Most of the surface intermediate species formed
during TiCl4 adsorption are stable and strongly
bonded to the surface. However, decrease of the ﬁlm
mass during the ﬁrst purge time (Fig. 1) and depen-
dence ofDm0 on that purge length (Fig. 5(a)) still
indicates desorption of some intermediate species
from the surface. The species that stay on the surface
react with H2O in the next reaction step. As revealed
by the post-growth studies, the result of such two-step
reaction is stoichiometric TiO2 provided that

chlorine ligands, H 2O is obviously able to create
surface hydroxyl groups on the as-grown TiO 2 ﬁlm.
The decrease of the mass sensor signal observed at
TG 1008C after the H 2O pulse (Fig. 1), in turn,
indicates that during the second purge, dehydration of
the surface takes place. The abundance of surface
hydroxyl groups remaining on the surface evidently
depends on the temperature as well as on the purge
length used. Indeed, it has been shown that the stable
concentration of hydroxyl groups residing on the
surface of TiO2 decreases with increasing tempera-
ture. However, some abundance of them has been
recorded at temperatures exceeding 4008C [21]. When
TiCl4 adsorbs on such surface, exchange reactions are
possible. For instance, in the exchange reaction with
two hydroxyl groups [13,14], two chlorine ligands can
be released from adsorbing TiCl4

The equations describing the surface reactions
allow one to calculate the relative mass changes
corresponding to different reaction steps. In case of
the TiCl4 adsorption reaction (Eq. (1)), the mass
increase equals to Mi ÿMh, where Mi is the mass
of surface intermediate species (TiCl 2) and Mh the
mass of hydrogen replaced by one species. A complete
ALD cycle causes the mass increaseMo, which equals
to the molar mass of ﬁlm material (TiO 2). Evidently,
the Mo=Mi ÿMh ratio does not depend on the
abundance of surface intermediate species provided
that there is no desorption of titanium-containing
species during the reaction with water vapor.
QCM measurements show that rather stable surface
intermediate layer is obtained on the ﬁlm surface after
the 2 s long ﬁrst purge time (Fig. 1). Therefore,
comparing theMo=Mi ÿMhratio with the values
of Dm0=Dm1 ÿDm0
2obtained at different growth
temperatures, one can reveal the most probable reac-
tion mechanisms. For instance, theMo=Mi ÿMh
ratio calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2) is equal to
0.68. It can be seen, however, that this value ﬁts to
the experimental Dm0=Dm1 ÿDm0
2ratios (Fig. 8) at
TG 4008C, only.

Correspondingly, the Mo=Mi ÿMhratio is equal

ever, the Dm0=Dm1 ÿDm0

cantly lower (Fig. 8). This fact allows one to suppose
that in the latter temperature range, the TiCl4 adsorp-
tion could proceed without any release of gaseous
reaction products. Such process may be described as
dissociation of TiCl 4 on the dehydroxylated surface
followed by adsorption of TiCl 3 and Cl [2]. Corre-

ratios obtained at substrate temperatures of 200–
3508C. However, existing experimental data [21]
indicate that the TiO 2 surface is unlikely hydroxyl-
free at these temperatures. Therefore, one should
consider the possibility that reacting with hydroxyl
groups, TiCl4 could form surface Ti(OH) xCl4ÿx spe-
cies with 1 x 3. This reaction may also proceed
without formation gaseous reaction products and
result inMo=Mi ÿMh 0:42
Ti(OH)xCl4ÿx has been considered to be a volatile
surface species that can migrate on the ﬁlm surface
and be responsible for agglomeration [16,22] in the
ALD process. The results obtained in this work also
indicate that some kind of intermediate species may
really contribute to the crystal growth. Indeed, the
ﬁlms were more crystalline at the trailing edge of
substrates. Thus, drift of some intermediate species in
the gas ﬂow direction and re-adsorption of them might
be considered as an effect that accelerates crystal-
lization.
Under certain conditions Ti(OH) xCl4ÿx obviously
releases HCl and forms TiO 2 or TiOCl2 on the solid
surface [2,15,16]. Consequently, both desorption of
volatile Ti(OH)xCl4ÿx and decomposition of that
cause a decrease in the ﬁlm mass without H2O supply
and could well explain the mass decrease observed
during the ﬁrst purge time. Furthermore, if the decom-
position of surface Ti(OH) xCl4ÿx took place during
the TiCl 4 pulse, already, a smaller mass decrease
would appear during the following purge time.
Simultaneously, additional adsorption sites should
be created for TiCl4 adsorption and an increase of
Dm0 should be observed with increasing TiCl 4 pulse
time. This kind of effect (Fig. 6) was recorded in our
QCM measurements. When increasing the TiCl4
pulse time and the following purge time up to
1 0 s ,an o t i c e a b l ed e c r e a s ei nDm0
2 was obtained.
Moreover, the Dm0=Dm1 ÿDm0
2ratio as high as
0.62 was observed at TG 3508C. This is consider-
ably higher than the value of 0.44–0.47 recorded at
TiCl4 pulse time of 0.5–5 s and purge time of 2 s at
the same temperature (Fig. 8). The average Cl/Ti
ratio in the surface intermediate species that was
estimated from the Dm0=Dm1 ÿDm0
2 ratio was
about 2.5 after the 10 s long TiCl 4 pulse and 10 s
long purge time. This value is rather close to those
reported for the TiCl4/H2O process performed on
silica catalyst [16].
It is worth noting, however, that although the model,
which assumes formation of Ti(OH)xCl4ÿx during the
TiCl4 pulse, very well explains all experimental
results, the QCM data alone do not allow one to
exclude the possible role of TiCl 4 adsorption on
dehydroxylated sites. Indeed, if the surface oxychlor-
ides that could be formed in the latter process were
sufﬁciently volatile and able to decompose, all effects
described above would be also observed. Neverthe-
less, the QCM studies unambiguously conﬁrm that at
temperatures of 200–3508C, close to four chlorine
atoms are adsorbed together with each titanium atom.
At temperatures below 200 and above 350 8C, the
amount of adsorbed chloride decreases. Simulta-
neously, as can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, the growth
rate increases at these temperatures. The reason for
reduced chlorine concentration in the surface inter-
mediate species formed atTG <2008C is evidently
increasing abundance of hydroxyl groups or even
molecular water on the surface where TiCl 4 is
adsorbed. At temperatures above 350 8C, however,
smaller Cl/Ti ratio in the adsorbate layer is con-
nected with faster decomposition of the surface
intermediate species. One could further speculate
that the reactions with surface hydroxyl groups
and/or decomposition of surface intermediate spe-
cies reduce the mobility of the latter. Such conclu-
sion is strongly supported by the fact that the texture
was preferentially formed at temperatures 275–
3508C where no chlorine was released during TiCl 4
adsorption. At the same time, the texture develop-
ment was hindered at TG <200 and TG >3508C
where the Cl/Ti ratio was lower than four in the
surface intermediate layer.
The idea about formation of slowly decomposing
surface species explains why the data characterizing
the thin ﬁlm growth on planar substrates differ from
those describing the process on silica catalysts [13–
16]. In the latter case TiCl4 pulse times as long as 2 h
were used. This time allows the unstable surface
intermediate species to decompose and form oxy-
chlorides as predicted by Eqs. (1) and (3) (see also
[15,16]). In the thin ﬁlm growth processes, by con-
trast, the TiCl 4 pulse times have been usually few
seconds [5,8] or even shorter [2,6,7]. Our results show
that this is insufﬁcient to completely stabilize the
surface intermediate layer formed in the TiCl4 adsorp-
tion step.

As discussed above, the reaction between surface
hydroxyl groups and HCl released in reactions
described by Eqs. (1) and (3), can additionally con-
tribute to chlorine trapping at the ﬁlm surface. The
experimental results obtained show, however, that this
is not the main effect responsible for relatively low
growth rate. First, the HCl pulse created much lower
surface coverage of chlorine than the reactions with
TiCl4 did. Secondly, the surface coverage formed
during the HCl pulse was not stable. Finally, very
uniform thickness of the ﬁlms conﬁrmed that the
inﬂuence of HCl re-adsorption could not be remark-
able.
Results presented in Fig. 8 indicate that within our
experimental uncertainty, the deposition temperature
and the structure of the buffer layer had no effect on
theDm0=Dm1 ÿDm0
2ratio. Similarly, the thin ﬁlm
structure had no measurable inﬂuence on desorption
of surface intermediate species (Fig. 4). At the same
time, the amounts of TiCl4 adsorbed on the TiO2 layers
of dissimilar origin differed considerably (Fig. 2). These
facts demonstrate that the effect of surface microstruc-
ture on the TiO2 growth is more signiﬁcantly related to
the number of adsorption sites than to the changes in
adsorption and/or desorption mechanisms. A probable
reason for the increased number of adsorption sites on
thesurfaceof(crystalline)ﬁlmsgrownatTG 3008Ci s
agglomeration [5,7,22] and corresponding increase in
effective surface area. Signiﬁcant surface roughening
that has been observed atTG 1508C with develop-
ment of the crystal structure [5,7] strongly supports this
conclusion.
5. Conclusions
We have revealed in this work that signiﬁcant
amount of chlorine that is bonded to the surface during
TiCl4 adsorption, is the main reason for rather limited
growth rate in the TiCl 4/H2O ALD process. Some
chlorine is released in the TiCl 4 adsorption step at
temperatures below 2008C and above 3508C. At inter-
mediate temperatures, however, most of chlorine that
contains in TiCl4 is adsorbed in the initial stage of
interaction between TiCl4 and TiO2 surface exposed to
H2O. With the increase of the TiCl4 pulse time and the
following purge time, especially at higher growth
temperatures, the Cl/Ti ratio in the surface intermedi-
ate species decreases, indicating that a decomposition
process proceeds on the ﬁlm surface after adsorption
of precursor molecules. Simultaneously, some tita-
nium-containing surface intermediate species are
released from the ﬁlm surface during the purge time.
Surface migration of these weakly bonded surface
intermediate species evidently contributes to the crys-
tallization process because the ﬁlms are more crystal-
line at the trailing edge of substrates. The
crystallization process, in turn, inﬂuences the growth
rate. The QCM data indicate that the growth rate
increase observed with the initiation of crystal growth
is due to more effective adsorption of TiCl 4 on the
crystalline ﬁlm than on the amorphous TiO 2.
