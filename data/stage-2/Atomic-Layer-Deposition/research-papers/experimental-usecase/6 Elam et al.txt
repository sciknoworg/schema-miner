Abstract
Surface chemistry and film growth were examined during titanium nitride (TiN ) atomic layer deposition (ALD ) using sequential
exposures of tetrakis-dimethylamino titanium (TDMAT ) and NH . This ALD system is shown to be far from ideal and illustrates3
many potential problems that may affect ALD processing. These studies were performed using in situ Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR ) techniques and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM ) measurements. Ex situ measurements also analyzed the properties of
the TiN ALD films. The FTIR studies revealed that TDMAT reacts with NH * species on the TiN surface following NH x 3
exposures to deposit new Ti (N (CH )) * species. Subsequent NH exposure consumes the dimethylamino species and regenerates32 x 3
the NH * species. These observations are consistent with transamination exchange reactions during the TDMAT and NHx 3
exposures. QCM studies determined that the TDMAT and NH reactions are nearly self-limiting. However, slow continual growth 3
occurs with long TDMAT exposures. In addition, the TiN ALD growth rate increases progressively with growth temperature. The
resistivities of the TiN ALD films were 010 mV cm and the densities were (3g ycm corresponding to a porosity of ;40%.43
The high porosity allows facile oxidation of the TiN films and lowers the film resistivities. These high film porosities will
seriously impair the use of these TiN ALD films as diffusion barriers.

1. Introduction
Thin film diffusion barriers are required in semi-
conductor devices to prevent the migration of metal
atoms from the interconnects into the adjacent dielectric
and semiconductor regionsw1 x. Titanium nitride (TiN )
is one of the most widely used diffusion barrier materials
w1 x. TiN is a hard, refractory material and has a bulk
resistivity of 22 mV cm. The shrinking of device dimen-
sions demands thinner diffusion barrier films deposited
in higher aspect ratio contact holes and vias. Atomic
layer deposition(ALD ) can be an ideal technique for
growing conformal films on high aspect ratio structures.
ALD utilizes two sequential self-limiting reactions that
occur between a gaseous precursor and the solid sub-
strate. By repeating these surface reactions in an

ABAB « binary sequence, a thin film can be deposited
with atomic layer thickness control w2,3 x.
A wide variety of materials can be deposited by ALD
w4 x. Established TiN ALD techniques rely on titanium
chloride precursors and are based on the binary chemical
vapor deposition(CVD ) reaction w5–7 x:
3TiCl q4NH ™3TiN q12HCl q1 y2N (1 )43 2
Unfortunately , titanium chloride precursors are not
optimal for the fabrication of diffusion barriers. The
high temperatures of 4008C required for TiN ALD
growth using titanium chlorides are incompatible with
semiconductor backend processing. The HCl reaction
product can also combine with the NH precursor to3
form a nonvolatile NH Cl salt and generate particulate4
contamination. Incomplete reaction of the TiCl precur- 4
sor produces chloride contamination of the TiN film and
increases the film resistivity . Furthermore, the corrosive

146 J.W. Elam et al. / Thin Solid Films 436 (2003) 145–156
HCl reaction products can etch the metal interconnects.
An alternative TiN ALD surface chemistry utilizing
TiIw8 x suffers from similar limitations.4
Recently , alternative TiN ALD schemes have been
developed employing the non-halogenated precursors
tetrakis-ethylmethylamino titanium(TEMAT ) w9,10 x
and tetrakis-dimethylamino titanium (TDMAT ) w11 x.

Because of their relevance to TiN CVD, the gas phase
and surface reactions of TDMAT and NH have received 3
much attention w12–19 x. The reaction given by Eq. (2 )
is believed to occur by a combination of transamination
exchange and amine elimination reactionsw15 x.

where the asterisks designate the surface species. Eqs.
(3 ) and (4 ) are both transamination exchange reactions
in which the NH * surface species are replaced byx
Ti (N (CH )) * surface species and vice versa. Note that32 y
the Ti changes its oxidation number from 4 to 3 in Eq.
(4 ). This change is necessary to achieve the correct Ti
oxidation number in bulk TiN.
Previous TiN ALD investigations using TEMAT and
NH have concentrated on optimizing the growth con-3
ditions to improve the physical properties of the resulting
TiN filmsw9,10 x. These TiN ALD studies were presented
under the assumption that this system displays ideal
ALD behavior. Few studies have been reported for TiN
ALD using TDMATw11 x. The present study explores
the surface chemistry and film growth of TiN using
sequential exposures to TDMAT and NH . Fourier3
transform infrared (FTIR ) absorption measurements
were performed in situ under high vacuum conditions
to verify the exchange of surface functional groups. In
situ quartz crystal microbalance(QCM ) measurements
were conducted in a viscous flow ALD reactor to
determine the mass changes during the individual
TDMAT and NH sequential exposures. A variety of ex3
situ techniques were also utilized to determine the
properties of the TiN ALD films. These studies illustrate
that TiN ALD using TDMAT and NH does not display3
ideal ALD behavior.
2. Experimental
2.1. FTIR studies
In situ FTIR transmission measurements were per-
formed in a vacuum apparatus equipped with a Nicolet
Magna 560 spectrometer and an MCT -Bdetector w20–
22 x. The stainless steel chamber was maintained at high
vacuum using a turbomolecular pump. The infrared
beam entered the vacuum chamber through a CsI win-
dow, passed through the sample substrate and exited
through a second CsI window . During reactant expo-
sures, the turbomolecular pump and CsI windows were
isolated from the chamber by closing gate valves. A
Baratron capacitance manometer and leak valves were
used for controlling the reactant exposures. In between
exposures, the chamber was evacuated to a pressure
-5 =10 T orr to remove the ALD reaction productsy7
and unreacted precursors.
The sample substrate for the FTIR studies consisted
of ZrO powder pressed into a tungsten support grid2
w21–23 x. Tantalum metal foils spot-welded to each side
of the tungsten grid allowed the sample to be suspended
by copper clamps and resistively heated. The sample
temperature was monitored using a chromel–alumel
thermocouple attached to the bottom edge of the tung-
sten grid using ceramic adhesive. Pressures of;0.1
T orr were used for the exposures of TDMAT (Schu-
macher electronic grade, )99.999% ). Pressures of 10
T orr were used during the exposures of NH (Aldrich3
anhydrous, )99.99% ).
2.2. QCM studies
The in situ QCM studies were performed in a home-
built viscous flow ALD reactor w24 x. The QCM was
housed in a 3.5-cm diameter stainless steel flow tube
that could be resistively heated between 60 and 240 8C.
An ultrahigh purity nitrogen carrier flow of 200 sccm
supplied by a pair of mass flow controllers continuously
passed through the flow tube and into a mechanical
pump. The nitrogen gas was further purified by an
Aeronex gate keeper inert gas purifier. The purifier
reduces the contamination level of O , CO, CO , H22 2
and H O in the nitrogen gas to less than 1 ppb. The2
nitrogen carrier gas transported the precursor vapors to
the QCM and swept away the unreacted precursors and
reaction products. A steady-state pressure of;1 T orr
and a carrier gas velocity of ;2.5 m ys were maintained
in the flow tube by adjusting a throttle valve located
above the mechanical pump.
TDMAT and NH pulses were injected into the3
nitrogen carrier gas using computer controlled solenoid
valves. The TDMAT was held in a stainless steel bubbler
maintained at 368C to provide a TDMAT vapor pressure
of ;0.25 T orr. During the TDMAT exposures, an

tra have been displaced for clarity in presentation.
ultrahigh purity nitrogen flow of 100 sccm provided by
a separate mass flow controller passed through the
TDMAT bubbler and into the flow reactor. Using the
conductances of the TDMAT delivery tubes, the nitrogen
mass flow rate through the TDMAT bubbler and the
total mass flow rate through the reactor, the TDMAT
pressure at the QCM is estimated to be;0.025 T orr.
At the end of each TDMAT exposure, the nitrogen flow
through the TDMAT bubbler was diverted into a sepa-
rate mechanical pump. During the NH exposures, the3
NH pressure in the flow tube was adjusted to be ;0.653
T orr using the NH pressure regulator and a needle3
valve located downstream of the NH solenoid valve. 3
The viscous flow ALD reactor was equipped with a
QCM enabling in situ film growth measurements. Pol-
ished QCM sensors from Colorado Crystal Corporation
(Part /H22107CCAT1BK-1007-000 ) were mounted in a Max-
tek BSH-150 bakeable sensor head attached to a 2.75-
inch conflat flange. The sensor head was modified to
provide a nitrogen flow of;20 sccm over the back
surface of the sensor crystal to prevent backside depo-
sitionw24 x. A Maxtek TM400 film thickness monitor
interfaced to a computer measured the QCM sensor
signals. The thickness monitor allowed mass measure-
ments with a resolution of 0.375 ngycm at 10 Hz.2
Assuming a TiN density of 5.22 g ycm , this mass3
resolution equates to a thickness resolution of 0.007 A ˚
for TiN. A thermocouple attached to the back of the
BSH-150 sensor head monitored the QCM temperature.
2.3. Film property studies
TiN ALD films were deposited in the viscous flow
ALD reactor onto Si (100 ) and soda-lime glass sub-
strates. Prior to depositing the TiN ALD films, the
substrates were degreased in a H SOyH O solution242 2
for 15 min, rinsed with deionized water and dried with
nitrogen gas. The properties of the TiN ALD films were
evaluated as a function of the deposition temperature
and the ALD cycle timing. These ex situ investigations
employed surface profilometry , four-point probe, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS ), X-ray diffraction
(XRD ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM )
measurements.
The resistivity of the TiN films deposited on glass
substrates was measured using a four-point probe. Film
thicknesses were determined by measuring step heights
on the Si(100 ) substrates using a Dektak-3 surface
profilometer. The chemical composition of the deposited
TiN films was analyzed at the Department of Materials
Chemistry in the Angstrom Laboratory at Uppsala Uni-˚
versity . These measurements employed a Perkin Elmer
PHI5500 XPS equipped with a hemispherical energy
analyzer and a monochromatic X-ray source (Al K a,
1486.6 eV ). The binding energy scale was calibrated by
setting the C 1s peak of carbon at 284.8 eV . The films
were sputtered with Ar ions for 10 s prior to analysisq
to remove surface contamination.
The phase composition of the TiN ALD films was
evaluated by grazing incidence XRD using a Simens
D5000 Diffractometer. These XRD measurements were
also performed in the Angstrom Laboratory at Uppsala˚
University . A Thermomicroscopes Autoprobe CP AFM
was used in intermittent contact mode to measure the
surface morphology and surface roughness of the TiN
ALD films.
3. Results
3.1. FTIR measurements
Transmission FTIR spectroscopy measurements were
used to explore the surface chemistry occurring during
sequential TDMAT and NH exposures. The ZrO sur-32
face was first exposed to two TiN ALD ABcycles using
saturation TDMAT exposures at 1528C and saturation
NH exposures at 77–227 8C. This procedure partially3
converts the ZrO surface to a TiN surface. FTIR2
measurements monitored this treatment and the conver-
sion of the initial hydroxylated ZrO surface to a TiN 2
surface terminated with NH * species. x
The TiN surface following NH exposures was then 3
exposed to increasing amounts of TDMAT at 152 8C.
Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra vs. TDMAT exposure
during the third TDMAT exposure in the ABAB «
sequence. This TDMAT exposure produces a loss of
absorbance in the 3100–3400 cm frequency regiony1

corresponding with N–H stretching vibrations from
NH * surface species. A concurrent increase in absorb-x
ance is observed in the 2700–3000 cm frequency y1
region corresponding with a gain in C–H stretching
vibrations from the dimethylamino species. The spectra
in Fig. 1 have been offset for clarity in presentation. A
TDMAT exposure of 3 T orr min is sufficient for the
TDMAT reaction to proceed nearly to completion at
1528C. Additional TDMAT exposure produces minimal
changes in the N–H and C–H stretching regions of the
FTIR spectra. In addition to the exchange between the
NH * and Ti(N (CH )) * surface species shown in Fig.x 32 x
1, large TDMAT exposures also produce a continual
increase in the background absorbance of the FTIR
spectra.
NH was then exposed to the TiN surface following3
the TDMAT exposures. This surface is terminated with
Ti (N (CH )) * species. The NH exposure removes the32 x 3
dimethylamino surface species. Fig. 2 displays the loss
of C–H stretching vibrations and gain of N–H stretching
vibrations vs. NH exposure at 1528C during the fourth3
NH exposure in the ABAB « sequence. The spectra3
are again offset for clarity . NH exposures of 600 3
T orr min displace most of the Ti (N (CH )) * surface32 x
species and replace them with NH * surface species. x
Fig. 2 reveals that additional NH exposure produces 3
very little change in the FTIR spectra. The FTIR
spectrum after an NH exposure of 3600 T orr min 3
reveals that a residual amount of dimethylamino surface
species are not easily reacted by long NH exposures.3
A comparison of the initial FTIR spectrum in Fig. 1
after the second NH exposure and the FTIR spectrum3
in Fig. 2 after the fourth saturation NH exposure reveals 3
that the absorbance for the C–H stretching vibration has
increased nearly a factor of two. This increase may be
caused by the buildup of dimethylamino species in the
growing TiN film.
The switching behavior vs. TDMAT and NH expo- 3
sures shown in Figs. 1 and 2 continues as the TiN film
is progressively deposited during TiN ALD. Fig. 3a
shows the integrated absorbances for the C–H and N–H
stretching vibrations vs. TDMAT exposure at 0.1 T orr
and 1528C during the third TDMAT exposure. Fig. 3b
displays the integrated absorbances for the C–H and
N–H stretching vibrations vs. NH exposure at 10 T orr3
and 152 8C during the fourth NH exposure. The data 3
points in Fig. 3 have been normalized to their maximum
values. The correlation between the loss and gain of the
absorbances of the C–H and N–H stretching vibrations

is consistent with the surface chemistry described by
Eqs. (3 ) and (4 ). Notice that the integrated infrared
absorbance for the C–H stretching vibrations after the
fourth NH exposure in Fig. 3b has increased relative3
to the integrated infrared absorbance for the C–H stretch-
ing vibration prior to the third TDMAT exposure shown
in Fig. 3a.
3.2. QCM measurements
The QCM displayed extremely linear TiN ALD
growth during the sequential TDMAT and NH expo- 3
sures. The nomenclature for the ALD pulse sequence is
t1– t2– t3– t4 where t1 is the TDMAT exposure time, t2
is the purge time following the TDMAT exposure, t3i s
the NH exposure time and t4 is the purge time following3
the NH exposure. Results for TiN growth during a3
pulse sequence of (100–10–20–30 ) at a deposition
temperature of 120 8C are shown in Fig. 4. The stepwise
structure of the mass changes correspond with the
TDMAT and NH exposures.3
Fig. 5a presents the results of QCM measurements
examining the influence of the TDMAT exposure time
on the TiN mass deposition rate. These experiments
were performed at a deposition temperature of 120 8C
and a TDMAT pressure of ;0.025 T orr using the pulse
sequence (x–10–6–10 ). The mass deposition rates were
obtained by averaging the mass increases produced by
3–6 separate ALD cycles. Fig. 5a shows that the mass
deposition rate initially increases rapidly with increasing
TDMAT exposure time at a pressure of ;0.025 T orr.
The mass deposition rate is 29.7 ng ycm ycycle for a 12
s TDMAT exposure and increases to 51.4 ng ycm ycycle2
for a 50 s TDMAT exposure.
For TDMAT exposure times 50 s, the mass depo- R
sition is not self-limiting. In this regime, the TiN
deposition displays a continual slow growth of ;0.05
ng ycm ys. The right axis shows the growth rates that2
result from assuming a bulk TiN density . Bulk TiN has
a Ti atom density of ds5.08 =10 ycm and a mass22 3
density of 5.22 g ycm . One monolayer (ML ) of TiN3
has an estimated thickness of d s2.70 =10 cmy1 y3 y8
and would yield a mass deposition rate of 141 ng ycm y2
cycle.

Fig. 6. Arrhenius plot of TiN ALD mass deposition rates for long,
medium and short reactant pulse sequences at deposition temperatures
of 60–2408C.
The effect of varying the NH exposure time on the 3
TiN mass deposition rate is shown in Fig. 5b. The QCM
measurements were performed at 120 8C using the ALD
pulse sequence (20–10– x–10 ). The mass deposition
rate increases very rapidly to 35.5 ng ycm ycycle for 0.22
s NH exposures. The TiN ALD growth rate subsequent-3
ly is self-limiting at 63.1 ng ycm ycycle for NH expo-2
3
sures 020 s.
Additional QCM experiments examined the effects of
independently varying the TDMAT and NH purge 3
times. For pulse sequences of (20– x–6–10 ), the mass
deposition rate decreases only slightly with increasing
TDMAT purge times from 57.6 ngycm ycycle at 0.1 s2
to an average value of 55.8 ng ycm ycycle for purge2
times above ;5 s. In contrast, the mass deposition rate
decreases much more noticeably with increasing NH 3
purge times. For pulse sequences of (20–10–6– x), the
TiN ALD growth rate decreases from 69.8 ng ycm y2
cycle at 2 s to 46.8 ng ycm ycycle for purge times of2
030 s.
The QCM measurements do not clearly indicate an
optimal timing sequence for TiN ALD. Fig. 5a and b
exhibit a rapid initial increase in mass deposition fol-
lowed by regions of slower change. In particular, Fig.
5a does not show self-limiting behavior vs. TDMAT
exposure. T o explore further the effects of the reactant
exposure times, three ALD pulse sequences were select-
ed to investigate the TiN ALD surface chemistry and
film growth. The designations and timings for these
pulse sequences are: ‘short’(1–0.5–1–5 ), ‘medium’
(20–10–6–10 ) and ‘long’ (100–10–20–30 ). The expo-
sure times for the short, medium and long pulse sequenc-
es are indicated by the solid, dotted and dashed lines,
respectively , in Fig. 5a and b.
TiN ALD was performed using the short, medium
and long timing sequences at deposition temperatures of
60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 2408C. At each
temperature and timing sequence, TiN ALD was per-
formed until the QCM indicated that the TiN film was
growing at a constant rate. At this point, the QCM data
was recorded for at least 10 ALD cycles. For example,
the solid line in Fig. 4 shows the QCM data measured
at 1208C using the long pulse sequence. The dotted
line in this figure is a linear least squares fit to the
QCM data and yields a mass deposition rate of 71.0
ngycm ycycle.2
Fig. 6 shows an Arrhenius plot of the mass deposition
rates obtained from the QCM measurements. The cor-
responding TiN growth rates are also given assuming a
TiN bulk density of 5.22 gycm . For each pulse3
sequence, the mass deposition rate increases nearly
exponentially with deposition temperature. In addition,
at a given temperature, the mass deposition rate increases
monotonically between the short, medium and long
pulse sequences. For the short pulses, the mass deposi-
tion rate exhibits an activation energy of 0.12("0.01 )
eV . The medium and long pulse sequences show acti-
vation energies of 0.13 ("0.01 ) and 0.12 ("0.01 ) eV ,
respectively , between 60 and 150 8C. Between 180 and
240 8C, the activation energies obtained using the
medium and long pulses are 0.35 ("0.07 ) and
0.57 ("0.09 ) eV , respectively .
The QCM measurements also revealed changes in the
individual QCM pulse shapes with variations in depo-
sition temperature and pulse timing. For example, Fig.
7 presents the average QCM pulse shape obtained from
10 ALD cycles using the long exposures at 120 8C. The
ALD timing sequence is indicated above the QCM data.
During the TDMAT exposure, there is a rapid increase
in apparent mass followed by a long period of much
slower apparent mass gain. The term ‘apparent’ is
employed because the QCM is sensitive to both mass
and temperature changesw25 x. T emperature changes may
be initiated by perturbations to the gas flow by intro-
ducing reactants and subsequently removing the reac-
tants. During the TDMAT purge, some apparent mass is
lost. The NH exposure causes a large apparent mass3
gain of ;80 ng ycm . However, all of this apparent2
mass is lost during the subsequent NH purge. In fact, 3
there is a net apparent mass loss between the end of the
TDMAT purge and the end of the NH purge. 3
As labeled in Fig. 7, m is the net apparent mass0
deposited by the TDMAT exposure at the end of the
TDMAT purge. m qm is the net apparent mass depos-01
ited following the NH purge and m is the apparent31
mass change produced by the NH exposure. Fig. 8 3

plots the QCM mass ratio, Rs(m qm )ym , for each010
of the timing sequences and temperatures shown in Fig.
6. For the short pulses, R increases with increasing
temperature. The R values for the medium and long
pulse sequences are nearly identical and are consistently
larger than theR values for the short pulse sequence.
For the medium and long pulse sequences, the R values
increase with increasing deposition temperature except
for an initial drop between 60 and 908C.
3.3. Film properties
The ex situ measurements of film resistivity using the
four-point probe are shown in Fig. 9. The resistivity
dramatically decreases vs. deposition temperature. The
resistivities are also consistently smaller for the short
reactant pulses. The smallest resistivity of 1.4=10 4
mV cm is obtained at 240 8C with the short reactant
pulses. This resistivity is considerably higher than the
bulk TiN resistivity of 22mV cm.
The TiN film thicknesses were measured after depo-
sition using a surface profilometer. The in situ QCM
results for the deposited film mass were then used
together with the ex situ film thicknesses to derive the
film density . These film densities are shown in Fig. 10.
The densities derived from the QCM and surface profi-
lometer measurements are very small at low deposition
temperature and increase progressively at higher depo-
sition temperature. In addition, these densities are con-
sistently higher for the short reactant pulses. The QCM
and surface profilometer measurements reveal that the
highest density of 3.0 gycm is obtained at 240 8C for3
the short reactant pulses. This density is considerably
smaller than the bulk TiN density of 5.22 g ycm . 3
The low densities observed in Fig. 10 correspond to
high film porosity . The right axis of Fig. 10 shows the
film porosity vs. deposition temperature for the three

reactant exposures calculated using: porosity (% )s
100 =(1 ydy5.22 ) where d is the corresponding film
density . As expected based on the densities, higher
porosities are measured at lower deposition tempera-
tures. The lowest porosities are obtained at 2408C for
the short reactant pulses.
High film porosity may lead to facile film oxidation.
Fig. 11 shows the chemical composition in atomic
percentage measured using ex situ XPS analysis. The
XPS measurements in Fig. 11a were performed on TiN
ALD films deposited on Si(100 ) using the short pulse
sequence at deposition temperatures of 60–240 8C. Fig.
11b shows XPS measurements vs. TDMAT exposure
for the short, medium and long pulse sequences meas-
ured for TiN ALD films deposited on Si(100 ) at 180
8C. These XPS measurements reveal that the TiN films
are highly oxidized after TiN growth at low temperature.
Oxygen is still the dominant film constituent even after
TiN growth at 2408C using the short reactant pulses.
This high level of film oxidation may explain the high
resistivity values shown in Fig. 9.
Grazing incidence XRD was performed on the TiN
ALD films deposited on Si (100 ) and soda-lime glass
substrates. T wo weak, broad peaks were observed in the
diffraction patterns at 2us36.5 and 42.9 8. Under-stoi-
chiometric TiN films exhibit strong reflections at 2 us0.7
36.69 and 42.62 8. Consequently , the XRD measurements
suggest that the ALD TiN films are weakly crystalline
and rich in titanium.
The surface morphology of the TiN ALD films
deposited on Si (100 ) substrates was examined using
AFM. The TiN ALD films exhibited a topography
typical of amorphous films and were relatively smooth.
For instance, the root mean squared (RMS ) surface
roughness of the TiN ALD films with a thickness of
800 A deposited using the short reactant pulse sequence˚
at 180 8C was 10 A. The RMS roughness of the TiN˚
ALD films increased with film thickness, deposition
temperature and reactant exposure times.
4. Discussion
4.1. Surface chemistry during TiN ALD
The proposed reaction mechanism for TiN ALD is
given by Eqs. (3 ) and (4 ). This reaction mechanism is
supported by the FTIR results presented in Figs. 1–3.

The number of dimethylamine molecules produced during the TDMAT reaction is xs1 ,2o r3 .
Fig. 1 shows that when the TiN surface covered with
NH * species is exposed to TDMAT, the NH * speciesxx
are replaced by Ti (N (CH )) * species. Similarly , Fig.32 x
2 displays that the Ti (N (CH )) * species are exchanged32 x
for NH * species upon subsequent exposure to NH .x 3
Fig. 3 illustrates that the TDMAT and NH surface 3
reactions are nearly self-limiting. These findings imply
that repeating the reactions given by Eqs. (3 ) and (4 )
in a binary ABAB « sequence should produce atomic
layer controlled growth of TiN films.
The FTIR spectra also reveal some problems for TiN
ALD using TDMAT and NH . The vibrational spectra 3
reveal that the dimethylamino species are progressively
building up in the growing TiN film. The integrated
absorbance for the C–H stretching vibrations from the
Ti(N (CH )) * species increases progressively after32 x
each successive NH exposure in the ABAB «sequence.3
These residual dimethylamino species may lead to lower
film densities and facilitate the oxidation of the TiN
film upon air exposure.
The FTIR spectra do not observe the growth of
distinct TiN infrared absorption features that increase
progressively with the sequential TDMAT and NH 3
exposures. However, there is a progressive increase in
the background infrared absorption that is consistent
with the deposition of a conducting TiN film. Evidence
for the slow, non-self-limiting adsorption of TDMAT
during TiN ALD is also provided by the continuous
increase in the background infrared absorption following
large TDMAT exposures. This rise in background
absorbance persists even after the C–H stretching vibra-
tions from the Ti(N (CH )) * species have reached their32 x
maximum absorbance values.
The variations in the QCM mass ratio, R, with
temperature and exposure shown in Fig. 8 can be
employed to evaluate the TiN ALD surface chemistry .
Table 1 presents three different possible TiN ALD
reaction sequences derived from Eqs.(3 ) and (4 ) where
the number of dimethylamine molecules produced dur-
ing the TDMAT reaction is varied fromxs1, 2 and 3.
The Ti atom also changes its oxidation number from 4
to 3 during the NH reaction to obtain the correct3
oxidation number in bulk TiN.
The surface species remaining after the NH reaction 3
for xs1 is given as NTiNH*. This species requires a
double bond between the Ti atom and the NH ligand to
obtain a Ti oxidation number of 3. However, there
should be no double bonds in the TiN film. T o avoid
the double bond, adjacent NTiNH* species could rear-
range to form a«Ti–NH–Ti–NH–Ti « structure where
no double bonds are present. A rearrangement is also
required during the NH reaction forxs3 to obtain a3
Ti oxidation number of 3. This rearrangement yields the
N TiNH * and NH* species.22

corresponding to the three possible reaction sequences.

formula may be written: Rs62 y(224 y45 x). The solid

The number of dimethylamino ligands incorporated into the film during the NH reaction is ys0 ,1o r2 .3
the reaction mechanism given by Eqs. (3 ) and (4 ). The
vertical axis in Fig. 12 shows the range of R values
observed experimentally in Fig. 8. Fig. 12 demonstrates
that theR values predicted by Eqs. (3 ) and (4 ) do not
span the observed range of R values. Predicted QCM
mass ratios R)0.6 are observed only for x)2.6. The
maximum R value of R;0.7 is obtained at xs3.0.
Alternate reaction mechanisms were evaluated to
explain the QCM mass ratio results. The simplest reac-
tion mechanism that explained the observations assumes
that some of the dimethylamino ligands on the TDMAT
molecule are incorporated into the growing TiN film.
Table 2 lists three possible reaction sequences where the
number of dimethylamino ligands incorporated into the
film is equal toys0, 1 and 2. The number of dimethy-
lamine molecules released during the TDMAT reaction
is assumed to bexs2. The third column in Table 2 lists
the corresponding QCM mass ratios and demonstrates
thatR increases with y.
The general formula for the QCM mass ratio including
dimethylamino incorporation is: Rs(62 q44 y)y(224 y
45 x) with the constraints: 1 (x(3 and y((4 yx). The
R values predicted by this formula are displayed in Fig.
12 for ys0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. Fig. 12 shows that
the R values predicted by the dimethylamino ligand
incorporation mechanism span the full range of experi-
mentally observedR values.
The FTIR and QCM measurements both suggest that
dimethylamino ligands may be incorporated in the TiN
films. Fig. 12 shows thatR is expected to increase with
increasing dimethylamino ligand incorporation. Fig. 8
indicates that increasing deposition temperature and
exposure times increasesR. These similar trends suggest
that TiN ALD performed at higher temperatures and
larger exposure times may incorporate more dimethy-
lamino ligands. In agreement with this expectation, Fig.
11a shows that the C and N atomic percentage of the
TiN ALD films increase with increasing deposition
temperature. Likewise, Fig. 11b displays that the C
atomic percentage increases slightly with increasing
exposure times.
In addition to dimethylamino incorporation, TiN ALD
may be affected by adsorbed NH . The long purge times 3
required following NH exposures may result from the3
adsorption of NH on the TiN surfaces on the QCM and3
the reactor walls. Previous laser-induced thermal desorp-
tion measurements found that NH persists on TiN3
surfaces under UHV conditions to temperatures of 177
8C w19 x. The mass transient observed during the NH 3
exposure in Fig. 7 is consistent with the adsorption and
desorption of molecular NH . Assuming a density for 3
condensed NH of 0.68 g ycm or 2.41 =10 molecules y32 2
3
cm w26 x, one ML of NH corresponds to 23 ng ycm y32
3
cycle. Therefore, the ;80 ng ycm mass increase2
corresponds to ;3.5 ML NH . Fig. 10 demonstrates3
that the TiN ALD films are porous. Consequently , the
3.5 ML of NH may be adsorbed within the porous TiN3
film.
4.2. TiN ALD growth rate
One ML of TiN has an estimated thickness of d sy1 y3
2.7 A and would yield a mass deposition rate of 141˚
ng ycm ycycle. Fig. 6 reveals that TiN ALD growth2
rates )1 ML are measured for the long exposures at
the highest growth temperatures. These large growth
rates are attributed to the non-self-limiting adsorption of
TDMAT and TiN CVD from TDMAT thermal decom-
position that occurs at temperatures)180 8C. Fig. 5a
also demonstrates non-self-limiting adsorption of
TDMAT at lower temperatures of 1208C. Furthermore,
the continual increase in the FTIR background absorp-
tion observed following large TDMAT exposures at 152
8C also suggests non-self-limited growth.
The activation energies measured for TiN ALD are
consistent with previous measurements of the TDMAT
surface reactions. Previously , an activation energy of
0.15 eV was measured for TiN low pressure CVD using
TDMAT and NHw16,17 x. This value is similar to the3
activation energies of 0.12–0.13 eV shown in Fig. 6 for
the short reactant pulses and the medium and long
reactant pulses below 1508C. This similarity suggests
that the TiN ALD and low pressure TiN CVD share a
common rate-limiting step. TiN ALD is similar to low
pressure TiN CVD because gas phase reactions are not
involved during the TiN growth. The larger activation
energies measured for the medium and long exposures
at temperatures)180 8C are consistent with TiN CVD

155J.W. Elam et al. / Thin Solid Films 436 (2003) 145–156
by thermal decomposition of TDMAT. Activation ener-
gies of 0.8 eV have been previously measured for TiN
CVD by TDMAT decompositionw27 x.
The TiN ALD growth rates can be used to determine
the TDMAT reactive sticking coefficient during TiN
ALD. The reactive sticking coefficient is given by Ss
QyF. Q is the deposited coverage of Ti atoms measured
after a TDMAT exposure and F is the number of
TDMAT molecular collisions corresponding to the same
TDMAT exposure.Q can be determined from Fig. 5a
and F is obtained from gas kinetic theory . The initial
reactive sticking coefficient calculated from Fig. 5a is
Ss9 =10 . In comparison, the reaction probabilityy3
reported for TDMAT thermal decomposition on a
TiN C surface at 200 8Ci s ;10 w28 x.y3
xy
The TiN ALD growth rates shown in Fig. 6 can also
be compared with earlier TiN ALD growth rates
obtained using the titanium halide or titanium organo-
metallic precursors. TiN ALD growth rates of 0.17 and
0.32 Aycycle are measured at 500 8C using TiCl w5 x4˚
and TiI w8 x, respectively . In comparison, earlier reports4
of TiN ALD using TEMAT w9 x and TDMAT w11 x
yielded TiN ALD growth rates of 5.0 and 4.3 A ycycle,˚
respectively , at 180 8C. These large TiN ALD growth
rates were interpreted in terms of additional TEMAT or
TDMAT reactant adsorption on the growing TiN surface
w9,11 x.
The additional TEMAT or TDMAT reactants are
believed to be adsorbed to the TiN surface following
the completion of the surface reactionw9,11 x. The
adsorption of these Lewis bases is reasonable given the
strong Lewis acid Ti sites on the TiN surface. Earlier3 q
studies have also demonstrated that Lewis bases such
as HN (CH ) and NH both can adsorb to the growing32 3
TiN surface w19 x. The adsorbed TEMAT or TDMAT
reactants then react with NH during the subsequent 3
NH exposure and yield larger TiN ALD growth rates.3
Although the adsorption of additional TEMAT or
TDMAT reactants on the TiN surface is reasonable,
lower TiN ALD growth rates would be predicted at
higher temperatures. Lower TiN ALD growth rates are
expected because the adsorbed reactant coverage should
decrease with temperature. The opposite trend is
observed in Fig. 6. In addition, the QCM mass ratios
during TDMAT and NH exposures are inconsistent3
with additional adsorbed TDMAT reactants persisting
on the growing TiN film. Consequently , the large TiN
ALD growth rates at higher temperatures are attributed
to TDMAT thermal decomposition.
4.3. TiN ALD film properties
The TiN ALD films have a very high resistivity that
decreases dramatically with growth temperature. The
densities of the TiN ALD films are also extremely low .
The TiN films have porosities that range from 80 to
42% depending on the growth temperature and reactant
exposure length. These high porosities probably lead to
the very high oxygen levels observed in the TiN film
after air exposure. This assumption could be verified by
depositing an Al O ALD capping layer onto the TiN23
film prior to air exposure and subsequently analyzing
the TiN film using depth-profiling XPS. The high
porosity will seriously compromise the ability of these
TiN ALD films to serve as effective diffusion barriers.
These porous TiN films are not expected to be effective
diffusion barriers for copper. Likewise, the high porosi-
ties allow easy oxidation of the TiN films and raise the
film resistivity . This high resistivity is also not desirable
for a diffusion barrier for backend multilevel
interconnects.
The earlier studies of TiN ALD using the TEMAT
titanium organometallic precursor reported TiN growth
rates based on surface profilometry measurements w9 x.
Related studies using TDMAT implied that the results
for TEMAT and TDMAT were similar w11 x. Unfortu-
nately , these earlier studies did not measure TiN ALD
film densities. In addition, the earlier reports did not
report the oxygen levels in the TiN ALD films. Either
of these measurements would have been able to uncover
the high porosity and facile oxidation of these TiN ALD
films.
T o examine the differences between TiN ALD using
titanium halide and titanium organometallic precursors,
a TiN ALD film was grown using 500 cycles of TiCl 4
and NH at 450 8C. This TiN ALD film was then3
examined using the four-point probe. The TiN film
grown using TiCl and NH had a resistivity of 14043
mV cm. This resistivity compares well with the resistiv-
ities measured earlier for TiN films deposited using
TiCl and NHw5 x. This similarity argues that the higher43
resistivities for the TiN ALD films using TDMAT and
NH result from the surface chemistry of the TDMAT3
precursor. The higher resistivity cannot be attributed to
problems with the viscous flow ALD reactor.
Preliminary results indicate that ex situ hydrogen
radical exposure to the TiN ALD films significantly
reduces the resistivity . The hydrogen reduction probably
partially eliminates oxygen and produces a higher purity
TiN film. In situ hydrogen radical exposure may also
promote the growth of higher density , lower porosity
TiN ALD films. The density of TaN ALD films grown
using tantalum organometallics has been reported to be
increased using hydrogen radical exposuresw29 x. The
hydrogen radicals may help remove the dimethylamino
species and promote the crosslinking of –NH surface2
species that would densify the TiN ALD film.
5. Conclusions
TiN ALD was examined using sequential exposures
to TDMAT and NH . These investigations reveal that3

156 J.W. Elam et al. / Thin Solid Films 436 (2003) 145–156
TiN ALD using TDMAT and NH does not exhibit ideal 3
ALD behavior. The surface chemistry was investigated
using in situ FTIR and QCM techniques. The film
properties were explored using ex situ four-point probe,
surface profilometry , XPS, XRD and AFM analyses.
The FTIR measurements were consistent with TiN ALD
occurring via surface exchange reactions. TDMAT mol-
ecules react with NH * species to deposit newx
Ti (N (CH )) * surface species. The subsequent expo-32 x
sure to NH removes most of the Ti (N (CH )) * surface33 2 x
species and restores the initial NH * species. However, x
the inability of the NH exposure to remove all the 3
dimethylamino species leads to the buildup of carbon
species in the TiN film. The FTIR measurements also
revealed a progressive increase in the background
absorption during TDMAT exposure that was consistent
with a slow, non-self-limiting TDMAT reaction.
QCM measurements revealed that sequential TDMAT
and NH exposures allow stepwise TiN film growth.3
The TDMAT and NH surface reactions are nearly self-3
limiting. However, large TDMAT exposures generate a
slow, continual growth of ;0.05 ng ycm ys at 120 8C.2
QCM studies determined that the activation energy for
TiN ALD was 0.12 ("0.01 ) eV using short exposures.
Using long exposures at deposition temperatures )150
8C, the activation energy increases to 0.57 ("0.09 ) eV
and approaches the activation energy for TDMAT ther-
mal decomposition. The TiN ALD films displayed a
very high resistivity that was correlated with high film
porosity and high oxygen content after air exposure.
The high porosities may be partially attributed to the
incomplete reactivity of NH with the dimethylamino 3
surface species. These high porosities and high resistiv-
ities will compromise the use of TiN ALD from TDMAT
and NH for depositing diffusion barriers.3
