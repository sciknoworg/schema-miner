Al2O3 films were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at temperatures as low as 33
°C in a viscous-flow reactor using alternating exposures of Al(CH3)3 (trimethylaluminum
[TMA]) and H2O. Low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films have the potential to coat thermally
fragile substrates such as organic, polymeric, or biological materials. The properties of lowtemperature Al2O3 ALD films were investigated versus growth temperature by depositing
films on Si(100) substrates and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors. Al2O3 film
thicknesses, growth rates, densities, and optical properties were determined using surface
profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), QCM, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Al2O3
film densities were lower at lower deposition temperatures. Al2O3 ALD film densities were
3.0 g/cm3 at 177 °C and 2.5 g/cm3 at 33 °C. AFM images showed that Al2O3 ALD films grown
at low temperatures were very smooth with a root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of only
4 ( 1 Å. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements showed good electrical
properties of the low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films. Elemental analysis of the films using
forward recoil spectrometry revealed hydrogen concentrations that increased with decreasing
growth temperature. No other elements were observed by Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry except the parent aluminum and oxygen concentrations. Low-temperature Al2O3
ALD at 58 °C was demonstrated for the first time on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
polymeric substrate. Al2O3 ALD coatings on PET bottles resulted in reduced CO2 gas
permeabilities.

1. Introduction
The coating of thermally fragile substrates by atomic
layer deposition (ALD) may provide exciting new applications of ALD in diverse areas ranging from food
packaging to microelectronics to biomaterials. For example, thin ALD films may serve as gas diffusion
barriers in food packaging and extend shelf life by
decreasing oxygen diffusion through potato chip bags
or slowing the escape of CO2 from pressurized soda
containers.1,2 ALD coatings on polymers may also be
important as gas diffusion barriers for flexible electronic
devices or organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).3,4
However, few ALD processes have been demonstrated
at low temperatures of <100 °C. Room-temperature
catalytic SiO2 ALD has been demonstrated with SiCl4
and H2O plus pyridine5 or NH36 as the catalyst. ALD of
ZnSe and CdS has also been demonstrated at room

temperature.7 The vast majority of ALD processes occur
at temperatures of >100 °C that would degrade organic,
polymeric, or biological material.
Al2O3 is one of the most widely studied materials
grown by ALD.8-17 Al2O3 is a well-behaved ALD system
that can be accomplished with a variety of precursors
and relatively short cycle times. The effect of growth
temperature on the properties of Al2O3 ALD films has
been studied at temperatures ranging from 125 to 500
°C.11-16 For microelectronics applications, desired properties such as high dielectric constant and low impurity
concentration have been found to be optimized at a
growth temperature of ∼350 °C.11 Little is known about
Al2O3 ALD at low temperatures (e100 °C) and the

properties of such films. This study explores the conditions necessary for low-temperature Al2O3 ALD and
examines the properties of the resulting films. Lowtemperature Al2O3 ALD was also applied for the first
time to a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) polymer
substrate. Reduced gas permeabilities were observed for
Al2O3 ALD-coated PET bottles.
2. Experimental Section
A. Chemicals and Substrates. Al2O3 ALD films were
grown using H2O (Fisher, optima grade) and Al(CH3)3 [trimethylaluminum (TMA)] (Akzo-Nobel, semiconductor grade,
99.9999%). The carrier gas in the viscous flow reactor was N2
(Airgas, ultrahigh purity). Moderately doped n-type Si(100)
wafers from Montco Silicon Technologies, Inc., with a boron
doping density of ∼2 × 1017 cm-3 were used as substrates.
A variety of chemicals were used for etching and cleaning
of the Si substrates. These chemicals included 5% HF (general
chemicals class 10 water/HF (10:1) mix), water (HPLC grade),
sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide (30%). Prior to deposition,
the silicon wafers were cut into ∼2.5 cm × 2.5 cm pieces,
cleaned in a ∼60 °C Piranha solution for 15 min, and then
HF etched for 60 s.
For gas diffusion tests, uncoated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles were supplied by Applied Films Corp. The
bottles were 510-mL Coke Contour bottles. These PET bottles
had a weight of 28 g and a petalloid shaped base. The PET
bottles were cleaned with Micro cleaner/oxide remover (International Products Corp.) prior to deposition.
B. Al2O3 ALD Film Growth in Viscous-Flow Reactor.
Al2O3 films were grown by ALD in a viscous-flow ALD reactor.
This reactor has been described in detail in other publications.11,17 TMA and H2O were alternately entrained in the N2
carrier flow using gas switching valves.17 The N2 carrier gas
pressure was ∼1.0 Torr. TMA and H2O pressure transient
increases of ∼0.1 Torr were measured by a Baratron when the
reactants were introduced into the N2 carrier flow.
The Al2O3 ALD film growth proceeded according to two selflimiting surface reactions. The TMA and H2O yield Al2O3 ALD
according to the following two reactions:9,10

(A) Al-OH* + Al(CH3)3 f Al-O-Al(CH3)2* + CH4
(B) Al-CH3* + H2O f Al-OH* + CH4
where the asterisks denote the surface species. When performed in an ABAB... reaction sequence, these sequential
reactions produce linear, atomic-layer controlled Al2O3 growth.
Many previous studies have confirmed linear and conformal
growth using TMA and H2O.9,11,15,17
The standard flow tube was used to deposit Al2O3 ALD films
on Si substrates or the QCM.17 Figure 1 shows the reactor with
a larger-than-normal flow tube designed to accommodate the
PET bottles. Figure 1 also shows a simplified diagram of the

Groner et al.
gas switching valves and the gas reservoirs. The gas switching
valves allow for a rapid turn-on and shut-off of the reactant
gases for short ALD cycle times. This short time is facilitated
by pumping the gas reservoirs with separate mechanical
pumps after the reactant exposures.17
The time for one complete Al2O3 ALD cycle ranged from 12
s at 177 °C to 203 s at 33 °C. This cycle time was defined by
(t1, t2, t3, t4) where t1 is the TMA exposure time, t2 is the N2
purge time following the TMA reactant exposure, t3 is the H2O
exposure time, and t4 is the N2 purge time following the H2O
reactant exposure. All times are in units of seconds. Longer
purge times were required at lower temperatures to avoid
Al2O3 chemical vapor deposition (CVD) resulting from insufficient purge times.
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies of Al2O3 ALD
were performed in situ using a Maxtek TM400 thin-film
deposition monitor. The QCM crystal housing was sealed and
purged to prevent deposition on the backside and positioned
horizontally in the flow reactor tube. A detailed description of
the QCM for monitoring ALD has been presented in a previous
publication.17
Al2O3 ALD films were deposited on PET bottles at 58 °C.
To accommodate the 510-mL PET bottles, the standard reactor
flow tube was replaced with a larger 10-cm diameter tube as
shown in Figure 1. This tube consisted of the bottom halves
of two vacuum traps joined by an O-ring and a clamp. The
bottles were suspended in this enlarged reactor tube by a
custom-made cap and purge line that allowed the bottle to be
pressurized with N2 gas during Al2O3 ALD. The pressurization
prevented bottle deformation during and after the Al2O3 ALD
film growth.
C. Al2O3 Film Characterization. Al2O3 film thicknesses
and refractive indices were measured using a J. A. Woollam
M44 variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE). Measurements were obtained over the spectral range from 406 to
806 nm using an incidence angle of 75°. Al2O3 and SiO2 have
virtually identical optical constants. Consequently, a simple
ellipsometric measurement yields only the sum of the Al2O3
and SiO2 film thicknesses. To determine the true Al2O3
thickness and the thickness of any interfacial SiO2 layer on
Si(100), a procedure was employed that utilized simultaneous
Al2O3 ALD growth on both an HF-etched Si wafer and a Si
wafer with a native oxide. This procedure was described in
detail in another publication.11 A 13 ( 2 Å thick interfacial
SiO2 layer was determined to be present at the Al2O3/Si
interface after Al2O3 ALD. This SiO2 thickness was subtracted
from the ellipsometric measurements to determine the Al2O3
layer thickness.
Atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the Al2O3 films
and substrates were obtained using an AutoProbe CP Research
scanning probe microscope (SPM) instrument from ThermoMicroscopes. RMS surface roughness values were calculated
on the basis of 1 µm2 contact-mode AFM scans. Profilometry
was performed using a Dektak 3 surface profile measuring
system from Veeco Metrology Group. Al2O3 film thicknesses
were determined by measuring step heights using profilometry
and contact-mode AFM. Well-defined steps needed for AFM
imaging were created by masking part of the sample with a
small piece of high-temperature aluminum foil tape (3M, Type
433) during Al2O3 ALD. Other methods, such as clamping
another piece of silicon to the substrate, were found to produce
poorly defined steps that were too wide to be imaged by AFM.
Electrical measurements were performed using a MDC 811
mercury probe from the Materials Development Corporation.
These electrical measurements have been described in another
publication.11 The mercury probe makes contact to the front
surface of the Al2O3 films by drawing up a well-defined column
of Hg with a surface area of 0.437 mm2. Current-voltage (IV)
measurements were obtained using a Keithley 487 picoammeter/voltage source. Capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements were performed using a Stanford Research Systems
SR720 LCR meter. The experiments were computer-controlled
using LabView from National Instruments.
Elemental analysis was performed at the Ion Beam Analysis
Laboratory in the Institute of Technology Characterization

Facility at the University of Minnesota. Al and O were
determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS)
using a 3.5 MeV 4He2+ and 2.4 MeV 4He+ beam, respectively.
H was determined by 1.3 MeV 4He+ forward recoil spectrometry (FReS). The instrument is composed of a NEC 1.7 MV
Pelletron accelerator with a Charles Evans RBS 400 endstation. The He beam incident angle was 75°. The RBS detector
was located at 165° and the FReS detector was located at 30°
from the beam direction. A 5-µm- thick Mylar foil was placed
in front of the FReS detector to filter the scattered 4He
particles. The error was estimated at less than 5%.
X-ray reflectivity (XRR) was performed with a Bede Scientific Ltd. D1 System using a channel cut crystal. The X-ray
wavelength from the Cu KR X-ray tube was 1.54 Å. The
electron beam current in the X-ray tube was 20 mA at 35 kV.
A θ-2θ scan was performed with a 10-arcsec step size and a
5-s acquisition time. The Bede Refs software with a genetic
algorithm was used to fit the XRR data and calculate the
densities of the films.
Gas diffusion tests on the Al2O3 ALD-coated PET bottles
were performed by Applied Films Corporation using a GMS
barrier measurement system (Balzers Process Systems, GmbH).
The bottles were pressurized with up to 6 bar of CO2 gas. The
loss of CO2 was then measured over 3 to 4 days. The CO2 loss
rate of an Al2O3 ALD-coated PET coated bottle was compared
with the CO2 loss rate of an uncoated bottle. This ratio of these
loss rates determined the CO2 barrier improvement factor
(BIF).

3. Results
A. Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Al2O3 ALD was
characterized at different growth temperatures from 33
to 177 °C using a QCM. Figure 2 shows Al2O3 ALD at
58 °C using a (1, 10, 2, 30) cycle time. The Al2O3 ALD
film growth is very linear with number of AB reaction
cycles. A mass gain per cycle of 30 ng/cm2 was measured
for the Al2O3 ALD growth shown in Figure 2. A more
detailed view of the QCM data is shown in Figure 3.
The QCM data for three ALD cycles shows the mass
gain for each TMA and water exposure. The time
periods during which the TMA and H2O dosing valves
were open are denoted by the shaded regions. A larger
mass gain is observed during the TMA exposure than
during the H2O exposure. This behavior is similar to
that previously observed during QCM studies of Al2O3
ALD at 177 °C.17
The QCM data were used to determine the optimal
reactant exposures and nitrogen purge times for Al2O3
ALD at low temperatures. At 177 °C, QCM data from
this work and a previous study17 showed that 1-s
exposure times and 5-s purge times were sufficient for

The shaded areas show the time periods during which the
TMA and water dosing valves were open. The mass increases
coincide with the TMA and water exposures.

complete reaction and purging of all of the reactants to
prevent CVD. Both the required exposure times and
purge times increased with decreasing temperatures.
The dependence of the Al2O3 ALD mass gain on
reactant exposure time at 58 °C is shown in Figure 4.
These curves were obtained by monitoring QCM data
while varying the individual reactant exposure times
to determine the minimum precursor exposures necessary for the TMA and H2O reactions to reach completion. Figure 5 shows the effect of purge times on the
Al2O3 ALD growth rates. Purge times were chosen to
be long enough to avoid reactant mixing and subsequent
CVD. The CVD growth is indicated by the rise in mass
gain per cycle at short purge times. On the basis of these
studies, the optimal cycle time for Al2O3 ALD growth
at 58 °C was (1, 10, 2, 30) where all times are in units
of seconds.
QCM experiments confirmed that Al2O3 ALD is possible at temperatures as low as 33 °C. This temperature
was the lowest temperature that could be achieved
without actively cooling the viscous flow reactor. However, the required H2O purge time was 180 s at 33 °C.
Table 1 shows the reactant exposure and purge times
used to perform Al2O3 ALD at growth temperatures
ranging from 33 to 177 °C. The resulting Al2O3 ALD
mass gains per cycle determined by the QCM are also
given in Table 1.

QCM measurements indicated a maximum mass gain
per cycle of 39 ng/cm2 at 125 °C. A slight decrease to 38
ng/cm2 in the mass gain per cycle was measured at 177
°C. Below 125 °C, the mass gain per cycle decreases with
decreasing growth temperature and reaches a value of
30 ng/cm2 at 33 °C.
B. Spectroscopic Ellipsometry. Al2O3 ALD film
thicknesses and the refractive index, n, were determined
at wavelengths from 406 to 806 nm using spectroscopic
ellipsometry. For Al2O3 films grown using 300 reaction
cycles, the film thickness increased from 332 Å at 33
°C to 401 Å at 125 °C. The film thickness then decreased
slightly to 375 Å at 177 °C. These measurements yield
Al2O3 ALD growth rates of 1.11, 1.34, and 1.25 Å/cycle,
respectively. Al2O3 ALD growth rates over the entire
growth temperature range are given in Figure 6.
The refractive indices decreased slightly with decreasing growth temperature. The results of these measurements are also shown in Figure 6. The refractive indices
varied by <1% over the spectral range from 406 to 806
nm. Consequently, the analysis was performed by
assuming that the refractive index was constant over
the entire wavelength range. The maximum refractive
index was n ) 1.60 at 177 °C. The refractive index
decreased to n ) 1.51 at 33 °C. Figure 6 also shows the
density of the Al2O3 ALD films calculated on the basis
of the QCM mass measurements and the ellipsometric
Al2O3 film thicknesses.
C. Profilometry, Atomic Force Microscopy, and
X-ray Reflectivity. Profilometry and AFM were used
as independent measures of Al2O3 ALD film thicknesses.
Figure 7 shows a 10 × 10 µm2 AFM image used to
determine the thickness of an Al2O3 ALD film grown at

ALD. The average step height in this image is 43 nm.
Film thicknesses determined by profilometry and AFM
were within (10% of the thicknesses derived by the
ellipsometric measurements.
AFM was also used to determine the surface roughness of the Al2O3 ALD films. The low-temperature Al2O3
ALD films were all very smooth. The root-mean-squared
(RMS) surface roughness for a 1 × 1 µm2 area averaged
4 ( 1 Å. Growth temperature did not affect this surface
roughness. The roughness of these films is also similar
to that of Al2O3 ALD films grown at higher temperatures.9,18
XRR scans for Al2O3 ALD films grown on Si(100)
using 300 reaction cycles at temperatures from 33 to
177 °C are shown in Figure 8. The XRR scans were
fitted to determine densities of the Al2O3 ALD films.
These fits are also shown in Figure 8. The density of
the Al2O3 ALD films derived by fitting the XRR measurements decreased from 3.06 g/cm3 at 177 °C to 2.46
g/cm3 at 33 °C. The XRR density results and comparison
of all the density results are shown in Figure 9.

IV curve characteristics remained relatively constant
versus growth temperature. Low leakage current densities of <10-7 nA/cm2 at a 5 V bias were measured even
for Al2O3 ALD films grown at 33 °C. Growth temperature did not appear to affect the leakage currents.
The catastrophic breakdown field decreased slightly
with decreasing growth temperature as shown in Figure
10. The breakdown field was 4.4 MV/cm at 177 °C and
decreased to 3.7 MV/cm at 33 °C. In addition, there was
a decrease in the percentage of spots tested that
exhibited good insulating behavior at lower growth
temperatures. Capacitance measurements revealed no
observable trend versus growth temperature. Figure 10
reveals that the dielectric constants of the Al2O3 ALD

films averaged k ) 7.7(0.4 over the entire temperature
range.
E. Elemental Analysis. Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry (RBS) analysis measured O/Al ratios close
to the expected 1.5 value as shown in Figure 11. The
ratios ranged from 1.34 to 1.70. There was no systematic
trend with growth temperature. Hydrogen concentrations measured by forward recoil spectrometry (FReS)
increased with decreasing growth temperature as displayed in Figure 11. The H atom % in the Al2O3 ALD
films increased from 6.9% at 177 °C to 21.7% at 33 °C.
No other impurities were detected in the Al2O3 ALD
films within the detection limit of the RBS.
F. Gas Diffusion. Gas diffusion tests with CO2 were
carried out on PET bottles coated with Al2O3 ALD films.
Bottles were coated with 300 reaction cycles of Al2O3
ALD at 58 °C. This coating procedure should deposit a
Al2O3 ALD film with a thickness of 360 Å. The CO2 gas
diffusion test revealed a CO2 loss rate of 1.55% per
week, or 2.91 cm3/(day bar cm2). This CO2 loss rate for
the Al2O3 ALD-coated bottle is a factor of ∼1.6 lower
than the CO2 loss rate of an uncoated PET bottle. The
ratio of these two CO2 loss rates yields a barrier
improvement factor (BIF) of ∼1.6.
Volumetric measurements of the PET bottles showed
no change in volume as a result of Al2O3 ALD at 58 °C.
PET bottles were also coated with 282 and 470 reaction
cycles of Al2O3 ALD at a growth temperature of 80 °C
and without the N2 gas pressurization. These PET
bottles deformed and increased in volume during deposition. The barrier improvements factors for these Al2O3
ALD-coated PET bottles were much smaller.
4. Discussion
A. Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) Measurements. QCM studies showed that both the reactant
exposure times and the nitrogen purge times required
for Al2O3 ALD increased with decreasing temperatures.
Longer reactant exposures at low temperatures are
expected because the reaction is thermally activated.10
The purging of reactants, especially H2O, takes longer
at low temperatures because of slower desorption of H2O
from the reactor walls at lower temperatures.
The completion of the reactions took longer and
became less defined, or “softer”, at lower temperatures.
This “soft” saturation is revealed by the small slope for
the mass gain per cycle versus TMA and H2O exposure
at longer exposure times in Figure 4. These small slopes

644

Chem. Mater., Vol. 16, No. 4, 2004

indicate that either a complete reaction may not have
been achieved or that the purge times may have become
insufficient. Unfortunately, trying to achieve a complete
reaction using reactant exposures of tens of seconds is
inefficient in terms of time and reactant usage.
The maximum QCM mass gain per cycle of 39 ng/
cm2 was recorded at 125 °C as shown in Table 1. QCM
measurements can be employed to calculate film thicknesses. These thickness calculations rely on known
density values. For amorphous materials such as the
Al2O3 ALD films grown at low temperatures, the density
may change with growth temperature. Consequently,
additional independent thickness measurements are
required to derive the density from the QCM mass
measurements.
B. Thickness Measurements and Al2O3 ALD
Growth Rates. The agreement between the different
methods of measuring Al2O3 ALD film thicknesses is
quite good. Ellipsometric data exhibit less scatter than
most of the other methods. The growth rate versus
growth temperature obtained by ellipsometry displays
a very smooth dependence in Figure 6. However, ellipsometry data depend on fitting several parameters to
obtain a film thickness. This modeling can also be
complicated by the presence of an interfacial SiO2
layer.11 Profilometry and AFM step height measurements are more direct determinations of film thickness
but tend to be less precise. These measurements depend
on the presence of a well-defined, sharp step edge that
is not always easy to obtain. However, the film thicknesses obtained by profilometry and AFM agreed fairly
well with the film thicknesses obtained by ellipsometry
and XRR methods.
The Al2O3 ALD growth rates shown in Figure 6 reach
a maximum of 1.33 Å/cycle at 100 and 125 °C. A
previous study observed the maximum Al2O3 ALD
growth rate of 1.1 Å/cycle at 177 °C.9 The position of
this maximum was explained by the thermal activation
required for the reaction at lower temperatures and
decreasing Al-OH and Al-CH3 surface coverages at
higher temperatures.9 The growth rate is determined
by reaction kinetics and necessary surface species.9,10
There are higher surface coverages at low temperatures,
but slower reaction kinetics because of the thermal
activation barrier. The reaction kinetics are more rapid
at higher temperatures, but the growth rate is limited
by the lower surface coverages.
C. Density. Figure 9 shows the densities of the Al2O3
ALD films as determined by a number of different
methods. Densities were calculated on the basis of QCM,
AFM, ellipsometry, profilometry, XRR, and RBS/FReS
data. The density of the Al2O3 ALD films decreased with
decreasing growth temperature based on all the different methods. Furthermore, the density values derived
from the different methods agree fairly well with each
other. Average densities ranged from 3.0 g/cm3 at 177
°C to 2.5 g/cm3 at 33 °C.
The densities of these low-temperature Al2O3 ALD
films are significantly lower than the 3.5-3.7 g/cm3
value typically reported for amorphous Al2O3.19,20 The

density of 3.0 g/cm3 at 177 °C is also lower than the
density of 3.5 g/cm3 derived in a previous study of Al2O3
ALD films.9 That earlier study derived the density from
the refractive index of the film and the Lorentz-Lorenz
relationship assuming the optical constants of crystalline Al2O3. This assumption may not be correct because
the Al2O3 ALD film is amorphous. The data in the
current study are consistent with an average density
of 3.0 g/cm3 at 177 °C based on many different types of
measurements.
The density versus growth temperature has also been
calculated using the Lorentz-Lorenz relationship.9
Starting with the density of 3.0 g/cm3 at 177 °C,
densities for the Al2O3 ALD films grown at lower
temperature were determined on the basis of their
refractive indices, n. Figure 9 shows that the densities
derived using the Lorentz-Lorenz relationship yield
good agreement with the other Al2O3 ALD film densities.
D. Optical and Electrical Properties. Figure 6
shows that the refractive index of the Al2O3 ALD films
decreased slightly with decreasing growth temperatures. This trend has been reported elsewhere and was
attributed to decreased density and to increased impurity levels in films grown at lower temperatures.8,14 Figure 12 shows the refractive index of the low-temperature
Al2O3 ALD films compared with the refractive index of
Al2O3 ALD films measured in other studies.9,12-15,21
There is good agreement between the refractive indices
in the region of overlap between 150 and 200 °C.
The refractive index increases with increasing growth
temperature up to ∼300 °C. The refractive index is then
constant at n ≈ 1.67 for growth temperatures between
300 and 500 °C. For comparison, the crystalline R-Al2O3
sapphire form of alumina has a refractive index of n )
1.76.15 This comparison indicates that the amorphous
Al2O3 ALD film with n ≈ 1.67 will densify further upon
crystallization. This densification could lead to tensile
stress and film cracking.
IV and CV measurements revealed good electrical
properties for films grown at low temperatures. The
decreasing breakdown field with decreasing growth
temperature shown in Figure 10 may result from the
decreasing density or the increased hydrogen concentra(21) Kattelus, H.; Ylilammi, M.; Saarilahti, J.; Antson, J.; Lindfors,

tion in the Al2O3 ALD films grown at lower temperatures. Figure 10 also shows that the dielectric constant
did not decrease with decreasing growth temperatures.
However, the scatter in the measurements may have
masked a small change.
E. Film Composition. The RBS analysis of the Al2O3
ALD films obtained O/Al ratios close to the expected
ratio of 1.5. In addition, FReS analysis revealed hydrogen concentrations in Figure 11 that increased with
decreasing growth temperatures. The increasing hydrogen concentrations continue a trend that was observed
in a previous study for Al2O3 ALD growth temperatures
from 350 to 125 °C.11 The increasing hydrogen concentration at low temperatures may be directly related to
the lower density of the Al2O3 ALD films at lower
growth temperature.
At lower temperatures, the hydroxyl surface coverage
is higher on Al2O3 surfaces.9,10 In addition, the TMA
reaction with the Al-OH surface species groups does
not go to completion at low temperatures.9,10 During
Al2O3 ALD, the hydroxyl species can build up in the
growing Al2O3 film. At 180 °C, the hydroxyl concentration in the film after 10 AB cycles is equal to approximately the full hydroxyl coverage.10 Annealing at
1000 K can reduce hydroxyl accumulation in Al2O3 ALD
films.10 These previous studies support the idea that the
H atoms in the low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films are
present in the form of Al-OH species.
Despite the high hydrogen concentrations at low
temperatures, the Al2O3 ALD films still exhibited
remarkably good properties. Low-temperature Al2O3
ALD films may be used for various applications where
the high hydrogen concentration is not crucial. On the
basis of the results at 33 °C, growing Al2O3 ALD films
at room temperature is possible. The major problem is
slow H2O desorption from the reactor walls and very
long required H2O purge times. Shorter cycle times
could be achieved using a modified reactor design and
alternate oxygen sources such as N2O,22 NO2,16 or
alkoxides.23
F. Gas Diffusion Tests. The PET bottles coated with
300 reaction cycles of Al2O3 ALD at 58 °C displayed a
decrease in CO2 gas diffusion rates. However, lower CO2
diffusion rates and higher barrier improvement factors

(BIF) are desired for commercial applications. Light
microscopy images of the surface of the PET bottle
revealed apparent scratches and/or cracks on the surface
of the Al2O3 ALD-coated bottles. These scratches and/
or cracks may explain the low BIF for these Al2O3 ALD
films compared with typical BIFs for SiO2 coatings.24

5. Conclusions
Al2O3 ALD growth has been demonstrated at temperatures as low as 33 °C. Many of the properties of
these low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films were comparable with the properties of Al2O3 ALD films grown at
higher temperatures of g177 °C. The low-temperature
Al2O3 ALD films exhibited very low surface roughness
values, low leakage currents, high dielectric constants,
and growth rates in excess of 1 Å/cycle. Good thin film
properties were observed despite decreasing densities
and increasing hydrogen concentrations observed at
lower temperatures. Increased ALD cycle times were
necessary at lower temperatures because of the slower
reaction rates and longer required purge times for the
H2O reactant. Improvements in reactor design and the
use of alternate oxygen sources could help overcome this
problem. Low-temperature Al2O3 ALD may have applications for coating thermally fragile substrates such
as organic, polymeric, or biological material. As a
demonstration of the possible applications, low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films were grown on PET bottles to
reduce gas diffusion. The Al2O3 ALD-coated PET bottles
displayed lower CO2 gas diffusion rates than uncoated
PET bottles.
