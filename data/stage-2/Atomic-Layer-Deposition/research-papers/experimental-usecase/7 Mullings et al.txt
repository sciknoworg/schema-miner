Due to the abundance and usefulness of tin oxide for applications such as transparent conductors,
sensors, and catalysts, it is desirable to establish high quality atomic layer deposition (ALD) of this
material. ALD allows for uniform, conformal coating of complex topographies with ultrathin ﬁlms
and can broaden the applicability of tin oxide to systems such as nanostructured solar cells. The
present work examines the ALD of tin oxide by means of the precursor tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin
and water as a counter-reactant. Low temperature growth in the range of 30–200/C14 C on Si(100) and
glass substrates is studied. It is found that the growth rate increases with reduced temperature, up to
/C24 2.0 A˚/cycle at 30/C14 C, as compared to 0.70 A˚/cycle at 150/C14 C. The ALD process is established to
be saturated even at the lowest temperature studied, for which the ﬁlm contamination levels are
below the detection limits of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As-deposited ﬁlms are smooth (rms
roughness of 33 A˚ for a 460 A˚ thick ﬁlm deposited on Si at 150/C14 C) and amorphous according to
x-ray diffractometry. However, post-annealing to 600/C14 C in nitrogen leads to the formation of
polycrystalline rutile SnO2. The optical constants obtained from variable angle spectroscopic
ellipsometry suggest that as-deposited ﬁlms have amorphous type bandgaps, which decrease with
increasing temperature and ﬁlm thickness. High quality, amorphous SnO2 ﬁlms with moderately
tunable optical properties are thus obtained by ALD at temperatures as low as 30/C14 C using a
commercially available tin precursor and water.VC 2013 American Vacuum Society.

I. INTRODUCTION
Tin oxide, SnOx,1 /C20 x /C20 2, is a wide bandgap semicon-
ductor material with excellent optical, electrical, and chemical
properties.1–5 As a consequence, SnOx is used in a variety
of applications including gas sensing,6–9 surface coatings
for functional glasses, 10–12 ﬁeld effect transistors, 13,14
catalysis,15–17 and as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) in
photovoltaics and displays.18–22 As part of the solid solution
of indium tin oxide, it produces one of the most commercially
important TCOs.23 In parallel with its large number of appli-
cations, many deposition techniques exist for thin ﬁlms of
SnOx including chemical vapor deposition (CVD),24–28 spray-
pyrolysis,29,30 sputtering,31 and atomic layer deposition
(ALD).28,32–44 ALD is the focus of this study because it has
the potential to enhance the ways SnOx may be integrated
with other materials and to broaden its applications.
For the purpose of growing uniform and conformal thin
ﬁlms, ALD is an increasingly popular method.45–49 This vac-
uum deposition technique is based on alternating gas-surface
reactions separated by inert purges allowing for self-limited
growth, ideally yielding uniform and conformal ﬁlms inde-
pendent of substrate geometry. ALD has been used to deposit
a wide range of materials, including metals,33,47,50–54 metal
oxides,47,53,55–57 and metal sulﬁdes.58–61 It has also allowed for
the area-selective growth of a variety of materials.45–49,62–69
Moreover, conformal coverage ofthree-dimensional substrates
is a characteristic feature resulting from the self-limited growth
mechanism of ALD.9,54,70–74
Starting in the 1990s, ALD was explored as a way to de-
posit SnOx ﬁlms.37,42,43 As with many other ALD systems,
the choice of precursors for depositing SnOx was derived
from related CVD processes.42,43 Depending on growth tem-
perature, some of these ﬁlms had the advantage of being
crystalline as deposited, but yielded corrosive and
equipment-damaging byproducts due to the use of halogen-
ated precursors.33,36,42 Elam and coworkers were the ﬁrst to
publish on the development of a SnO2 ALD process that
used nonhalogenated precursors35 with further developments
by Heo and coworkers.32,38 The former work elucidated the
ALD process using tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn)
and H2O2 and determined an average growth rate of 1.2 A˚/
cycle, a temperature window of 50–200/C14 C and an average
94% transmission of visible light for a ﬁlm thickness of
140 nm. Growth rates of SnO2 using TDMASn and other ox-
idant counter-reactants of ozone and water were also
reported, although these particular ALD processes and the
resultant ﬁlms were not described in detail.
In this work, we build upon these previous results and
further elucidate the ALD of SnOx ﬁlms using the same non-
halogenated precursor, TDMASn, with water as the counter-
reactant. We demonstrate the ability to deposit SnO x at
temperatures as low as 30/C14 C, at growth rates equaling or
exceeding that of ALD with H2O2 as the counter-reactant.
Compared to harsher counter-reactants such as H2O2 and O3,
water can make SnOx ALD more compatible with sensitive
applications in, for instance, biological and polymeric sys-
tems. The use of water may further reduce operating costs
and ease integration into existing processes. Moreover, water
is the counter-reactant of the well-studied ZnO ALD system
based on diethyl zinc.75,76 SnOx ALD with water is thereforea)Electronic mail: sbent@stanford.edu

of potential interest for the development of a thermal zinc tin
oxide (ZTO) ALD process, and as such provides an opportu-
nity for ALD of ZTO with regard to its role as a transparent
conducting oxide.77
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
The ALD experiments were carried out in a custom-built,
viscous-ﬂow, hot-wall reactor shown schematically in Fig.1.
The substrate was loaded into a tube style body (with 35 mm
diameter and /C24 300 mm length) on a stage with temperature
monitoring through an incorporated thermocouple placed
close to the substrate position. Nitrogen carrier gas
(99.999%, Air Products) at 10 sccm was ﬂowed through the
tube, enabling efﬁcient transport of the precursors introduced
at its upstream end. The reactor was evacuated by a rotary
vane pump (Alcatel), resulting in a typical pressure of 100
mTorr during ALD. Precursor pressure pulse amplitudes
were in the range of 1–50 mTorr. Numerical calculations
using the ﬁnite element method based on software from
COMSOL Multiphysics were used to ensure adequate reac-
tor design through modeling of carrier gas ﬂow and diffusion
as described elsewhere.78 A quadrupole mass spectrometer
(SRS RGA200) was used to sample the gas composition
through a needle valve downstream of the ALD substrate.
TDMASn (Strem, >99% purity) was used as a precursor
with deionized water as the counter-reactant. The TDMASn
precursor vial was heated to 45/C14 C and the line used to trans-
port it into the reactor was heated to similar or higher tem-
perature to ensure consistent vapor injections for deposition.
Due to dilution in the carrier gas and effective pumping of
the reactor, precursor condensation on the substrate was
avoided even when the substrate temperature was slightly
below the precursor vial temperature.
Substrates for SnOx ALD included n-type Si(100) with
phosphorous dopant and a resistivity of 1.0–5.0X-cm (WRS
Materials) and microscope slide glass (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Gold Seal, CAT. NO. 2050). All substrates were precleaned
using a Piranha etch (70% H2SO4 and 30% H2O2) to remove
organics and generate a chemical oxide. SnOx thin ﬁlms were
deposited directly onto this chemical oxide. After loading
into the reactor, samples were allowed to outgas for at least
20 min before the reactor was heated to achieve the desired
substrate temperature. After injection of a given precursor for
a certain pulse time, the excess precursor was purged with
nitrogen before the counter-reactant was introduced. The
ALD sequence is compactly expressed as t1:t2:t3:t4, where t1
and t3 correspond to the pulse lengths of TDMASn and water,
respectively, and t2 and t4 to N2 purge times following these
doses. A typical timing sequence was 1:30:2:30 s.
The deposited SnOx ﬁlms were analyzedex-situ by a vari-
ety of methods. A PHI VersaProbe 5000 scanning X-ray pho-
toelectron spectrometer with Al Ka radiation was used to
determine elemental compositions, using the C1s peak at
285.0 eV as a reference. After initial survey scans, adventi-
tious carbon was removed by Arþ sputtering for 12 s (1 keV,
0.5 lA, 1 mm/C2 1m ma t4 5/C14 incidence from the sample). As-
deposited ﬁlms were annealed under ﬂow of N2 (1 cm3/s) in a
Mellen Series SC13R-1300 /C14 C, single zone, split hinged,
round tubular furnace with an Omega 7832 process controller
at 500/C14 C and 600/C14 C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
were taken as a function of anneal temperature using the
FIG. 1. (Color online) Schematic of the custom-built, hot-wall ALD reactor. The main part is a cylindrical tube, heated externally. The tube is ﬁtted withinlets
for N2 carrier gas and precursors close to its upstream end. A sample stage within-situ temperature monitoring is positioned near the center of the tube. A sep-
arately pumped mass spectrometer is used to analyze gas sampled downstream of the stage by means of a needle valve. The calculated carrier gas ﬂow and dif-
fusion through the tube indicate even distribution of the gas. The ﬂow proﬁle in the mid section of the tube is shown.

PANalytical X’Pert PRO system in parallel beam mode with
Cu Ka radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. Film thickness and op-
tical constants of SnOx deposited on Si(100) were determined
using a J.A. Woollam M2000 variable angle spectroscopy el-
lipsometer (VASE). Plan view and cross-sectional images of
SnOx ﬁlm morphology were examined using a FEI Magellan
400 XHR scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a ﬁeld
emission gun source (5 kV and 25 pA). Optical extinction
spectra of ﬁlms deposited on microscope slide glass were
recorded using a Varian Cary 6000i UV-Vis-NIR spectrome-
ter. Topographical information for the ﬁlms was determined
by atomic force microscopy using a Park System atomic
force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. ALD growth characterization
Considering the surface reactions involved in the process
is important for understanding the ﬁlm growth by ALD. A
possible mechanism for the SnO2 ALD using TDMASn and
H2O2 based on in-situ quartz crystal microbalance analysis
was previously suggested. 35 The corresponding reaction
mechanism with water as the counter-reactant is

where DMA represents the dimethylamino ligand, HDMA is
dimethylamine (released to gas phase), the * refers to
surface-bound species, andx is the number of DMA ligands
released during the TDMASn pulse. Measurements indicated
that x /C25 2.5 with H2O as the counter-reactant, compared to a
higher value ofx /C25 3 when using H2O2. They suggest that
this reaction stoichiometry is consistent with the lower
growth rate observed with H2O at higher temperatures and
largely reﬂects a lower degree of surface hydroxylation.35
Reaction (1) shows the importance of the surface hydroxyla-
tion state for the initial adsorption of the precursor.
To determine the conditions for saturated ALD of SnOx in
our studies, the growth rate as a function of TDMASn precur-
sor pulse time (t1) was investigated. Thin ﬁlms of SnOx were
deposited on Si(100) at 150/C14 C for 200 cycles with a timing
sequence of t1:30:2:30 s. The purge times of 30 s were con-
servatively selected to be long enough to purge away excess
reactant, as judged by the downstream gas composition moni-
tored by mass spectroscopy. In this way, contributions from
CVD were minimized. Average ﬁlm thicknesses determined
by VASE were used to calculate the SnOx growth rate.
Figure 2(a) represents the saturation curve for TDMASn and
shows that, within the uncertainty of the experiment, satu-
rated behavior is reached already for the shortest pulse time
of 0.5 s at 150/C14 C. The TDMASn pulse time was ﬁxed to 1 s
to ensure saturation in subsequent experiments. The SnOx
growth as a function of water pulse length (t3) was also inves-
tigated following a similar procedure as before but using a
pulse-purge sequence of 1:30:t3:30 s. Figure2(b) shows that
a relatively steady growth rate is established after 0.5 s H2O
pulse times. These precursor saturation studies suggest that
saturated growth is accomplished for a broad range of pulse
lengths. We obtained growth rates with good reproducibility
for a timing sequence of 1:30:2:30 s at 150/C14 C.
The precise conditions for establishing ALD saturation in
terms of precursor exposure time depend on the particular re-
actor design in addition to the choice of precursor and
counter-reactant. The work of Elam and coworkers using the
tin precursor, TDMASn, and H2O2 to deposit SnOx by ALD
showed a gradual approach toward saturated growth. To
explain this gradual ascent toward saturation, it was pro-
posed that DMA binds strongly to the hydroxylated substrate
resulting in slow desorption, thereby limiting the adsorption
of further TDMASn for pulse times below 2 s. However, this

effect was not observed in our studies in which water was
used as the counter-reactant; for the pulse time intervals
explored, there is little difference between growth rates at
shorter (0.5 s) and longer pulse times (>1.0 s) suggesting
that surface saturation occurred quickly.
Figure 3 presents the SnOx ﬁlm thickness as a function of
number of ALD cycles over the range of 20 to 700 cycles.
The data were collected using VASE for deposition on a
Si(100) substrate at 150 /C14 C with a timing sequence of
1:30:2:30 s. The linear dependence of ﬁlm thickness on cycle
number indicates sustained layer-by-layer growth characteris-
tic of ALD. The average growth rate is 0.70 A˚/cycle, in close
agreement with the previously reported value at this
temperature.35
Figure 4 shows the growth rate of SnOx as a function of
deposition temperature ranging from 30 to 200 /C14 C. The
growth rate displays a clearly decreasing trend with increas-
ing deposition temperature over the entire interval, with a
slight plateau in the range from 150 to 175/C14 C. The growth
rate at 30/C14 Co f/C24 2.1 A˚/cycle is about four times higher than
that at 200/C14 C where it is/C24 0.5 A˚/cycle. This sensitivity to
deposition temperature is much higher than that reported for
the TDMASn and H2O2 ALD system.35 In that system, the
growth rate varied only from /C24 1.6 A˚/cycle at 50 /C14 Ct o
/C24 1.3 A˚/cycle at 200/C14 C, respectively. Also, a region of near
constant growth rate was shown between 100 and 200/C14 C.
On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the use of
water as a counter-reactant results in a higher growth rate at
low temperatures than that previously observed with H2O2.
Comparing with the data presented by Elam and coworkers,
the crossover is around 80/C14 C. So even though the use of
water as a TDMASn counter-reactant is expected to result in
lower concentration of reactive surface hydroxyl groups at
the higher temperatures investigated, the overall SnO x
growth rate is higher at the lower temperatures.
Larger coverages of more loosely bound molecular water
or water-derived species may be available in this temperature
range and capable of contributing to the growth observed.
However, measurement of the growth rates at 30/C14 C pre-
sented in Figs.2(c) and 2(d) shows that the reactions still sat-
urate with the water precursor pulse length. Furthermore, at
this low temperature, growth rate purge time dependence fol-
lowing the 1s TDMASn pulse [Fig.5(a)] and 2 s water pulse
[Fig. 5(b)] shows saturated growth characteristic of ALD.
Taken together, these data imply that the water and water-
derived species present at the surface contribute to the growth
of the SnOx ﬁlm at this low temperature. Thoughin-situ or
theoretical studies may be needed to elucidate the detailed
nature of the water derived species responsible for the high
growth rate in this regime, it is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding that
growth saturation behavior, characteristic of ALD, can be
achieved at 30/C14 C.
B. Film characterization and properties
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed
to determine the ﬁlm composition. Figure6 shows an XPS
survey scan of a 46 nm SnOx ﬁlm deposited at 150/C14 Co n
Si(100) after removal of adventitious surface carbon by Arþ
sputtering. The data show the presence of both Sn and O,
conﬁrming the deposition of an oxide of tin; no carbon or
nitrogen contamination is observed.
Providing a quantitative stoichiometry of the SnOx ﬁlm
from XPS data is difﬁcult. The atomic ratio of Sn:O before
sputtering was close to 1:2, which would suggest a stoichi-
ometry of SnO2. After sputtering the ratio of Sn:O was closer

to 1:1 suggesting a stoichiometry of SnO. However, the pos-
sibility of preferential sputtering of one element over another
leads to uncertainty in the compound stoichiometry. Using
the core level shifts to determine the oxidation state of as-
deposited SnOx using XPS is also challenging due to the
closeness in values of the Sn3d5/2 binding energies for SnO
(486.8 eV) and SnO2 (487.2 eV).
XPS spectra were also obtained for SnOx ﬁlms as a func-
tion of ALD temperature. The data show that nearly carbon-
free ﬁlms can be deposited at all growth temperatures stud-
ied. Carbon levels determined by XPS as a function of depo-
sition temperature are shown in Supporting Information,79
Fig. S1, both before and after Arþ sputtering to remove ad-
ventitious carbon. Although carbon is observed in all ﬁlms
before sputtering, the ﬁlms were solely comprised of Sn and
O after sputtering, independent of deposition temperature.
Importantly, these data indicate that SnOx ALD ﬁlms can be
deposited without signiﬁcant carbon contamination even
near room temperature. In contrast, nitrogen and carbon con-
tamination was observed by Elam and coworkers when using
H2O2 rather than H2O at temperatures below/C24 100 /C14 C.
The SnOx ﬁlms were examined by XRD both as deposited
and after annealing in nitrogen. Figure7 shows the XRD pat-
terns as deposited and after nitrogen annealing to 600/C14 C;
reference diffraction patterns of SnO and SnO2 are included
for comparison. For the as-deposited ﬁlm at 150/C14 C, the ﬁlm
appears to be amorphous. Patterns appear but exhibit broad
peaks upon annealing at 600/C14 C.
The diffraction pattern after annealing is characteristic of
the SnO2 phase, including reﬂection of the (110), (101),
(200), and (211) planes at 26.6/C14 , 33.9/C14 , 37.9/C14 , and 51.8/C14 . The
diffraction peaks in Fig.7 are indexed on the basis of the ru-
tile SnO2 unit cell. Patterns indicative of SnO for reﬂection
of the (101) and (110) planes at 29.9/C14 and 33.3/C14 were not
evident. The large width and low intensities of the peaks
may be the result of small crystallites from incomplete crys-
tallization as well as the relatively low thickness of the ﬁlms
(130 nm). The data strongly suggest that these ﬁlms consist
of rutile SnO2.
The ﬁlm morphology as a function of annealing tempera-
ture in N2 is shown in Fig.8 for a 46 nm thick SnOx sample
deposited at 150/C14 C on Si(100). Figure8(a) indicates that the
as-deposited ﬁlm morphology is relatively smooth with little
variation in features. From AFM (data not shown), the root
mean squared (rms) roughness of the as-deposited ﬁlm was
3.3 nm. Figures8(b) and 8(c) show plan view SEM images
of ﬁlms annealed at 500 and 600 /C14 C, respectively. Upon
annealing, the ﬁlm roughness increases and the crystallite
size increases. The appearance of a more crystalline ﬁlm is
consistent with the diffraction pattern from XRD. The cross-
sectional image in Fig.8(d) of the ﬁlm annealed at 600/C14 C
provides more support for polycrystallinity. The rms rough-
ness of this ﬁlm was 4.5 nm as determined by AFM, which is
larger than for the as-deposited case and consistent with the
growth of larger crystallites.
The optical properties of the SnOx ﬁlms were analyzed
using variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. The ellips-
ometry data were analyzed using a generalized oscillator
model for the SnOx layer. This model included a polynomial
spline function (the psemi-m0 oscillator80) and pole terms in
the infrared and ultraviolet, outside the measured range. The
resulting optical constants are consistent with the
Kramers–Kronig relation by construction.

The resulting refractive indexn and extinction coefﬁcient
k are displayed in Figs.9(a) and 9(b) , respectively, for ﬁlms
deposited on Si(100) using a ﬁxed number of 200 ALD
cycles and varying substrate temperatures (30–200/C14 C). Both
optical constants vary with temperature and display maxi-
mum values for ﬁlms deposited around 150/C14 C. In the litera-
ture, (poly-) crystalline SnO2 is typically ascribed a direct
bandgap in the range of 3.6–4.0 eV.4,81,82 In order to analyze
the optical bandgaps of the SnOx ﬁlms produced here, their
absorption coefﬁcients were determined from a ¼ 4pk/k,
where k is the wavelength of light. However, a direct
bandgap dependence was not clear in a plot of (a h/C23)2 versus
photon energy ( h/C23). Rather, and more characteristic for
amorphous and indirect bandgap semiconductors,83 a plot of
the function (a h/C23)1/2 versus photon energy revealed a linear
segment close to the absorption onset. By extrapolating this
segment to its intersection with the energy axis [see inset of
Fig. 9(b)], the energy gaps of the x-ray amorphous SnOx
ﬁlms were estimated. Figure9(c) shows these energy gaps as
a function of substrate temperature.
The bandgaps of Fig.9(c) reveal a signiﬁcant temperature
dependence, with a minimum occurring around 150 /C14 C.
Because the number of ALD cycles was ﬁxed in this experi-
ment, the varying growth rates (Fig.4) means that the ﬁlm
thickness were higher for the lower temperatures. To investi-
gate if the observed bandgaps and other properties depend
on the ﬁlm thickness, additional experiments at ﬁxed temper-
ature (150/C14 C) and a varying number of ALD cycles were
performed. The results, shown in Fig.9(d), indicate a mono-
tonic decrease of bandgap with thickness, from 4.4 eV for
the thinnest (approximately 2 nm) ﬁlm down to 2.7 eV for
the thickest (20 nm) ﬁlm. The ﬁlm thickness dependence
may therefore possibly explain the increasing trend at the
highest temperatures of Fig.9(c). Although the underlying
mechanism for this thickness dependence is not yet known,
we speculate that the ﬁlms, rather than being purely amor-
phous, may form a ﬁne-grained microstructure undetectable
to XRD and with feature sizes related to the ﬁlm thickness.84
If the grains conﬁne the wave functions of excited states, the
bandgap will be affected by their size, with smaller grains
exhibiting larger bandgaps. Since the exciton Bohr radius of
SnO2 quantum dots has been estimated to 2.7 nm,26 it seems
feasible that effects related to quantum conﬁnement could be
observed for the range of thicknesses covered here. Similar
reasoning could be used to explain the increasing bandgap at
lower temperatures, where growth conditions rather than
ﬁlm thickness would favor smaller grain sizes and therefore
higher bandgap.84 The minimum bandgap at 150/C14 Cm a y
then plausibly be the result of a maximum grain size, for the
particular situation after 200 ALD cycles. Further characteri-
zation, for instance by transmission electron microscopy,
would be needed to clarify this sensitive dependence of the
optical properties on ﬁlm thickness and substrate tempera-
ture in SnOx thin ﬁlms. In this context, it is also noteworthy
that the growth rate increases by more than a factor 2 as the
substrate temperature is reduced from 100 to 30/C14 C (Fig.4).
One may suspect that a lower mobility of surface species at
low temperature would lead to a more porous ﬁlm, and per-
haps a concomitant higher growth rate. However, as the re-
fractive indices are essentially the same over the whole
spectrum in this temperature interval [Fig.9(a)], ﬁlm poros-
ity is unlikely to account for increased growth rate, and an
explanation based on the surface coverage of hydroxyl
groups, outlined above, appears more plausible.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
By exploring in detail the use of water as a counter-
reactant, this work expands on the application of TDMASn
for the deposition of high quality tin oxide ﬁlms in a low
temperature range of 30–200/C14 C. Spectroscopic analyses
show no appreciable change in elemental composition as a
function of deposition temperature. Morphological and topo-
graphical analyses show that as-deposited SnOx ﬁlm is

ﬁcient extracted from spectroscopic ellipsometry, as a function of the sub-
strate temperature for ﬁlms deposited using 200 ALD cycles. The inset in
(b) illustrates plots of (a h/C23)1/2 with linear ﬁts (dashed lines) to the approxi-
mately linear portion of the curve. Bandgaps are estimated from the intersec-
tion of the linear ﬁts with (a h/C23)1/2 ¼0. (c) Estimated bandgaps as a function
of temperature, after 200 cycles of ALD. (d) Bandgaps as a function of ﬁlm
thickness for varying number of ALD cycles and a substrate temperature
ﬁxed to 150/C14 C. The dashed lines in (c) and (d) represent quadratic ﬁts to the
data.

relatively smooth, with only small crystalline features. XRD
measurements before and after annealing in inert atmosphere
show that the deposited ﬁlms consist of x-ray amorphous
SnO2 which transform to rutile SnO2 after annealing. The
optical properties of the ﬁlms display an interesting depend-
ence on both deposition temperature and ﬁlm thickness.
Thin ﬁlms grown at low temperature (30/C14 C) have relatively
high bandgaps in excess of 4.0 eV, while thicker ﬁlms grown
at 150/C14 C have bandgaps below 3 eV. Thus, SnOx ﬁlms of
high purity may to some extent be grown with tailored prop-
erties using this ALD process. This scheme for SnOx ALD
can allow for electrically and optically useful ﬁlms, such as
for transparent conductors and solar cell buffer layers, to be
produced from earth abundant and inexpensive raw materi-
als. The ability to grow this important metal oxide at near
room temperature may further be favorable for biological
applications and in industrial processes where reduced ther-
mal demands are desired.
