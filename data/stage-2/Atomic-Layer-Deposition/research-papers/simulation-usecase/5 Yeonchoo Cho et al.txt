 Modulation of the adsorption chemistry of a precursor in 
atomic layer deposition to enhance the growth per cycle 
of a TiO 2  thin film 
 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has scarcely been utilized in 
industrial processes due to its low productivity, even though 
it possesses several advantages for improving device 
performance. In this study, we investigate the exact 
chemical reaction mechanism of the ALD to obtain a 
designated growth behaviour or property, theoretically and 
experimentally. This study provides significant implications 
for understanding the ALD reaction mechanism based on

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has scarcely been utilized in large-scale manufacturing and industrial
processes due to its low productivity, even though it possesses several advantages for improving
the device performance. The major cause of its low productivity is the slow growth rate, which is
determined by the amount of chemisorbed precursor. The slow growth rate of ALD has become even
more critical due to the introduction of heteroleptic-based precursors for achieving a higher thermal
stability. In this study, we investigated the theoretical and experimental chemisorption characteristics of
the Ti(CpMe5)(OMe)3 precursor during the ALD of TiO 2. By density functional theory calculations, the
relationship between the steric hindrance eﬀect and the chemistry of a chemisorbed precursor was
revealed. Based on the calculation result, a way for improving the growth per cycle by 50% was
proposed and demonstrated, successfully.
Introduction
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been attracting a lot of
attention as the most promising thin film deposition technique
owing to its superior characteristics, such as precisely control-
lable film thickness and composition, excellent uniformity
and step coverage, and good adhesion. 1–6 Moreover, ALD
has been employed in the deposition of various kinds of thin
film materials, such as conventional metals7–9 and metal
oxides,10–14 and emerging materials such as perovskites 15–19
and 2-dimensional materials. 20–25 Hence, ALD is useful not
only in electronic device applications, 26–28 but also in passiva-
tion layer coating 29,30 and functional thin film coating. 31
However, the applicability of ALD is hindered in the industry
because of its low growth rate during the fabrication process.
This implies that the application of ALD can be dramatically
improved by solving the low growth rate problem.
The growth rate of ALD is generally calculated by the
deposited film thickness per cycle (growth per cycle (GPC)).
GPC is aﬀected by several process parameters, among which
the amount of chemisorbed precursor ( pchem) is the most
significant.32,33 The pchem value strongly depends on the sur-
face chemistry. The chemistry of surface termination charac-
terizes the density of the active site, where the precursor can be
adsorbed chemically; further, the geometry of the precursor
ligand limits the maximum density ofpchem, which is a result of
steric hindrance. Generally, the number of activated sites on
the substrate can be increased by introducing a surfactant.
Several surfactants (generally based on carbon compounds)
have been introduced for performing surface treatment to
enhance the chemisorption of a precursor that increases the
GPC successfully. However, the residual compound from the
surfactant causes contamination, resulting in severe degrada-
tion of the electrical properties.34 The maximum density
of pchem, which is governed by steric hindrance, limits the
enhancement of pchem upon increasing the adsorption site
number when the surfactant is incorporated. Moreover, bigger
ligands have been introduced recently in numerous metal–
organic precursors for ALD,35 thereby enhancing the influence
of steric hindrance on the GPC. In this regard, the reduction in
steric hindrance would effectively increase the GPC. The steric
hindrance is influenced by the ligand geometry of the chemi-
sorbed precursor; therefore, analysing the reaction that occurs
between the surface termination group and the precursor
is also important. However, only a few studies have elucidated
the chemical reaction mechanism that occurs during the
chemisorption of a precursor, thereby demonstrating a change
in GPC due to steric hindrance.

In this work, the GPC of TiO 2 ALD is enhanced by control-
ling the pchem of Ti according to the surface termination
chemistry. Furthermore, the mechanism involved in the GPC
enhancement is revealed by investigating the chemical reaction
between the surface termination and the precursor. The steric
hindrance ofpchem has also been experimentally and theoreti-
cally estimated.
Experimental
We performed first-principles density-functional simulations
and used Gaussian 16 for molecular simulations.36 [Gaussian 16,
Revision A.03] The B3LYP functional was used with a cc-pVTZ
basis set and D3 dispersion correction.37 For slab simulations, we
used the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. 38 The Perdew–
Burke–Ernzerhof functional was used with D3 dispersion
correction.37 The plane wave cut-off was 400 eV. The atomic
structures were relaxed until the residual forces decreased to a
v a l u el e s s e rt h a n0 . 0 2e VA/C01. We prepared a rutile TiO 2(110) slab
as described by Zydor et al.39 I nt h ep r e s e n c eo fc h e m i s o r b e d
water, the Ti precursor underwent chemisorption. Due to the
steric hindrance between the precursor and the surface, the
cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand and the methoxy ligands were more
stable when they were parallel to the [/C0110] direction, compared
to the [001] direction.
TiO2 thin films were deposited in a shower-head type ALD
reactor (iSAC research, iOV dX1) to obtain a single wafer of 6 in.
diameter. Ti(CpMe5)(OMe)3 (synthesized by SK Trichem Co.,
Ltd, Korea) was employed as the Ti precursor, respectively. The
canister of Ti(CpMe5)(OMe)3 was heated to 80 1C for obtaining
an appropriate precursor vapor pressure. O 3 was the source of
oxygen in TiO 2 ALD with a concentration of 200 g m /C03. For all
the experiments, the thin film growth temperature ( Tg) was
370 1C. All the TiO 2 thin films were deposited on a Ru (40 nm)/
SiO2 (100 nm)/Si substrate with the sequence consisting of
Ti(CpMe5)(OMe)3 feeding, Ar purge, O 3 feeding, and Ar purge
steps of 12, 15, 10, and 15 s, respectively. To measure the
electrical properties, a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitor
was fabricated with a 30 nm thick RuO2 top electrode (TE) using
a metal shadow mask (with a 300 mm hole diameter). On
the RuO 2 TE, an additional 50 nm thick Pt layer was deposited
to improve the contact while probing. The RuO 2 TE layer
was deposited by DC reactive sputtering using an Ru metal
target under an Ar/O2 atmosphere. After the TE deposition,
post-metallization annealing (PMA) was performed at 400 1C
for 30 m under 95% N 2 +5 %O 2 atmosphere inside a tube
furnace. The film thickness was measured using spectroscopic
ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam, ESM-300), X-ray fluorescence
spectroscopy (XRF, Thermo Scientific ARL QUANT’X), and
X-ray reflection spectroscopy (XRR, PANalytical X’Pert Pro). The
chemical structure was analysed using X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS, Sigma Probe). Glancing angle incident X-ray
diffraction (GIXRD, PANalytical X’Pert Pro., incident angle of
0.51) was used to examine the crystallographic structure of the
deposited films. The electrical performance was studied by
measuring the capacitance/C0voltage (C/C0V) and the current/C0voltage
(I/C0V) using Hewlett Packard 4140B and 4194A, respectively.
During the electrical tests, the TE was biased and the bottom
electrode (BE) was grounded.
Results and discussion
The chemisorption behaviour of the Ti precursor was analysed,
depending on the surface termination chemistry. The Ti pre-
cursor adsorption was a typical dissociative chemisorption. The
OCH3 ligand captured the surface hydrogen, which was
released as a methanol molecule. The Ti precursor was strongly
bound to the surfacevia the Ti–O bond. This interaction could
be considered as a ligand exchange reaction from the frame of
reference of the Ti precursor. The reaction was exothermic with
a reaction energy of/C01.25 eV. The CpMe 5 (Cp*) and OCH 3
ligands laid parallel to the [ /C0110] direction. If they lie perpendi-
cular to this direction, the stability decreases because of the
steric hindrance between the Cp* ligand and the surface
oxygen. Consequently, the TiO2 ALD with the Ti precursor has
a low GPC because the Ti precursor chemisorbs with the Cp*
ligand and two OCH3 ligands, thereby inducing severe steric
hindrance. Hence, the GPC can be increased by altering the
ligand chemistry of the chemisorbed Ti precursor. However,
despite the induction of steric hindrance by the Cp* ligand, the
Cp* ligand cannot be removed during the chemisorption
because it improves the temperature stability of the precursor.
Hence, we considered eliminating the OCH3 ligand to reduce
the steric hindrance.
To eliminate the OCH 3 ligand, H 2O was chosen for altering
OCH3 into OH, which exhibited a smaller size; this is because
H2O does not react with the Cp* ligand under moderate ALD
process conditions. 40 Moreover, introducing H 2O in ALD is
convenient due to the physisorption of H 2O, thereby rendering
H2O suitable for reducing the steric hindrance. The physi-
sorbed water molecules have suﬃcient energy to react with
the Ti precursors and reduce the steric hindrance in the Ti
precursor pulse. Fig. 1 shows two ways in which the Ti pre-
cursor reacts with a water molecule. In the reactant state, one of
the hydrogen atoms in the water molecule is hydrogen-bonded
to the methoxy oxygen in the Ti precursor. This hydrogen atom
can be transferred to the Ti precursor if a relatively small
activation energy of 0.39 eV is applied. As a result, a methanol
molecule is released and the Ti precursor becomes less bulky.
There is also a possibility in which the hydrogen atom can be
transferred to the Cp* ligand; however, this process requires
more energy. In addition, the hydrogen in the initial reactant
state prefers to interact with the oxygen in the methoxy ligand,
rather than the carbon in the Cp* ligand. Thus, the release of
methanol is preferred, as observed experimentally. However,
the activation energy required for the Cp* detachment is not
excessively large. At elevated temperatures, a chemical vapor
deposition (CVD)-like non-self-limiting behaviour is expected.
Note that the energies represented in Fig. 1 are internal
energies. Although the internal energy of the product state is

higher than that of the reactant state, the reaction can be driven
by entropy. It is also important to note that although the B3LYP
hybrid exchange–correlation functional is used in the calcula-
tions for accuracy, it underestimates the activation energies.
Hence, the actual activation energies are likely larger.
The hydroxyl ligand significantly reduced the steric hindrance
compared to the methoxy ligand. First-principles atomistic scale
simulations were used to estimate the diﬀerence in the amount of
chemisorbed precursor (Fig. 2). In the presence of methoxy
ligands, one out of every three adsorption sites was blocked owing
to the steric hindrance in the [/C0110] direction (Fig. 2(a)). Both the
Cp* and methoxy ligands are sourc es of significant steric hin-
drance. Although the precursors can occupy two adsorption sites
in a row in the [ /C0110] direction, the steric hindrance tilts them in
the opposite directions (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). Hence, the precursor
cannot be adsorbed to the nearest adsorption sites next to the
precursor pair. If the methoxy ligands are replaced with hydroxyl
ligands, the steric hindrance is significantly decreased. The
precursor with the hydroxyl ligands can occupy every adsorp-
tion site along the [ /C0110] direction (Fig. 2(c)). In the [001]
direction, the precursor occupies three adsorption sites regard-
less of whether it has methoxy ligands or hydroxyl ligands. As
shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the chemisorbed precursor density is
1.15 nm/C02, while as shown in Fig. 2(c) it is 1.72 nm /C02. A simple
change of ligands from methoxy to hydroxyl can enhance the
chemisorbed precursor density by 50%.
The change in the GPC of TiO 2 ALD with respect to the
sequence has been investigated to confirm the experimental
implementation of the theoretically calculated increase in the
GPC, through H2O. In this study, the Ti precursor employed in
the TiO 2 ALD reacts only with O 3. Even at a higher temperature
of 390 1C, the Ti precursor does not react with H 2O (data not
shown). This result might have originated from the reactivity
diﬀerence between O3 and H 2O. The GPC of TiO 2 ALD with O 3
was 0.034 nm per cycle. This GPC value is in agreement with the
previous results of TiO 2 ALD with a heteroleptic Ti precursor. 35
This is because of the steric hindrance originating from the
bulky geometry of the Cp* ligand. The GPC in ALD is aﬀected by
the amount of chemisorbed precursor during the precursor
pulse step. Also, the steric hindrance by the geometry of the
ligand, where the precursor adsorbs chemically on the surface,
is one of the most considerable factors for determining the
GPC. Additionally, the Cp-based Ti precursor induces a certain
GPC value in the TiO 2 ALD. The geometry of the ligand in the
precursor generally changes during chemisorption because
chemisorption involves a chemical reaction. Hence, the surface
termination chemistry strongly aﬀects the nature of chemi-
sorption of the precursor, resulting in significant changes in
the deposition behaviour.40 Both O 3 and H 2O are the most
widely used oxygen sources in ALD, but they induce diﬀerent
surface termination. Therefore, modified TiO2 ALD sequence
by employing additional H 2O feeding and purge steps right
after the O 3 feeding and purge steps (Fig. 3(a)) was used to
investigate the change in the growth behaviour with respect to
t h ea l t e r e ds u r f a c et e r m i n a t i o nchemistry. The GPC value change

was evaluated. The additional H 2O step increased the GPC
dramatically. The GPC of 0.034 nm per cycle in the conven-
tional ALD sequence which consisted of the Ti precursor
feeding and purge, also the O 3 feeding and purge steps,
increased gradually with the increasing step time of the addi-
tionally introduced H2O feeding time (10 s), and reached
0.052 nm per cycle, a value of approximately 1.53 times higher
than the conventional sequence. Moreover, the GPC change by
the additional H2O step exhibited some characteristic beha-
viours with respect to the purge step time. The significant
increase in GPC decreased when the H 2O purge time increased.
In the case of an H 2O feeding time of 3 s, the GPC decreased to
the same level as without the H 2O feeding where the purge time
was increased up to 30 s. This H 2O purge time, where the GPC
reached a conventional sequence level, was gradually increased
to 60 and 120 s in the case of a H2O feeding time of 5 and 10 s,
respectively. The characteristic behaviour in the GPC caused by
the additional H2O step is summarized as follows: the addi-
tionally introduced H 2O contributes to increasing the GPC, the
increasing GPC saturates with respect to the H 2O feeding time,
and the GPC increasing eﬀect disappeared with the increasing
purge time. Furthermore, the increased GPC caused by the
additional H2O step was retained up to hundreds of ALD cycles
(Fig. 3(d)), which indicates that the GPC enhancement is
observed not only on the Ru substrate, but also on the fully
covered surface deposited with the TiO2 film.
These characteristic behaviours indicate that the introduced
H2O was adsorbed on the surface physically; this physisorbed
H2O contributed to the increase in GPC. Moreover, since the
increase in GPC eventually saturated and H 2O did not react
with the chemisorbed Ti precursor, the increase in pchem of the
Ti precursor can be attributed to H 2O changing the steric
hindrance. These behaviours, especially the increment of GPC
byB50%, are consistent with the density functional theory
(DFT) calculations.
Furthermore, the properties of the TiO 2 thin films deposited
by the conventional and H 2O-added sequences were investi-
gated to detect any degradation caused by the H 2O-added
sequence. The chemical structures of the films were explored
using XPS analysis. Fig. 4(a) and (c) shows the Ti 2p XPS spectra
(data points) of the TiO 2 thin films deposited by the conven-
tional without the H 2O sequence and with the H 2O-added
sequence methods, respectively. Also, the deconvoluted spectra
(lines) were obtained assuming that the Ti 2p peaks were
composed of the Ti 2p3/2 peak centred at 458.0 and the Ru
3p3/2 peak centred at 460.2 eV, which correspond to TiO 2 and
metallic Ru, respectively. 41 The XPS spectra of both the samples
were almost identical regardless of the H 2O sequence. More-
over, the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4(b) and (d)) also comprised the
same oxygen components that were present in TiO2 and
absorbed on the surface.
The chemistry of the TiO 2 ALD also aﬀects the crystallinity of
the TiO2 thin film deposited on the Ru substrate. In the case of
the TiO 2 ALD on the Ru electrode, which utilizes O 3 as the
oxygen source, the Ru substrate is oxidized by O 3 in an in situ
manner;41–43 the resulting B1 nm thick RuO 2 induces phase
transition of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile via the local epitaxial
relationship. Consequently, any change in the chemistry during
the TiO2 ALD on the Ru substrate alters the crystallinity of the
TiO2 thin film. Fig. 5 shows the GIXRD pattern of the samples
comprising a 20 nm thick TiO 2 thin film deposited on the Ru

substrate under varying H 2O feeding time periods. All the as-
deposited films were crystallized without any post-deposition
annealing. The diffraction pattern of the TiO2 thin film without
the H 2O sequence indicated that the thin film comprised
crystalline TiO 2 with a rutile structure. With the increasing
H2O feeding time, no significant change was observed in the
diffraction peak of rutile TiO 2 at 2 y = 27.3 1, even for an H 2O
feeding time of 10 s. The results obtained from the XPS and
XRD analyses indicate that the physisorbed H 2O does not
induce any change in the chemical reaction between the
chemisorbed Ti precursor and O3 by exhibiting no significant
change in the chemical and physical structure of the TiO 2
thin film.
The electrical properties of the MIM capacitor employing a
20 nm thick TiO 2 thin film as an insulating layer also indicated
the presence of identical physical and chemical structures,
especially the crystallinity of the TiO 2 thin film deposited with
the additional H 2O feeding step as compared to that of the film
deposited via the conventional sequence. The bulk dielectric
constant ( k) was estimated from the inverse slope of the
physical thickness ( tphy) vs. equivalent oxide thickness ( tox) plot,
where tox = tphy(3.9/k), because k represents the crystallinity of
the TiO2 thin film. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the k values of the TiO 2
thin films by conventional and H 2O-added sequences were
93.5 and 97.8, respectively. This result indicates that the TiO 2
thin films have identical crystallinity with the rutile phase.
Moreover, the y-intercepts of the film by conventional and H 2O-
added sequences were also identical to the values of 0.067 and
0.078 nm, respectively. The y-axis intercept in tox vs. tphy plot is
determined by the interfacial properties between the TiO 2 film
and the TE or the BE, implying that the additional H 2O step
does not induce any change at the interface of the TE or the BE.
Hence, the leakage current densityvs. applied voltage ( J–V)
curve of the MIM structure, which comprised the TiO 2 thin film
deposited by the H 2O-added sequence, was identical to that of
the film deposited via the conventional sequence (Fig. 6(b)). In
the J–V curve of the MIM comprising TiO 2 deposited via the
conventional sequence, the J value is significantly higher in the
positive applied voltage region than in the negative region. This
is due to the relatively defective interfacial properties between
Ru BE and the TiO2 thin film, which is caused by the damage to
Ru BE due to O 3 during the deposition. The asymmetric J–V
curve of the H 2O-added sequence also demonstrated identical
characteristics. Fig. 6(c) shows the summary of the electrical
performances of both (conventional and H2O-added sequence)
the films, which shows the variation of J estimated at +0.8 V
as a function of tox. Since these two types of TiO 2 thin films
have the exact same physical and chemical properties, all the
points from the two TiO2 thin films lie on the same trend in the
J–tox curve.
Conclusions
A theoretical and experimental approach to ALD has been
proposed based on DFT to significantly improve the GPC of
TiO2 ALD, which is considered to be the most limiting char-
acteristic of ALD. The calculation of the chemisorption reaction
of Ti(CpMe5)(OMe)3 in the TiO 2 ALD, which has a low GPC due
to its bulky ligand structure, revealed that the OCH 3 group also
participates in inducing severe steric hindrance. The OCH 3
ligand can be changed to a smaller ligand of OH using H 2O.
Eventually, pchem increases by 50% due to the reaction of H 2O
and OCH 3. The GPC of TiO 2 ALD increased by 53% when H 2O
is introduced via an added sequence, which is consistent
with the increase in GPC calculated by DFT. Moreover, the
increase in GPC eventually saturated as indicated by the DFT
calculation, thereby successfully completing the objective of
the study.
