Abstract: The initial surface reactions involved in the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO 2 from TiI 4 and
H 2 O onto a SiO 2 substrate have been investigated using electronic structure calculations based on cluster
models. The detailed atomic growth mechanisms on different types of functionalities on the SiO 2 substrate
have been proposed. The effects of quantum tunneling and hindered rotations of adsorbates on the rate
of surface reactions have been investigated. The effects of tunneling were found to be negligible for all
reactions, because typical ALD temperatures range from 150 to 450° C. However, the rotational contributions
to the rate constants must be taken into account in certain cases. All of the three surface functionalities
investigated exhibit high chemical reactivity toward TiI4 precursors at typical ALD temperatures. The rate
constants of the second half-reactions between Ti intermediates and H 2 O are 5 -8 orders of magnitude
smaller than the first half-reactions between TiI 4 and the surface functionalities. Although the iodine release
reaction has been used to explain previous experimental measurements, it is predicted to be unfavorable
(kinetically and thermodynamically) and is unlikely to occur at typical ALD temperatures. Substitution of
TiI4 with TiCl 4 as the metal precursor can increase the binding energies of the absorbates onto the surface
due to the high electronegativity of the Cl ligands. However, the activation barriers are not significantly
different between these two metal precursors. More importantly, our calculations predict that TiI 4 precursors
tend to produce TiO 2 films with fewer impurities than the TiCl 4 precursors.
1. Introduction
The continuous scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor field
effect transistors (MOSFETs) reduces the SiO 2 layer thickness
to the limit where leakage current, due to a quantum mechanical
tunneling mechanism, becomes a critical problem. Therefore,
it is necessary to develop high- gate dielectric replacement
materials for SiO 2 and improve deposition techniques. Among
the possible fabrication technologies, atomic layer deposition
(ALD) is an ideal candidate. ALD is a deposition method by
which precursor vapors are alternately pulsed onto the surface
of a substrate, with a purge cycle of an inert gas between the
precursor pulses. The surface reactions in ALD are comple-
mentary and self-limiting, which enables the deposition of a
material through highly uniform and conformal growth, with
thickness control at the atomic level.1
Since its original development for the fabrication of thin film
electroluminescent (TFEL) display devices, the applications of
ALD have been explored extensively by researchers around the
world and has found uses in nanotechnology,2 catalysts, 3
electronic and optoelectronic materials, 4 and semiconductor
devices. 5 Rapidly increasing interest toward ALD has originated
from the electronic materials industry as desired film thicknesses
are shrinking. Valuable film properties, such as excellent
conformality, uniformity, and controllability, obtained using this
technique are now beginning to outweigh the inherent drawback
of low deposition rates. For instance, Kim and Yun6 have begun
experimenting with nanolaminated thin films, synthesized by
using alternating precursors during the ALD process. These
atomically detailed films have been shown to possess superior
characteristics for high- gate-oxide materials, which are
commonly used in MOSFETs. There is a huge market potential
for the application of ALD processing to microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS), due to the precision attainable with this
technique. In contrast to the other techniques tested, ALD allows
highly conformal coatings to be deposited on high aspect ratio
structures, which are typical of MEMS devices.7 These initial
discoveries, along with other applications of ALD, motivate the
need to develop mechanistic models and simulation tools, which
can provide fundamental insight into this surface deposition
process.
In this work, we focus on the initial surface reactions of TiO 2

H 2 O precursors has been examined in our previous work. 8 Here,
we investigated the initial surface reactions in the TiI 4 /H 2 O ALD
process because the smaller strength of the Ti -I bond compared
to the Ti -Cl bond provides a nice comparison with regards to
the thermodynamics and kinetics of the two precursors. Other
computational studies have reported the energetics and reaction
mechanisms of related ALD process, such as ALD of Al2 O 3 ,9
ZrO 2 ,10 and metal-nitride. 11 However, this is the first report that
we are aware of regarding the TiI 4 /H 2 O system.
The actual ALD growth mechanism is complicated by
competing reactions, significant structural relaxation, and den-
sification processes, as surface coverage increases and subse-
quent layers are deposited.12,13 Unfortunately, due to the high
computational cost, it is not practical to model all of the features
of the ALD growth cycle using electronic structure calculations.
In this work, we focus only on the initial surface reaction
mechanisms that initialize the ALD growth of TiO2 on different
reactive sites of SiO 2 surfaces in the zero coverage limit. We
present detailed chemical mechanism and kinetic data, which
can be used to understand experimental results and optimize
operating conditions. In addition, this information can be
incorporated into larger-scale simulations, such as kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations, allowing one to model more complex surface
dynamics and extended structures.
2. Computational Details
In ideal ALD conditions, the gas-phase reactions are eliminated by
alternate exposure of the precursors (separated by purging) restricting
the reactions to the number of surface sites available. Because different
surface sites may have different reaction rates or even different reaction
mechanisms with the same precursor, a critical question in surface
kinetics is whether the surface sites are distinguishable. For the case
of hydroxylated SiO2 surfaces, several types of surface functionalities
have been experimentally detected. 14 -16 In this work, we examined the
reaction kinetics on three typical types of surface functional groups on
the SiO2 substrate (isolated -OH groups, adjacent hydrogen-bonded
-OH groups, and oxygen bridges). Because of the high computational
cost of electronic structure calculations, small cluster models (Figure
1) were used to represent the three different active sites on the SiO2
substrate. These models have been used in previous work to study ALD
of TiO2 from TiCl 4 and H 2 O and were shown to give results consistent
with larger models. 8 In addition, we also investigated cluster size effects
by using a larger Si 12 O 14 H 24 cluster model (Figure S1; Supporting
Information), and we found that the smaller cluster models used here
are reliable for studying the reactions examined in this paper (discussed
in Supporting Information). The clusters are generated by truncating
the local structures from the extended surface and terminating with
hydrogen atoms, which helps avoid unphysical electronic effects due
to the cleaved O-Si bonds. Due to the amorphous structure of the
interfacial SiO 2 in MOSFETs, boundary constraints were not applied
to the clusters by freezing boundary atoms to specific spatial positions
or directions. Therefore, in our calculations, the clusters were fully
relaxed. This may potentially lead to over-relaxation of the cluster
model. However, due to the flexible relaxation of amorphous SiO 2
structures and the low-energy cost of the stretching and bending of the
soft Si-O -Si bond angle, the mechanical constraints imposed on the
cluster by the extended surface is predicted to be small. In addition,
surface adsorption and reactions have little effect on the bonding among
the atoms of the substrate due to the localized states of covalent bonds,
so any induced relaxation of the substrate should be small. Therefore,
although the fully relaxed cluster may underestimate the strain of the
surrounding surface, the relative energies of critical structures along
the reaction coordinates should be predicted accurately.
The potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the reacting systems were
constructed by electronic structure calculations using Gaussian03. 17 The
equilibrium structures and transition structures along the reaction
pathways were computed using gradient-corrected density functional
theory with the Becke three-parameter exchange functional18 and the
Lee -Yang -Parr correlation functional 19 (B3LYP). This approach has
been successfully applied to studies of ALD growth mechanisms 9,11,20
and to transition metals. 21 The optimized geometries were predicted
using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set on Si, O, H, and Ti atoms, whereas the
I atoms were expanded using an augmented LANL2DZ relativistic
effective core potential (RECP) basis set. The LANL2DZ basis set
consist of a LANL RECP and a double-œ valence basis set. 22 To further
improve the quality of the basis set, the LANL2DZ was augmented by
single sets of d polarization and p diffuse functions with optimized
exponents of 0.306 and 0.0304, respectively.23 For consistency with
previous studies, 23 this augmented basis set is denoted as LANL2DZdp.
The addition of the polarization and diffuse functions improves the
valence basis set and makes the LANL2DZdp comparable to the all-
electron 6-31+G(d) basis set in computational accuracy. 23 The com-
bined basis set used in geometry optimizations (6-31G(d,p) on Si, O,
H, and Ti and LANL2DZdp on I) is termed BSI. The nature of the
stationary points on the PES was identified by subsequent frequency
calculations, which also yielded zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections.
Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed to

examine the reaction path leading down from a transition structure in
both directions on the PES to ensure that the transition states connect
reactants to products.
In previous work, 8 it was found that adsorption energies calculated
using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set are usually overestimated due to basis
set superposition error (BSSE). To reduce the BSSE to a negligible
level and improve the description of bonding for the adsorbed complex
and the transition state structures, a triple-œ basis set with multiple
polarization functions and diffuse functions should be used, especially
for the Ti and O atoms. Also, it was found that an accurate single point
energy calculation using a large basis set at a geometry computed at a
smaller basis set gives results comparable to performing all calculations
at the larger basis set. Therefore, in this work, single point energy
calculations were carried out using the 6-311++G(2df,2p) basis set
on the Si, O, H, and Ti atoms and the LANL2DZdp basis set on the I
atoms. This combined basis set is termed BSII. A few preliminary
calculations were carried out to determine the performance of the
different theory levels on the energy prediction. On the basis of these
results, which are discussed in Section 3.1 in detail, second-order
Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is used to calculate the heat
of adsorption and the activation barrier, and DFT with the B3LYP
functional is used to calculate the heat of reaction. This computation
scheme is chosen as an optimal tradeoff between accuracy and
computational cost. The detailed methods used to calculate the 0 K
heat of adsorption, the activation barrier, and the 0 K enthalpy of
reaction reported in this paper are described in the Supporting
Information.
The rate constants of the elementary surface reactions are computed
using harmonic semiclassical transition state theory (SC -TST) as
developed by Fermann and Auerbach: 24
where k TST is the conventional transitional state theory rate constant
and ¡( T )is the tunneling correction factor, given by
where k B is Boltzmann’s constant, h is Plank’s constant, T is
temperature, q q is the partition function of the activated complex, q r is
the partition function of the reactant(s), ¢E 0 is ZPE-including classical
activation barrier, öq is the imaginary frequency of the activated
complex corresponding to the vibrational mode in the reaction
coordinate, andı is the barrier penetration integral for the reaction
coordinate. The parameters required by SC -TST are obtained from
the electronic structure calculations described above. The energy barriers
are calculated at MP2/BSII//B3LYP/BSI approximation with B3LYP/
BSI ZPE correction. The partition functions are computed using
standard statistical thermodynamics methods, and the B3LYP/BSI
frequencies are used to calculate the contributions to the partition
functions from vibrational motions.
On the basis of Hernandez and Miller’s SC -TST, 25 which include
the effects of reaction path curvature and barrier anharmonicity and
require a detailed description of the PES to parametrize their model,
the Fermann and Auerbach approach requires only the energies and
frequencies at the reactant state and the transition states. It is much
less computationally demanding than the sophisticated multidimensional
theories that require detailed descriptions of the minimum energy path
(MEP) or cubic and quartic derivatives of the potential energy, which
is prohibitively expensive to obtain from electronic calculations for
the reaction systems being studied. The SC -TST developed by
Fermann and Auerbach features a truncated parabolic barrier by
reintroducing the ground state energy of the reactant. By setting a
maximum barrier penetration integral (ı0 ) ð¢E 0 /h jöqj), the numerical
instabilities and convergence problems in SC -TST were eliminated.
It has been shown that ¡( T ) is well-behaved at all temperatures and,
hence, provides an approach to predict quantum rate coefficients with
qualitative reliability.24 In addition, following the method proposed by
Fermann and Auerbach, 24 we also calculated the tunneling crossover
temperature (T x ) by:
The crossover temperature enables us to quickly identify the temperature
regime (temperatures below T x ) where the tunneling is significant.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Model Chemistry. To find a reliable theoretical model
for predicting the energetics of the reaction systems, we
performed some test calculations on the (SiH3 O) 3 Si -OH*
(surface species are denoted by asterisks) + TiCl 4 reaction,
which has been studied in detail in previous work. 8 Different
model chemistries, including high-level CCSD(T), are used in
total energy calculations using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) geometries
and ZPE corrections. Because a high level model chemistry is
not computationally practical for the system being studied here,
a hybrid ONIOM method26 was used in these test calculations.
The ONIOM procedure divides the real system into two or three
model systems, which are treated with different model chem-
istries. The total ONIOM energy of a two-level system is defined
as:
The ONIOM model used in our calculations is shown in Figure
2. As shown, the substrate atoms (represented as spheres) and
the TiCl4 precursor are the crucial region for the energetics of
the reactions and, hence, are treated with high-level model
chemistries: B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p), MP2/6-311 ++G(2df,-
2p), or CCSD(T)/6-311 ++G(2df,2p). The remaining atoms are
approximated at the less-expensive HF/6-31G(d,p) level. Note
that the ONIOM methods are only used in the test calculations,
which identify reliable theoretical models used in the energy
predictions for the reactions in the following sections.
We use the following abbreviations to identify the compound
ONIOM model chemistries tested here.

The energetics calculated using the three different ONIOM
model chemistries for the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiCl 4 f
(SiH 3 O) 3 Si -O -TiCl 3 * + HCl reaction are listed in Table 1, and
we assume ONIOM(CCSD(T)) gives us the most accurate
predictions, which are used to evaluate the other two model
chemistries. Our calculations indicate that ONIOM(B3LYP)
underestimates the 0 K heat of adsorption significantly. The
heat of adsorption of TiCl 4 onto the SiO 2 surface ( Q ads (TiCl 4 ))
is calculated to be 1.9 and 7.5 kcal/mol, using the ONIOM-
(B3LYP) and ONIOM(CCSD(T)) model chemistries, respec-
tively. Moreover, ONIOM(B3LYP) incorrectly predicts a nega-
tiveQ ads (HCl) because the underestimated electronic stabilization
energy is smaller than the increased ZPE in the adsorption state.
Although heats of adsorption are underestimated at ONIOM-
(B3LYP), the ONIOM(MP2)Q ads are in good agreement with
ONIOM(CCSD(T)) Q ads . Both of the differences of Q ads (TiCl 4 )
and Q ads (HCl) predicted by these two model chemistries are
within 0.3 kcal/mol. Similarly, ONIOM(MP2) is closer to
ONIOM(CCSD(T)) with regards to the activation barrier.
However, for reaction enthalpy (¢H 0 ), ONIOM(B3LYP) is more
consistent with ONIOM(CCSD(T)), as shown in Table 1.
The primary goal of the test calculations was to determine
the relative computational accuracy of the three candidate model
chemistries: B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p), MP2/6-311 ++G(2df,-
2p), CCSD(T)/6-311 ++G(2df,2p). So, a natural question is if
we can extend the conclusions obtained using the ONIOM
compound models to the single-level model chemistries, which
is used for the whole system (not just for the active sites). The
Qads (TiCl 4 ) calculated using the ONIOM compound models and
the single-level models are compared in Figure 3. As illustrated,
the difference between theQ ads calculated using the two single-
level model chemistries (B3LYP/6-311 ++G(2df,2p) and MP2/
6-311 ++G(2df,2p)) is given by:
Our calculations show that ¢Q SM is 7.0 kcal/mol, which is very
close to the difference between the results calculated using the
two ONIOM models (¢Q ONIOM ) 5.3 kcal/mol). There are two
reasons leading to the similarity between ¢Q SM and ¢Q ONIOM .
One is that, due to the localized covalent bonds of the reaction
system, the energetics of the chemical reactions are determined
primarily by the local states of the reactive site. Thus, the level
of theory used to model the active site is the decisive factor for
the computational accuracy of the ONIOM models. Therefore,
the absolute values of¢Q B 3 LYP and ¢Q MP 2 are small and, hence,
lead to similar ¢Q SM and ¢Q ONIOM values. Second, due to the
application of the same model chemistry to the nonactive regions
in all of the ONIOM calculations, any errors induced by the
low level of theory are (at least partially) cancelled, resulting
in a small difference between¢Q SM and ¢Q ONIOM . Due to the
similarity of the results obtained from the ONIOM and the
single-level model chemistries, the computational reliability of
the single-level model chemistries were predicted to be con-
sistent with the trends of the corresponding ONIOM models.
Although CCSD(T) should yield the most reliable results, it
is not a feasible option for our systems due to the tremendous
computational cost. As mentioned above, MP2 is in much better
agreement with CCSD(T) when predictingQ ads than B3LYP,
which underestimates Q ads significantly. Therefore, MP2 was
used to calculate the heats of adsorption in this paper. Similar
results have been observed by Cross and Schlegel.27 They found
that B3LYP/6-311 +G(3df,2p) underestimates NH 3 binding
energies for the TiCl 4 /NH 3 system by 6 -8 kcal/mol, whereas
MP2/6-311 +G(3df,2p) binding energies are very close to the
G2 results. Although our two reaction systems are not identical,
the results should be comparable, due to the same nature of the
adsorption. The TiCl4 /NH 3 complex is similar to the adsorption
complex of our study in that the Lewis acid/base interaction
between Ti and the electron pair donor plays an important role
in the adsorption. Therefore, as expected, the relative perfor-
mances of model chemistries for predicting binding energies
are consistent.
In conclusion, the heats of adsorption and the activation
barriers were obtained using MP2 calculations based on its better
agreement with CCSD(T) results. However, values of ¢H 0
obtained from MP2 were found to be less accurate, and
therefore, the enthalpy of reaction is evaluated using DFT with
the B3LYP functional.
3.2. Reactions On Isolated Hydroxyl Groups. 3.2.1. First
Half-Reaction. When being introduced onto the SiO 2 substrate,
metal-containing precursors (TiI 4 ) can react with the isolated
-OH groups via a ligand-exchange mechanism:
The reaction pathway is initiated by the adsorption of TiI 4
onto the isolated hydroxyl group of the SiO 2 substrate to form
an adsorption complex, as shown in Figure 4a. In the adsorption
state, the Ti-O distance is 2.27 Å and all of the Ti -I bonds
are lengthened to above 2.59 Å, compared to 2.55 Å in the gas
phase. In addition, the coordination geometry of Ti changes from
tetrahedron in the gas phase to trigonal bipyramid in the
adsorption complex. The geometric changes indicate the Lewis
acid/base interactions between the adsorbate and the surface
-OH group. A natural bond orbital (NBO) 28,29 analysis shows
that there are interactions between the oxygen lone pair NBO
and the Ti-I antibond NBOs, which indicates donation of
occupancy from the oxygen lone pair NBO into the empty Ti -I
antibond hybrid orbitals. The accumulation of negative charge
on Ti induces the rehybridization of the Ti group from

4-coordination to 5-coordination and, hence, changes the
coordination geometry. The adsorption interaction is weak, with
a binding energy of 5.7 kcal/mol.
The adsorbed TiI 4 is capable of attacking the surface -OH
group to release HI and leave a -TiI 3 group on the surface,
with the transition state shown in Figure 4b. In the transition
state, the Ti-O distance decreases to 1.90 from 2.27 Å in the
adsorption state. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis shows
that a two-centeróTi -O NBO is formed, although the contribu-
tion to this orbital is mainly from the O (95%). In addition, the
Ti-I distance (3.58 Å) is much longer than that in the adsorption
state (2.66 Å). The NBO analysis reveals that there is no bond
between Ti and I, indicating that the Ti-I bond is completely
broken in the transition state. The H -I distance in the transition
state is 1.95 Å, which is longer than the equilibrium bond
length of a HI molecule (1.61 Å). Although the H-I bond is
not formed completely, the NBO analysis predicts the
presence of aóH -I orbital, which indicates that they can “see”
each other in the transition state. On the other hand, this
calculation predicts a lone pair NBO on the O atom (LP O ),
rather than a two-center bond between H and O, suggesting
that the O-H bond is broken completely. However, it is
important to note the low occupancy (1.75) of the O lone pair
NBO and the large occupancy (0.22) ofóH -I * (star denotes
the non-Lewis NBO) antibonding orbital, which indicates
deviations from idealized Lewis bonding. Second-order pertur-
bation analysis shows strong LPO f óH -I * interaction between
the O lone pair and the H -I antibonding orbital with a
stabilization energy of 199 kcal/mol. This interaction leads
to donation of occupancy from the O lone pair orbital to the
óH -I * antibonding orbital. The delocalization of the lone pair
electrons builds a partial ó bond between O and H and weakens
the ó bond between the H and I. The ZPE-corrected activation
barrier with reference to the adsorption state is 13.5 kcal/mol.
The reaction is exothermic by 9.4 kcal/mol at 0 K. The HI
product may adsorb on the surface, with a binding energy of
2.7 kcal/mol.
To incorporate our calculations into mechanistic models, rate
constants of the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiI 4 reaction were
calculated using eqs 1, 2, and 3. For a Langmuir -Hinshelwood
mechanism, the gas-phase molecules first absorb onto the surface
prior to reacting. Therefore, in our calculations, the activation
barrier is reported with respect to the adsorption complex. In
addition, only vibrational partition functions are used in the rate
constant calculations. The reactant complex and activated
complex are considered to lose all of their translational and
rotational degrees of freedom. The possible exception to this
assumption is that the TiI4 in the adsorption state (Figure 4a)
may have one rotational degree of freedom along the Ti -O
axis. As the rotation along the Ti -O axis couples weakly to
the translational energy leading to desorption, the adsorbate is
likely to stick on the surface with rotational excitation along
this degree of freedom. However, a PES scan estimates that
the rotational barrier is approximately 16 kcal/mol, which is
even larger than the activation barrier of the surface reaction
and was therefore neglected.
The rate constants for this reaction step were calculated from
60 to 723.15 K and are listed in Table 2 (given on a per surface
active site basis). Figure 5 shows this data fit to an Arrhenius
plot. As shown, tunneling plays a critical role in the magnitude
of the rate constant at lower temperatures, resulting ink SC -TST
values that are much larger than k TST values. As shown in Figure
5, the Arrhenius fit of k SC -TST gives two different linear relations
at high temperatures and low temperatures. The classical
Arrhenius temperature dependence is observed in the regime
of high temperatures, and the Arrhenius activation energy is
estimated to be 3.4 kcal/mol. At low temperatures, however,
there is significant deviation of the rate constant from Arrhenius
behavior due to the dominance of quantum tunneling. Using
eq 4, the tunneling crossover temperature (T x ) is calculated to
be 151 K, where the tunneling correction factors ( ¡) drops to
35. Above T x , ¡decreases quickly and the tunneling effect
becomes negligible and, therefore, can be used as a quick
estimate of the tunneling-dominant temperature regime. It has
been found through similar calculations that theT x for the other
reactions studied here are comparable or lower than the T x of
reaction A. Therefore, tunneling effects are predicted to be

negligible for all reactions studied in this work at typical ALD
temperatures.
3.2.2. Second Half-Reaction. The second-half cycle, which
introduces H 2 O into the reactor, will regenerate the surface -OH
groups by:
Like other Langmuir -Hinshelwood reactions, H 2 O first
absorbs onto the surface to form an adsorbed complex. Similar
to the TiCl4 /H 2 O precursor combination, 8 H 2 O can absorb on
top or on side sites of the Ti intermediates. As the atomic
mechanisms of the different adsorption modes and the following
reaction pathways are very similar, for simplicity, we restrict
discussion here to the adsorption of H2 O to the apical sites of
the surface -TiI 3 group (Figure 6a). The NBO analysis reveals
that, in the adsorption state, the interaction between the O1 lone
pair (LP) and theóTi -O2 * antibond NBO gives a stabilization
energy of 67.44 kcal/mol, which indicates the LP f óTi -O2 *
donation of occupancy. A natural population analysis (NPA)
shows that the adsorbed H2 O has a net charge of +0.1 e due to
the charge transfer from the aqueous O to Ti. The charge transfer
leads to the rehybridization of the Ti and changes the coordina-
tion geometry from tetrahedron to trigonal bipyramid. The 0 K
heat of adsorption is calculated to be 6.2 kcal/mol.
After the adsorption of H 2 O, the reaction proceeds via the
transition state shown in Figure 6b. In the transition state, O in
H2 O is bonded to Ti with a bond length of 1.95 Å. NBO analysis
reveals a polarized Ti -O NBO with significant contribution
(95%) from O. The Ti -I distance is increased to 3.88 Å, which
indicates that the bond is broken in the transition state. Also
note that the interaction between the O lone pair and the H-I
antibonding orbital leads to the delocalization of the lone pair
electrons, which indicates the partial breakage of the O-H bond
and the partial formation of the H -I bond. A t 0 K temperature,
the reaction is slightly exothermic by 0.2 kcal/mol with an
activation barrier of 20.3 kcal/mol.
The surface -Ti(OH)I 2 group can be further hydroxylated
by reacting with additional H 2 O molecules through a similar
atomic mechanism, until all of the I atoms on the surface are
replaced by hydroxyl groups. The ZPE-corrected PESs for the
three consecutive hydroxylation reactions are shown in Figure
7. Note that, with an increase in the number of-OH attached
to the Ti atom, the binding energy of H 2 O onto the Ti-containing
group is correspondingly increased. Th e 0 K heats of adsorption
of H 2 O is 6.2 kcal/mol on the -TiI 3 group, 7.5 kcal/mol on the
-Ti(OH)I 2 group, and 8.8 kcal/mol on the -Ti(OH) 2 I group.
This trend is related to the hydrogen bonds between the adsorbed
H2 O and the -OH attached to the Ti atom, which enhances the
adsorption interaction. The ZPE-corrected activation barrier for
the three consecutive hydroxylation reactions is 20.3, 17.7, and
19.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The reaction enthalpy of each
individual reaction is small (-0.2, 3.2, and 1.5 kcal/mol), and
the overal l 0 K reaction enthalpy for replacing all of the three
I atoms bonded to the Ti atom with hydroxyl groups is 4.5 kcal/
mol.
Using eqs 1, 2, and 3, rate constants for the first hydroxylation
reaction (reaction B) were calculated at temperatures between
150 and 450° C, which is the typical temperature range of ALD.
In our calculations, only vibrational partition functions are
considered in the transition state. However, in the adsorption
state, the adsorbed H2 O may have rotational degrees of freedom
in addition to the vibrational degrees of freedom, and neglect
of the rotational motions will lead to errors in the reaction
kinetics. The rotation of an absorbate on a surface is composed

of two types of degrees of freedom. The first is the rotation
perpendicular to the surface. As this type of rotation has strong
coupling to normal translation and, hence, enhances desorption,
it is not taken into account in the adsorption state. The second
is called in-plane rotation, which rotates about the Ti-O1 axis
shown in Figure 6a. As the energy transfer of the in-plane
rotational motion to the normal translational motion is very
small, the excitation of the in-plane rotation has little influence
on desorption. Therefore, we assume that H2 O can only rotate
about the Ti -O1 axis in the adsorption state. Being adsorbed
on the surface, however, H 2 O cannot undergo free rotation due
to the directional interaction with the substrate. A PES scan
predicts that the potential barrier of the rotation (V 0 ) is 1.6 kcal/
mol. At the typical temperatures of ALD, k B T is very close in
magnitude to V 0 . As a result, we can neither treat the rotation
as free rotation nor as torsional vibration. In our calculations,
the partition function of the hindered rotor is calculated by an
approach developed by Fernandez;30 where
In the equations above,  is the angle of rotation, I is an effective
moment of inertia for the in-plane rotation, k B is Boltzmann’s
constant, T is temperature, V ( ) is the potential energy of the
in-plane rotation, and ó is the number of rotational potential
wells, which is 2 for the system being studied. Following
Nielsen,31 the potential is approximated by
where V 0 is the potential energy barrier of the rotation.
The rate constants calculated are given in Table 3. k TST is
very close to k SC -TST due to the negligible tunneling effects.
The rate constants for the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * + H 2 O reaction
are 6 -7 orders of magnitude smaller than the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH*
+ TiI 4 reaction, indicating that the second half-reaction is much
slower than the first half-reaction.
To better understand the effects of the restricted rotational
motions of the adsorbed H 2 O on the rate constants, we also
calculated the rate constants by using the free rotational model
(V 0 ) 0, ó ) 1) and by completely ignoring the rotation of

H 2 O( q rot ) 1). Figure 8 presents the rate constants of the
(SiH 3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * + H 2 O reaction calculated with three
different models of adsorbate rotation. Note that including the
rotation of H2 O decreases the rate constant. As more rotation
is included, the free energy of the adsorbed complex decreases,
which increases the overall free energy activation barrier of the
reaction. In addition, the inclusion of the restricted rotation leads
to a smaller Arrhenius activation energy (4.8 kcal/mol) than
with the rotation excluded (5.1 kcal/mol). If the H2 O rotation
is treated as free rotation, however, the rotational entropy will
be overestimated, which will lead to an underestimation of the
rate constant.
3.3. Reactions On Adjacent Hydrogen-Bonded Hydroxyl
Groups. 3.3.1. First Half-Reaction. Different from the reac-
tions on isolated hydroxyl groups, the reaction between TiI 4
and adjacent hydroxyl groups can form -TiI 2 groups on the
surface via two consecutive reactions.
When the TiI 4 molecule approaches the surface, it can stick
to one of the adjacent hydroxyl groups via nonactivated
adsorption. Due to the lateral interaction of the adjacent hydroxyl
groups, the ZPE-including binding energy of TiI4 (9.0 kcal/
mol) is larger than that on isolated hydroxyl groups (5.7 kcal/
mol). As shown in Figure 9a, the adjacent hydroxyl groups form
a weak H1-O2 hydrogen bond, which lengthens the O1 -H1
bond to 0.99 Å and decreases the H1 -O1 -Si1 bond angle to
108.8 ° . A NBO analysis reveals that the interaction between
the O2 lone pair (LP) and the óH1 -O1 * antibond NBO gives a
stabilization energy of 20.09 kcal/mol, which leads to donation
of occupancy from the O2 lone pair to theóH1 -O1 * antibond
NBO. The delocalization of the O2 lone pair electrons makes
O1 more negatively charged and increases its charge-donating
ability. As a result, Ti and O1 show stronger Lewis acid/base
interaction, which decreases the Ti-O1 distance to 2.24 Å and
increases the binding energy of the TiI4 . After being adsorbed
on the top site of one of the adjacent hydroxyl groups, TiI 4 can
hop to the bridge site of the adjacent hydroxyl groups to form
a more stable adsorption complex (Figure 9b). This process
involves overcoming a barrier of 3.6 kcal/mol to break the
hydrogen bond. In the bridge-site adsorption state, Ti has 6-fold
coordination with a coordination geometry that is roughly
octahedral, which indicates that both of the two oxygen atoms
(O1 and O2) donate electrons to Ti to form the adsorption
complex. The binding energy of TiI4 to the bridge site is 11.3
kcal/mol, which is larger than that to the top site and is therefore
favored energetically.
With TiI 4 adsorbed on the bridge site, reaction C proceeds
through the transition state shown in Figure 9c. The transition
state occurs late, where the Ti-I bond has been broken and
corresponds to a distance of 3.85 Å. The Ti -O distance is
decreased to 1.95 Å, indicating the formation of the Ti -O bond.
The H -O bond is partially broken and the H -I distance is
decreased to 1.94 Å where they can now “see” each other. The
activation barrier with reference to the bridge-site adsorption
state is 12.7 kcal/mol. The 0 K enthalpy of reaction is -8.0
kcal/mol, and the HI product may adsorb on the surface with a
binding energy of 4.4 kcal/mol.
The -TiI 3 group can further react with the adjacent surface
hydroxyl group to liberate another HI via reaction D, with the

transition state shown in Figure 9d. The Ti -I and H -O
distances are lengthened, whereas the Ti -O distance is short-
ened in the transition state. The reaction is exothermic by 2.0
kcal/mol with the ZPE-including activation barrier of 14.7 kcal/
mol.
The rate constants for the two consecutive reactions were
calculated at various temperatures using eqs 1, 2, and 3. Only
vibrational partition functions were included. Table 4 and Table
5 present rate constants for reactions C and D, respectively.
Although the rate constants of reaction D are 2 orders of
magnitude smaller than that of reaction C, both of the reactions
are very fast at temperatures between 150 and 450° C. In
addition, the rate constants of reaction D are very close to that
of the reaction between TiI4 and isolated hydroxyl groups. This
result shows that both types of hydroxyl groups have similar
reactivity toward TiI4 precursors.
3.3.2. Second Half-Reaction. During the exposure of H 2 O,
the surface -TiI 2 group deposited during the first half-cycle
can be hydroxylated with the removal of the surface I atom via
the following reaction.
Similar to the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * + H 2 O reaction, H 2 O
molecules first adsorb onto the -TiI 2 species to form an
adsorbed complex (Figure 10a). Like the binding of H 2 Ot ot h e
surface -TiI 3 species described above, the adsorption process
involves a Lewis acid/base interaction between Ti and O.
Following the formation of the adsorbed complex, the H 2 Oi s
capable of attacking the -TiI 2 species. As the Ti -O distance
is shortened, the H -O and Ti -I bond is lengthened. Figure
10b depicts the transition state, which occurs late, with the
breakage of the Ti-I bond and the partial formation of the H -I
bond. After liberating one HI, the surface -Ti(OH)I group can
be further hydroxylated by reacting with another H 2 O molecule
through a similar mechanism. The ZPE-corrected PESs for the
two consecutive hydroxylation reactions are shown in Figure
11. The two reactions have almost identical activation barriers
(22.2 and 22.4 kcal/mol). The overall 0 K reaction enthalpy for
the two exchange reactions is 2.6 kcal/mol.
The rate constants for reaction E were calculated at various
temperatures using eqs 1, 2, and 3 and are listed in Table 6.
Vibrational partition functions were used in the calculations,
as well as the partition function for the hindered rotation of the
adsorbed H2 O. The rate constants for reaction E are 1 order of
magnitude smaller than the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * + H 2 O
reaction. The lower rate constants of reaction E are attributed
to the slightly higher activation barrier and larger rotational
partition function of the adsorbed H2 O due to a larger effective
moment of inertia.
3.4. Reactions On Oxygen Bridges. 3.4.1. Reaction of TiI 4
with Oxygen Bridge. When being brought to the SiO 2 surface,
the TiI 4 precursors can react not only with hydroxyl groups but
also with oxygen bridges by the following reaction.
This reaction is initiated with the attachment of TiI 4 to the
oxygen bridge (Figure 12a), where the surface provides a Lewis
base site (O) for coordination to Ti. The heat of adsorption is
9.2 kcal/mol at 0 K. After the adsorption of the TiI4 onto the
surface, reaction F proceeds via the transition state shown in
Figure 12b. In the transition state, the Ti-O distance decreases
to 1.90 from 2.22 Å in the adsorption state. A NBO analysis
shows that a two-centeróTi -O is formed with significant
contribution (95%) from O, and the Ti -I1 bond is almost broken
at a distance of 3.03 Å. Second-order perturbation analysis
reveals that the interaction between the I1 lone pair and the
ó4 * antibond NBO gives a stabilization energy of 150.19 kcal/
mol. This strong interaction leads to delocalization from the I1
lone pair to the unfilledóTi -I4 * antibond NBO. As a result, the
Ti-I4 bond is 0.04 Å longer than the Ti -I2 (or Ti-I3) bond,
whereas the Ti -I1 bond is not broken completely. In addition,
in the transition state, the Si -O bond is partially broken at a
distance of 2.07 Å and the Si -I1 bond is partially formed at a
distance of 2.69 Å. The ZPE-including activation barrier for
reaction F is 15.7 kcal/mol, which is close to that of the reactions
between TiI4 and hydroxyl groups. However, the reaction of
TiI 4 with the oxygen bridge leads to a much more stable product,
w i t ha0K reaction enthalpy of -23.3 kcal/mol.
The rate constants of reaction F were calculated at temper-
atures between 150 and 450 ° C and only vibrational partition
functions were used in the calculations (see Table 7). Compared
to the reactions of TiI4 with hydroxyl groups, the rate constant

of the reaction between TiI 4 and the oxygen bridges are 2 orders
of magnitude smaller. However, oxygen bridges still exhibit high
chemical reactivity toward TiI4 precursors at temperatures
between 150 ° C and 450 ° C.
3.4.2. Reaction of H 2 O with Surface Iodine. When a vapor
dose of the second precursor (H 2 O) is brought to the surface,
both of the adjacent surface species ( -TiI 3 and -I) produced
by reaction F can react with H 2 O. As the reaction of H 2 O with
the -TiI 3 species has been described above, we restrict our
discussion here to the reaction of H 2 O with the surface iodine
species, as shown below.
The ZPE-corrected PES for reaction G is shown in Figure
13. The reaction pathway is initiated with the binding of H 2 O
to the surface through a configuration shown in Figure 13a.
H2 O binds through the Ti -O1 and H -O2 interaction, where
the Ti -O1 distance is 2.26 Å and the H -O2 distance is 1.90
Å, and the ZPE-including binding energy is 5.8 kcal/mol. The
adsorbed H2 O is capable of attacking the -TiI 3 species to release
a HCl via an atomic mechanism similar to that described above.
An alternative reaction is the reaction of the adsorbed H2 O with
the adjacent surface iodine species via a reaction pathway
(Figure 13) which involves a metastable intermediate and two
transition states. Starting from the initial adsorption state, the
H2 O is able to adjust its direction so that the lone pair of the

aqueous oxygen can directly attack the silicon attached to the
iodine in a nucleophilic fashion. As shown in Figure 13, H 2 O
has to overcome a larger energy barrier (15.9 kcal/mol) to attach
to the surface Si site and reach the intermediate metastable state
(Figure 13c). This larger barrier is related to the energy cost
required to deform the cluster structure, which then leads to a
high-energy intermediate. As H2 O approaches Si, the Si -O bond
becomes stronger due to the donation of charge from the O
lone pair to the empty levels of Si. Meanwhile, the cluster
structure becomes distorted by swinging out the surface iodine.
In the metastable intermediate, the Si-O distance is 1.85 Å,
which is much longer than that in the final product (1.64 Å).
This indicates that the overlap of the O lone pair orbitals and
the accepting orbitals of Si is restricted due to steric hindrance,
and hence, the Si-O bonding is weak. It turns out that the
energy gained due to the bonding of H 2 O to Si is smaller than
the high-energy cost for the distortion of the cluster structure.
Therefore, the intermediate is 8.5 kcal/mol higher in energy than
the separated reactants. Release of HI from the intermediate is
nearly a barrierless process, with a very small activation barrier
of 0.2 kcal/mol. The overall 0 K reaction enthalpy of reaction
Gi s -13.0 kcal/mol.
The reaction of H 2 O with surface iodine can be represented
as a multistep reaction:
where R is the reactant-like adsorbed complex (Figure 13a),
M is the metastable intermediate (Figure 13c), and P is the
product-like adsorbed complex. As the HI products are continu-
ously removed from the reactor in the ALD process, the reverse
reaction from P to M is neglected. A comparison of the

activation barriers of the step reactions (Figure 13) shows that
the consumption rate of the intermediate ( k f * and k r ) is orders
of magnitude faster than the formation rate of the intermediate
(k f ). Therefore, we assume that there is no accumulation of the
short-lived intermediate. On the basis of this assumption, the
overall rate constants of reaction G from the adsorption state is
calculated by
where k f is the rate constant of the forward reaction from R to
M and ç is the scale factor, which represents the probability of
forward reaction from M to P and is given by
where ¢G
/
f is the free energy activation barrier of the reaction
f r o mMt oP ,a n d ¢G r is the free energy activation barrier of
the reaction from M to R. The rate constants, k f and k overall are
listed in Table 8. As shown, ç decreases from 0.72 at 150 ° C
to 0.50 at 450 ° C. This indicates that the probability to form
the final product P from the intermediate M decreases as
the temperature increases. The overall rate constants are 4
orders of magnitude larger than that of the reaction of H2 O
with the -TiI 3 species, indicating that the surface iodine
attached to Si has higher reactivity toward H 2 O than the iodine
attached to Ti.
3.5. Iodine Release Reaction. During the ALD of TiO 2 ,
Aarik and co-workers 32 observed that, after switching off the
TiI 4 pulse, there is mass decrease ( ¢m p ) of the film, which is
characterized in situ by a quartz crystal microbalance. The ¢m p
depended on the purge duration at high temperatures, but the
mass increment per cycle ( ¢m 0 ) did not. Therefore, they
attributed the ¢m p to the release of iodine from surface
intermediate species. To examine the possibility of the release
of iodine at typical ALD temperatures, we investigated the
following reaction.
The ZPE-corrected PES and selected stationary point struc-
tures of reaction H is shown in Figure 14. The two adjacent
-TiI 3 species (Figure 14a) can attack each other to release an
iodine molecule via the transition state shown in Figure 14b.
In the transition state, the Ti1-Ti2 distance is reduced to 3.28
Å, where the Ti1 -Ti2 bonding interaction is observed due to
the overlap of the sd orbitals on the two Ti (Figure 15a). The
Ti1-I2 bond has been broken at a distance of 3.14 Å, whereas
the Ti2 -I4 bond has not yet been broken completely at a
distance of 2.80 Å due to the partial overlap between the I p
orbital and the Ti sd orbitals. The redistribution of electron
density changes the coordination geometry of Ti from tetrahe-
dron in the initial reactant state to trigonal bipyramid in the
transition state. After passing through the transition state, I2
and I4 bond with each other to form an iodine molecule. Figure
14c presents the product-like adsorption equilibrium structure,
where the structure is stabilized due to the increased overlap
between I p orbitals and Ti sd orbitals (Figure 15b). All of the
Ti -I bonds are longer in the product than in the reactant. This
is attributed to the rehybridization of Ti, which decreases the
electron density between the Ti and I, and hence, increases the
distance between Ti atoms and I atoms (especially I1 and I6).
The iodine release reaction is strongly endothermic by 57.8 kcal/
mol with a large activation barrier of 61.9 kcal/mol.
The rate constants of the iodine release reaction were
calculated at temperatures between 150 and 450 ° C, and only
vibrational partition functions were used in the calculations. The
calculated rate constants are listed in Table 9. Due to the large
activation barrier, the rate constant of the iodine release reaction
is very small and even at 450° C is only on the order of 10 -11
s -1 . The extremely low rate suggests that the iodine release
reaction cannot be used to explain the phenomena observed by
Aarik and co-workers. Whereas the decomposition of the surface
intermediate species is not a plausible explanation, we believe
that the observed¢m p may be attributed to the following two
possible factors.
One possibility is the release of HI by the reactions of
intermediate species with the remaining unreacted hydroxyl
groups on the surface. It is found that the aggregation of the
TiO2 film (prepared by ALD) increases with an increase of the
growth temperature. 33,34 The enhanced migration of intermediate
species at high temperatures increases their ability to reach the
unreacted hydroxyl groups and react with them to release HI.
Therefore, at high temperatures, the diffusion-reaction mecha-
nism can lead to¢m p observed after switching off the TiI 4 and
explain the dependence of ¢m p on the purge duration.
The second explanation involves the desorption of TiI 4 from
the surface. At high coverage, the adsorption of the TiI 4 onto
the surface is expected to be an activated adsorption, due to
the lateral interactions between intermediate species and ad-
sorbates. Although activated adsorption is not likely to occur
at low temperatures, the probability can be increased by
moderately increasing the temperature. Therefore, at elevated
temperatures, the enhanced activated adsorption leads to the
increase of the mass of the film during the TiI4 dose, which
has been observed by Aarik and co-workers. 32 However, the
TiI 4 absorbed through activated adsorption may not react further
with the surface functional groups because of the large activation
barrier due to steric hindrance. Therefore, after switching off
the TiI4 pulse, the adsorbed TiI 4 can desorb from the surface,
leading to the mass decrease ( ¢m p ) of the thin film. This is
consistent with the fact that, in practice, the deposition per cycle

is usually half of a monolayer or less. As the desorption of the
unreacted TiI 4 is also an activated process due to the lateral
interactions, it cannot occur as fast as nonactivated physical
desorption. Therefore, the¢m p is dependent on the purge
duration. Moreover, the mass increment per cycle ( ¢m 0 )i s
minimally affected because the adsorption only involves the TiI 4
not chemically bonded to the surface. Unfortunately, it is not
computationally practical to use ab initio cluster calculations
to test these two explanations. However, in future work, we
plan to investigate the mechanisms described above using larger-
scale simulation models.
3.6. Comparison of the TiI 4 and TiCl 4 Precursors. The
choice of precursors is a critical determinant of the success of
an ALD process. The TiCl4 /H 2 O precursor combination used
in TiO 2 ALD has been modeled previously, 8 so here, we
compare the effect of these two metal precursors (TiCl 4 and
TiI 4 ) on ALD reaction energetics. To be consistent with the
model chemistry used here, the energetics of ALD with the
TiCl4 /H 2 O precursors is calculated at MP2/6-311 ++G(2df,2p)//
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). The comparison of the ZPE-corrected PESs
for the (SiH3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiI 4 and (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiCl 4
reactions is illustrated in Figure 16. It can be observed that the
PES of the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiCl 4 reaction is much deeper
than that of the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiI 4 reaction at the
adsorption equilibrium structure and TS structure. This down-
ward shift is due to the stronger interaction between the TiCl 4
and the -OH group on the surface. Since the Cl is more
effective at withdrawing charge than I, Ti in TiCl 4 shows better
electron acceptor character, which results in stronger Lewis acid/
base interactions between Ti and O and decreases the potential
energy of the adsorption complex and the TS structure. As a
result, the 0 K heat of adsorption of TiCl 4 (10.2 kcal/mol) is

much larger than that of TiI 4 (5.7 kcal/mol). As the Cl ligands
stabilize both the reactant complex and the TS, the two reactions
have almost identical activation barriers, 13.5 kcal/mol for the
(SiH3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiI 4 reaction and 13.7 kcal/mol for the
(SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiCl 4 reaction. In addition, the (SiH 3 O) 3 -
Si -OH* + TiI 4 reaction is more exothermic (9.4 kcal/mol) than
the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -OH* + TiCl 4 reaction (6.5 kcal/mol).
The calculated energetics for the initial surface reactions
involved in ALD of TiO 2 using the TiI 4 precursor are presented
in Table 10, where the energetics of the corresponding reactions
using the TiCl4 precursor are displayed in parentheses. As
shown, all of the adsorption heats in the TiCl 4 /H 2 O ALD process
are larger than that in the TiI 4 /H 2 O ALD process. The more
charge-withdrawing Cl ligand attached to Ti increases the
binding energies by enhancing the Lewis acid/base interactions
between Ti and O. Substitution of TiCl4 with TiI 4 as the
precursor does not appreciably change the activation barriers.
Therefore, the rates of reaction are predicted to be very similar
for these two reaction systems, even though the Ti-Cl bond is
stronger than the Ti -I bond. As the kinetics depend on the
energy needed to reach the transition state, bond energies cannot
be used to predict the kinetics of a reaction. For example,
although the Ti-I bond energy is smaller than the Ti -Cl bond
energy, the activation energy of the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * +
H 2 O reaction is slightly larger than that of the (SiH 3 O) 3 Si -
O -TiCl 3 * + H 2 O reaction, as shown in Table 10. A closer
examination of the PESs of the two reactions shows that the
larger activation barrier of the (SiH3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * + H 2 O
reaction is attributed to a later transition state compared to the
(SiH3 O) 3 Si -O -TiCl 3 * + H 2 O reaction. To reach the transition
state, the Ti -I distance is increased by 1.05 Å, while the Ti -
Cl distance is increased by only 0.64 Å. Therefore, slightly more
energy is required for the (SiH3 O) 3 Si -O -TiI 3 * + H 2 O reaction
to lengthen the Ti -I bond to reach the transition state.
Although the difference in strengths between the Ti -I and
Ti -Cl bonds did not change the kinetics appreciably, the
thermodynamics of the reactions are influenced considerably.
As shown in Table 10, the reactions in the TiI4 /H 2 O ALD
process are more exothermic than the reactions in the TiCl 4 /
H 2 O ALD process. At ALD reaction conditions, a larger
thermodynamic driving force suggests that reactions can proceed
further toward completion and that the gas-phase products can
be removed more completely. Therefore, the TiI4 precursor tends
to produce TiO 2 films with fewer impurities than the TiCl 4
precursor. For example, the SiO 2 -I* + H 2 O reaction (reaction
G) is much more exothermic (13.0 kcal/mol) than the SiO 2 -
Cl* + H 2 O reaction (5.7 kcal/mol). The larger exothermicity
suggests that surface iodine can be removed more completely
than surface chlorine. This conclusion is consistent with the
experiment by Schuisky and co-workers,35 which shows that
TiO 2 films grown by ALD using TiI 4 as metal precursors are
iodine free. In addition, the larger thermodynamic driving force
allows lower deposition temperatures for TiI4 /H 2 O ALD than
for TiCl 4 /H 2 O ALD.
4. Conclusions
The initial surface reactions involved in ALD of TiO 2 from
TiI 4 and H 2 O onto a SiO 2 substrate have been investigated using
electronic structure calculations based on cluster models. The
detailed atomic growth mechanisms on different types of
functional groups of the SiO2 substrate have been proposed.
During the metal precursor pulse, TiI 4 can adsorb on different
types of active sites and become chemically bonded to the

surface via different exchange reactions. For example, TiI 4 can
react with isolated hydroxyl groups to form a -TiI 3 species or
react with adjacent hydroxyl groups to form a -TiI 2 species.
In addition, TiI 4 can react with oxygen bridges to form adjacent
-TiI 3 and -I species on the surface. Our calculations show
that all of the investigated initial reactions have large rate
constants at temperatures between 150 and 450° C, which
indicates that all of the three surface functionalities exhibit high
chemical reactivity toward TiI4 precursors at typical ALD
temperatures.
When H 2 O is introduced onto the surface during the second
half-cycle, it can react with any of the intermediate species
deposited during the TiI4 pulse. The -TiI 3 intermediate species
can react with three consecutive H 2 O molecules to form a -Ti-
(OH) 3 species on the surface. Similarly, H 2 O can continuously
react with the -TiI 2 intermediate to form a surface -Ti(OH) 2
group. The rate constants of these reactions are 5 -8 orders of
magnitude smaller than the first half-reactions between TiI 4 and
surface functionalities. These results suggest that the recovery
of the hydroxyl groups on the Ti-including intermediates by
reacting with H2 O is much slower than the deposition of metal
precursors onto the surface. We have also investigated the
reaction of H 2 O with the surface iodine species attached to Si.
This reaction removes the surface iodine and yields a surface
hydroxyl group via a mechanism which involves a metastable
intermediate and two transition states. The reaction of H2 O with
the surface iodine attached to Si is much faster than with the
Ti-including intermediates, based on the rate constants calcu-
lated. This result suggests that the surface iodine attached to Si
will not be a major source of iodine impurity in the TiO2 thin
film. In addition, the atomic mechanism of iodine release from
the intermediate species has been investigated. The release of
an iodine molecule from the two adjacent Ti-including inter-
mediates was found to be kinetically and thermodynamically
unfavorable. On the basis of the extremely low rate constants,
the iodine release reaction is predicted to be very unlikely to
occur at typical ALD temperatures.
The effects of quantum tunneling and hindered rotations of
adsorbates on the rate of surface reactions have been investi-
gated. The effects of tunneling were found to be negligible for
all reactions at typical ALD temperatures range from 150 to
450° C. However, the hindered rotational contributions of
adsorbed H 2 O to the rate constants must be taken into account
due to the small rotational potential energy barrier.
Comparison of TiI 4 and TiCl 4 shows that the more charge-
withdrawing Cl ligands can increase the binding energies of
the absorbates onto the surface. Although the activation
barriers of the initial surface reactions are very similar for TiI4 /
H 2 O and TiCl 4 /H 2 O ALD reacting systems, the reactions in the
TiI 4 /H 2 O ALD process are more exothermic than the reactions
in the TiCl 4 /H 2 O ALD process, which suggests that the TiI 4
precursor tends to produce TiO 2 films with fewer impurities
than the TiCl 4 precursor due to the larger thermodynamic driving
force.

It is important that our kinetic results be interpreted with an
understanding of the complexity of the whole picture of ALD
dynamics, which involves adsorption, desorption, surface dif-
fusion, surface reaction and structural relaxation. For a multistep
Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction, the rate-determining step
(RDS) can be any one of the events (adsorption, desorption,
surface diffusion, or surface reaction) depending upon reaction
conditions. In this work, we examined the rates of the surface
reaction steps, which are important for identifying the RDS and
understanding the overall dynamics. At high pressure and low
temperature, the deposition of the precursors onto the surface
is limited by a fast adsorption-desorption equilibrium followed
by slow surface reactions. In this situation, the surface reaction
is the RDS and the rate constants of the surface reactions can
be used as an indication of the rate of the overall dynamics. At
low pressure and high temperature, however, surface reaction
and desorption are very fast and adsorption becomes the RDS.
At the reaction conditions in which adsorption is the RDS, using
precursors with large binding energies on the surface may speed
up the rate of deposition due to the faster adsorption rate, for
example, the TiCl4 /H 2 O ALD process is predicted to be faster
than the TiI 4 /H 2 O ALD process at low pressure and high
temperature. It is also important that our kinetic results be
interpreted within the context of low coverage. At high coverage,
the lateral interactions of the surface species may change the
energetics or even the mechanisms of the reactions. The more
complicated dynamic mechanisms at high coverage exceed the
capabilities of cluster-based ab initio calculations. In the future,
we plan to study coverage dependence using periodic DFT
calculations based on tight-binding techniques and force-field
simulations.
