Surface chemistry of copper metal and copper
oxide atomic layer deposition from copper(II)
acetylacetonate: a combined first-principles and
reactive molecular dynamics study†
Xiao Hu,* a Jo ¨rg Schuster, b Stefan E. Schulz ab and Thomas Gessner ab
Atomistic mechanisms for the atomic layer deposition using the Cu(acac) 2 (acac = acetylacetonate)
precursor are studied using first-principles calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations.
The results show that Cu(acac)2 chemisorbs on the hollow site of the Cu(110) surface and decomposes
easily into a Cu atom and the acac-ligands. A sequential dissociation and reduction of the Cu precursor
[Cu(acac)2 - Cu(acac) - Cu] are observed. Further decomposition of the acac-ligand is unfavorable on
the Cu surface. Thus additional adsorption of the precursors may be blocked by adsorbed ligands.
Molecular hydrogen is found to be nonreactive towards Cu(acac) 2 on Cu(110), whereas individual
H atoms easily lead to bond breaking in the Cu precursor upon impact, and thus release the surface
ligands into the gas-phase. On the other hand, water reacts with Cu(acac) 2 on a Cu 2 O substrate through
a ligand-exchange reaction, which produces gaseous H(acac) and surface OH species. Combustion
reactions with the main by-products CO2 and H 2 O are observed during the reaction between Cu(acac) 2
and ozone on the CuO surface. The reactivity of diﬀerent co-reactants toward Cu(acac) 2 follows the
order H 4 O 3 4 H 2 O.
Introduction
Copper interconnects have been widely used to replace aluminum
in ultralarge-scale integrated circuitry due to their low resistivity and
superior resistance to electromigration.1 Of the various deposition
techniques applied for Cu metallization, electrochemical deposition
(ECD) is the preferred choice. However, the ECD process requires
conductive seed layers. Moreover, diﬀusion barrier films are needed
to deposit between the Cu seed layer and the patterned dielectrics in
order to prevent the migration of Cu into the Si substrate and the
dielectrics.2 So far, ionized physical vapor deposition (iPVD) using
ionized sputtering techniques in combination with high re-sputter
ratio regimes has been adopted as the desirable method for the
barrier and Cu seed layer deposition.3 However, with the ongoing
scaling down and aspect ratio increase of devices, iPVD tends to fail
due to its inherent nonconformal deposition characteristic.
One promising alternative for making uniform and conformal
Cu thin films is atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is a gas-phase
thin film deposition technique basedon sequential, self-terminating
reactions between the surface and precursors. 4,5 The typical
ALD process consists of four repetitive steps. The precursor
(typically a metal compound) chemisorbs on reactive sites,
saturates the surface and releases the reaction by-products.
After that, unreacted precursor molecules as well as gaseous
byproducts are purged from the reactor. The co-reactant (typically
a non-metal compound) is then supplied to clean up the surface
of contaminations and deposit the desired species (e.g. oxygen or
hydroxyl groups). Finally, another purging phase is introduced to
evacuate the excessive reactants and products. By repeating
these steps, the film growth is self-limiting, which leads to
excellent step coverage and conformal deposition on high aspect
ratio structures.
Precursor chemistry plays a key role in ALD. The candidate
metal precursors must be volatile, thermally stable, and reactive.
Moreover, a low-temperature process (ideally atr160 1C) is desir-
able for Cu ALD in order to avoid the agglomeration of Cu at
elevated temperatures.6 Recently, a number of Cu precursors have
been tested for chemical vapor deposition and ALD applications,
such as b-diketiminates,7,8 b-diketonates,9–11 amidinates,12,13
aminoalkoxides,14 guanidinate,15,16 iminopyrrolidinate.17,18
Among them, the Cu b-diketonate family is promising because
of its high stability and relatively low vapor pressure. The direct
Cu ALD process using Cu(acac)2 and H 2 requires a deposition

temperature of above 250 1C, and is thus undesirable. 19 The
deposition temperature can be reduced below 100 1C by utiliz-
ing the plasma enhanced ALD technology. 20,21 However, such a
process would lead to high roughness and reduced step cover-
age of ALD, which may not be applicable for high aspect ratio
structures.22 On the other hand, several indirect ALD routes to
Cu films have been reported. These approaches consist of two
steps: (1) ALD of the Cu oxide or nitride, and (2) reduction into
the metallic Cu with a reducing agent. Waechtleret al.10
investigated the ALD of Cu 2O thin films on different diffusion
barriers (e.g. T a ,T a N ,a n dR u )u s i n g(nBu3P)2Cu(acac) (Bu = butyl)
and wet oxygen. The deposited Cu 2O can be reduced easily to Cu
metal using formic acid as the reducing agent assisted by a Ru
catalyst.10 Knisley et al.23 proposed the low temperature deposi-
tion of high purity Cu metal through the reduction of ALD copper
formate using hydrazine. Further theoretical studies revealed that
a hydrazine undergoes cleavage to form NH2 moieties, which
then abstracts H of the formate intermediate and spontaneously
forms NH 3 and CO 2 by-products.24 More recently, Park et al.25
reported ALD of Cu 3N followed by reduced annealing in H 2.S u c h
processes may avoid the oxidization of barrier metal below the
Cu seed layer.
There have been a few experimental and theoretical studies
on the surface chemistry of Cu( I) and Cu( II) b-diketonates. In
general, the Cu( I) b-diketonates are more reactive compared
to Cu( II) b-diketonates. However, the main limitation of Cu( I)
b-diketonates is that these precursors may easily undergo a
disproportionation reaction, which defeats the self-limiting
nature of ALD processes.9 Previous in situ X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) results suggest that the disproportionation
of the (nBu3P)2Cu(acac) precursor, which deposits metallic
Cu and releases gaseous Cu(acac) 2, starts above 200 1Co n
SiO2 or above 125 1C on the Co substrate. 26,27 Hence, the upper
temperature limit for copper ALD using this precursor lies
below these temperatures. Another important issue regarding
Cu b-diketonates is the redox chemistry during the ALD. In many
cases, especially when metal ALD is desired, the metal center in a
precursor is required to undergo an oxidation or reduction step.
It is generally assumed that such a step is accomplished during
the second ALD half-cycle, which is associated with the promo-
tion of a co-reactant.28 Recent surface-science studies, however,
illuminated that oxidation state changes in the metal can occur
upon precursor activated adsorption on the substrate, involving
the partial loss and transformation of ligands. For example, the
initial loss of acac-ligands of the Cu(acac)2 precursor was
observed at 200 and 235 K for Ni(110) and Cu(110) single-crystal
surfaces, respectively.29 The formation of a metal–Cu(acac)
complex was proposed. An obvious oxidation state change of
Cu has been seen between 250 and 300 K. The adsorbed
Cu(acac) species lose their remaining acac-ligands and Cu2+ is
completely reduced to metallic Cu. 29
In this work, the surface chemistry of Cu(acac) 2 on the
Cu(110) surface is revisited theoretically. Recently, quantum
chemistry (QC), in particular density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, has become a powerful tool to explicit the ALD
chemistry at an atomic scale.30–49 Dey et al.31 investigated the
transmetalation reactions in Cu ALD using diethylzinc as the
reducing agent, following experiments by Lee et al.8 Lin et al.32
have investigated the competition between ligand-exchange reac-
tions and surface decomposition of Cu(acac) 2 on a Si(100)-2 /C21
surface. More recently, we have studied the surface reactions of
(nBu3P)2Cu(acac) and Cu(acac)2 precursors on a Ta(110) surface.33
Ta is found to exhibit high activity towards the decomposition
of Cu precursors, which is consistent with earlier results.9,34,35
Based on thermodynamic modeling, a combustion-like reaction
during the O3 or wet O 2 pulse, with CO 2 and H 2O as the main
by-products, has been proposed. 33
An alternative QC approach for investigating ALD chemistry
involves ab initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD), which have been
carried out on the simulation of SiO 2
43,44 and HfO 2
45 ALD. As
compared to the ‘‘static’’ ab initio calculations, AIMD oﬀers a
dynamic description of the time evolution of a chemical reac-
tion. Unfortunately, due to the costs of treating the electronic
degrees of freedom, the AIMD study is restricted to model
systems consisting of a few hundred atoms and to very short
time scales (tens of ps). We thus perform molecular dynamics
simulation of Cu ALD using reactive force field (ReaxFF).50
ReaxFF was developed to bridge the gap between QC and empirical
force field, which enables the simulation of comparatively large
systems for long time scales (e.g. tens of thousands of atoms for
the ns scale). 50 Unlike other traditional non-reactive force fields,
ReaxFF oﬀers an accurate description of the bond forming or
breaking process. 50
Previously, the surface reaction of similar metal b-diketonate
of Ir(acac)3 was studied in situusing a quadrupole mass spectro-
meter and a quartz crystal microbalance. 51 In that work, CO 2 and
H2O were confirmed as the main reaction by-products during
IrO2 ALD.51 However, the elementary-step ALD reaction mecha-
nisms are still unclear, since some fast reactions that involve
unstable intermediates are diﬃcult to be observed experi-
mentally. Alternatively, reactive molecular dynamics (RMD)
simulation provides a possibility to capture the reactions that
occurred in ALD in a femtosecond timescale. In the present
article, we focus on the surface chemistry of Cu(acac)2 by means
of DFT calculations and RMD simulations. It is found that
Cu(acac)2 is dissociated easily into a Cu atom and the acac-
ligands on both metallic Cu and Cu oxide surfaces. The
dissociated acac-ligands are thermodynamically stable on the
surface, and can be removed by co-reactants during the next ALD
half-cycle. The mechanisms for the surface reactions between
Cu(acac)2 and diﬀerent co-reactants ( i.e. H2, atomic H, H 2O,
and O 3) are also discussed.

was sampled using a 2 /C22 /C21 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh.55
To investigate the physisorption of the Cu precursor on the
surface, we used a nonlocal van der Waals density functional
(vdW-DF)56 as implemented in QE. The geometry was optimized
until the total energy changes and all components of all forces
are smaller than 1.26/C210/C04 eV and 2.57 /C210/C02 eV Å /C01,
respectively. With the optimized structures, the vibration prop-
erties of adsorbed species were calculated using the harmonic
approximation based on density-functional perturbation theory.57

All bonded energy terms include bond order dependence,
which are determined by the local environment of each atom.
The Coulomb termECoulomb is taken into account for all atom
pairs. A shielded Coulomb potential was used to adjust for
orbital overlap between atoms that were close together. Atomic
charges are computed using the geometry-dependent charge
calculation scheme (EEM scheme) of Mortieret al.63 The calcula-
tion of long-range electrostatic interactions ( e.g., via Ewald
summation) is eliminated by the use of a seventh-order taper
function within a cutoﬀ distance. All other non-bonded inter-
actions (short-range Pauli repulsion and long-range dispersion)
are included in the EvdWaals term. A detailed description of
the individual terms can be found in the original paper of
van Duinet al.50
The ReaxFF parameters for the Cu(acac) 2 system considered
in the present study have been determined by ab initiocalcula-
tions performed in previous investigations. 64 The Cu/O/H para-
meters were integrated into the glycine force field 65 by following
the suggestions of Huang et al.66 These force fields use the same
O/H parameters and potential functions, making such inte-
gration relatively straightforward.66 The Cu/C bond parameters were
not optimized since such bonds were not expected to form, while
the non-bonded interactions were obtained from standard combi-
nation rules. The RMD simulations are performed in theNVT
canonical ensemble (constant number, volume and temperature).
A Nose–Hoover thermostat with a damping constant of 100 fs
was used for temperature control. The time step used in RMD
simulations was 0.1 fs for the reaction between Cu(acac) 2 and
O3 and 0.25 fs for the other systems, respectively. Such small
time steps are required to capture bond breaking and forming
involved in chemical reactions, so that converged results for
species evolution can be obtained. The initial system was firstly
equilibrated using a low-temperature (at 1 K) MD. After the
equilibrium, the system temperature was further increased from
1 K to 600 K within 20 ps at a uniform rate. Finally, reactiveNVT-
MD simulations were performed at 600 K for a total simulation
time of up to 1 ns. We slightly increase the temperature to
accelerate the chemical reaction.
Fig. 1 shows the calculated atomic structure of the Cu(acac) 2
precursor. The predicted and experimental bond lengths and
bond angles are listed in Table 1. A good agreement is observed
between theoretical and experimental results.67 The only excep-
tion is that ReaxFF predicts slightly larger C1–O bond length
(0.16 Å) and Cu–O–C1 angle (4.8 1) values. A more systematic
comparison of the results from DFT and ReaxFF is shown in the
next section. In DFT calculations, the Cu(110) surface was
modeled using a p(4/C24) supercell with periodic four-layer
slab models. In the case of RMD simulations, larger surface
models consisting of a four-layer slab for p(22/C230)-Cu(110)
(79.52 /C276.68 Å2), and a nine-layer slab for p(12 /C216)-Cu2O(111)
(72.46 /C283.67 Å2)a n df o rp ( 1 4/C212)-CuO(111) (80.76/C273.70 Å2)
were employed, respectively. To simplify our models, only stoichio-
metric surfaces were considered for Cu 2O(111) and CuO(111).
During the simulations, the bottom two layers of Cu(110), and
four layers of Cu2O(111) and CuO(111) were fixed, respectively. To
investigate the surface reaction between Cu(acac) 2 and different
co-reactants, 24 Cu(acac) 2 precursors were initially placed on

Above the adsorbed Cu(acac) 2, 2000 H 2O molecules or H atoms,
or 1000 O 3 molecules were distributed randomly, with a density
of 0.08 g cm /C03, 0.004 g cm /C03, and 0.1 g cm /C03, respectively. We
used a relatively high density of co-reactants to ensure suffi-
cient reactivity of the system and hence to obtain results within
a reasonable calculation time.
Results and discussion
Adsorption and dissociation of Cu(acac) 2 on the surface
In the first part of our study on copper precursors we analyze
the surface adsorption and succeeding dissociation of the pre-
cursors on various surfaces. The adsorption of Cu(acac)2 on Cu
is studied in detail before we compare these findings to those
on other surfaces. On the Cu(110) surface we consider four
diﬀerent adsorption sites: top (T), hollow (H), bridge1 (B1) and
bridge2 (B2) (see Fig. 2a). For each position, diﬀerent adsorp-
tion orientations of species were examined. The calculated
adsorption energies and structures of Cu(acac)2 and its disso-
ciation products are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 2. As
depicted in Fig. 2b–d, three stable configurations have been
obtained for the adsorption of Cu(acac)2. On the top and
bridge1 sites, Cu(acac) 2 prefers to adsorb on Cu(110) with a
parallel orientation (Fig. 2b and c). Geometric parameters of the
adsorbed Cu(acac) 2 are barely changed relative to a gaseous
molecule (not shown here). The adsorption energies computed
by using the PBE functional are/C00.48 eV for top and /C00.33 eV
for bridge2, respectively (Table 2). It is well known that the pure
GGA-PBE does not capture van der Waals forces (dispersion
forces), leading to an underestimated binding energy.56 Indeed,
the vdW-DF functional predicts much higher adsorption energies
(/C01.42 eV and /C01.34 eV), indicating that the vdW forces are the
dominant interactions. One the other hand, Cu(acac)2 is found to
strongly chemisorb on the hollow site with a binding energy of
/C01.51 eV for PBE (Table 2). The energy calculated using vdW-DF
is 0.65 eV larger than that using PBE, because of the contribution
of vdW forces between the acac-ligands and the surface. The
Cu(acac)2 molecule is significantly distorted from planarity to
enhance adsorption (Fig. 2d). Four Cu–O bonds are formed
between the surface Cu atoms and O of Cu(acac) 2,w i t hab o n d
length of 2.07 Å. However, bond length of the original Cu–O bond
of Cu(acac)2 is increased from 1.95 Å (in the gas-phase) to 2.21 Å
(on the surface), which weakens the Cu–O bond strength. In
contrast to Cu(acac) 2 both Cu(acac) and acac prefer to adsorb
with the molecular axis being perpendicular to the Cu surface
normal (Fig. 2f and g). The most stable adsorption sites are the
hollow (Eads = /C02.16 eV for PBE) and top ( Eads = /C02.68 eV for PBE)
sites, respectively (Table 2). The Cu atom prefers to adsorb on the
hollow site, with a binding energy of/C03.08 eV for the PBE
functional. The vdW forces have no significant influence on the
adsorption energy of Cu(acac), acac, and Cu species, suggesting
that chemisorption is the dominant interaction.
In order to demonstrate the validity of our model calcula-
tions we have also performed vibrational frequency calculations
and compared it with experimental findings.68 The perpendicular
adsorption geometries of Cu(acac) and acac have been confirmed
Fig. 2 Adsorption sites (a) and optimized geometries of diﬀerent adsorbed species (b–g) on the Cu(110) surface calculated using the DFT-PBE
functional. The adsorption geometries calculated using vdW-DF and ReaxFF are similar to that calculated using DFT-PBE and are thus not shown here.

by vibrational spectroscopy studies. As shown in Table 3, the
key vibrational frequencies of adsorbed Cu(acac) and acac
match well with that of gaseous Cu(acac)2, indicating that the
surface acac-ligand maintains the same geometric configuration
as the gaseous Cu(acac)2.68,69 In contrast, frequency of the
CO stretch of adsorbed Cu(acac) 2 is shifted from 1556 cm /C01
to 1507 cm /C01 relative to gaseous Cu(acac) 2. This is consistent
with a parallel adsorption geometry causing a distorted mole-
cular structure on the surface.
Table 2 also shows the comparison of adsorption energies
and bond lengths between ReaxFF and as obtained from
DFT. Since no benchmark data are currently available for the
Cu(acac)2/Cu(110) system, we thus use the vdW-DF results as
a reference to evaluate the accuracy of ReaxFF. Recent DFT
calculations for a Cu(dmap)2/Cu(111) (dmap = dimethylamino-
2-propoxide) system have found that the vdW interactions not
only increase the adsorption energies but also change the
nature of the adsorption fundamentally. 46 It can be seen from
Table 2 that most of the ReaxFF results match well with the DFT
results. The average energetic discrepancies with respect to the
vdW-DF are/C60.22 eV (8.9%) and /C60.18 Å (6.9%), respectively.
The only exception is that ReaxFF fails to predict the structure
for Cu(acac)2 adsorption on the hollow site. A large distance
between Cu and O atoms (2.88 Å) is associated with the dissocia-
tive adsorption of Cu(acac)2 on the surface.
After the preferred adsorption geometries for diﬀerent species
were determined, the minimum energy pathway for Cu(acac) 2
dissociation on the Cu surface was mapped out using the CI-NEB
method, which is depicted in Fig. 3 and 4. The clean Cu(110)
surface with a gaseous precursor is selected as the reference state,
while Cu with co-adsorbed acac-ligands on the surface is set
as the final state. In general, the decomposition of Cu(acac)2
on Cu(110) is an exothermic process. The calculated reaction
energies for the whole process are/C02.10 eV with PBE and /C02.61 eV
with vdW-DF, respectively. Cu(acac) 2 can easily diﬀuse from the
top or bridge1 site to the nearby lowest energy hollow site, with
no appreciable energy barrier (o0.1 eV). The dissociation of
one acac-ligand from adsorbed Cu(acac) 2 requires to overcome

Only the key vibrational frequencies are shown. The frequencies of acac/Cu(001) are very similar to that of acac/Cu(110), indicating that the

energy barriers of 0.59 eV for PBE and 0.48 eV for vdW-DF,
respectively. At the transition state, the acac-ligand is located
above a hollow site, with two oxygen atoms bound to the adjacent
surface Cu atoms (Fig. 4). Reaction barrier for the decomposition
of Cu(acac) into Cu + acac is similar to that of Cu(acac)2,w i t h
0.56 eV for PBE and 0.50 eV for vdW-DF, respectively. Again, the
acac-ligand at the transition state is positioned above the hollow
site. The population analysis shown in Fig. 4 suggests that adsorp-
tion of Cu(acac)2 and its further dissociation into Cu(acac)
and Cu would lead to sequential reduction of the Cu center
(1.19e - 0.86e - 0.69e - 0.44e - 0.08e). A zero-valence
metallic Cu atom is formed finally. On the other hand, the
acac-ligand of Cu(acac)2 is firstly reduced upon adsorption
(/C00.60e - /C00.83e) and is then oxidized upon dissociation
(/C00.83e - /C00.66e). Charge of the acac-ligand in the final state
(/C00.66e) is similar to that in the reference state ( /C00.60e),
suggesting that the metallic substrate is responsible for the
reduction of the Cu center of Cu(acac)2. In short, our DFT
calculations reveal a sequential dissociation and reduction
[Cu(acac)2 - Cu(acac) - Cu] of the Cu precursor on the
Cu(110) surface, which is in accordance with previous XPS
investigations.29
In principle, the ligands are used to volatilize the metal atoms.
Thus the ligands are expected to remain intact upon adsorption
and will be removed by the co-reactant (e.g. hydrogen or oxygen)
during the subsequent ALD half cycle.28 Table 4 lists the DFT-PBE
calculated reaction energies for the further decomposition of the
acac-ligand. The large positive energies reveal that the further
decomposition of the acac-ligand on a Cu(110) surface is
unfavorable. Thus, the stable acac-ligand may block surface sites
and prevents the adsorption of further Cu precursor molecules,
and therefore the deposition is self-limited.
The RMD simulation snapshots of the Cu(acac) 2 decomposi-
tion on the Cu(110) surface at 600 K are shown in Fig. 5. In
general, the reaction pathways observed in RMD simulations are
consistent with those from the DFT calculations. The reaction
starts by breaking of the Cu–O bond and the tilt of the acac-
ligand (7.3 ps). Next, the acac-ligand dissociates completely from
the Cu(acac)2 molecule, forming acac and Cu(acac) species on
the surface (10.8 ps). Finally, Cu(acac) dissociates into Cu and
acac species on the surface after 18.5 ps. Experimentally, the
complete decomposition of Cu(acac)2 to metallic Cu on the
surface is reported to occur at around 300 K. 29 Such a low reac-
tion temperature suggests a high reactivity of the Cu surface
towards Cu(acac)2, which is consistent with the small activation
energy calculated by DFT. In addition, a facile reaction process is
also compatible with the time scale of the RMD simulations.
Fig. 6 shows the comparison for Cu(acac) 2 dissociation into
Cu(acac) and acac on Cu(110), Cu2O(111), and CuO(111) surfaces.
Initially, 24 Cu(acac) 2 precursors were placed above the surface.
The pathways of Cu(acac) 2 dissociation on various substrates are
similar, and are thus not shown here. As illustrated in Fig. 6,
the Cu(acac)2 molecules are completely decomposed afterB70 ps
at 600 K. The reaction on copper-rich surfaces [Cu(110) and
Cu2O(111)] is faster as compared with that on CuO(111), indicat-

Surface reaction between Cu(acac) 2 and diﬀerent co-reactants
In order to complement the picture of the surface reactions of
Cu(acac)2 on various surfaces we analyze the role of diﬀerent
co-reactants which are typically used throughout ALD-processes.
First, the reaction with molecular hydrogen is studied. Our RMD
investigations reveal that molecular H2 hardly reacts with
Cu(acac)2 on the surface at 600 K. Instead, the molecules are
found to assemble around the precursor, having weak attractive
but nonbonded interactions with the structure. Therefore, we do
not consider H 2 molecules in our further studies. Indeed, mole-
cular H2 is rarely employed as a co-reactant for Cu b-diketonates.21
Alternatively, a plasma-enhanced ALD process 20,21 or a strong
reducing agent8,23 is required to deposit the Cu thin films directly.

We now discuss the surface reaction between Cu(acac) 2 and
atomic H on Cu(110), as a model system for plasma enhanced
Cu ALD. The corresponding typical RMD snapshots are shown
in Fig. 7. The influence of other plasma-generated components
(e.g., charged particles, electric fields, and heat) 22 is not con-
sidered in our simulation. In contrast to the molecular species,
atomic hydrogen is found to be very reactive towards the Cu
precursor. Cu(acac)2 breaks the Cu–O bonds upon hydrogen
impact, and a H 2(acac) molecule is formed and released to the
gas-phase (14.6 ps). Next, an oxygen atom in H 2(acac) is
abstracted by the hydrogen and a water molecule is released
(15.2 ps). The remaining fragment is dissociated further into
ethane and acetone (20.3 ps). Finally, a methane molecule is
produced (22.4 ps). The time evolution of the species in the gas-
phase during the RMD simulations is shown in Fig. 8a. The
formation of HxO species starts slightly earlier ( B10 ps) than
that of C xHy species, indicating that the atomic hydrogen reacts
first with the oxygen of the Cu pre cursor. The system achieves the
equilibrium after about 150 ps, in which the atomic hydrogen is
consumed completely by the formation of H 2,C xHy and H xO
species. Due to the re-adsorption of H xO species the amounts of
surface H and O are slightly increased after B80 ps. The H xO
species exist mainly as H2Oo nt h es u r f a c es i n c et h eo b s e r v e dH / O
ratio is equal to B2 (Fig. 8b). In contrast to the H and O containing
species most of the C atoms are released to the gas-phase.
In the next part of this section we analyze the surface reactions
between Cu(acac)2 and H2O, as shown in Fig. 9. We use Cu 2O(111)
as the substrate since Cu b-diketonates with H2O primarily deposit
cuprous oxide films at low temperatures.9,70,71Previous reports72,73
have shown that water facilitates the deposition of Cu 2Ot h r o u g h
the following ligand-exchange reaction
Cu(acac) + H 2O - CuOH + H(acac)
Our RMD simulations predict the following reaction scheme
which is consistent with previous findings. Firstly, Cu(acac) 2
dissociates into Cu(acac) and acac on the surface after B25 ps
of simulation. Secondly, a proton is transferred from water to
the adsorbed Cu(acac), forming Cu[H(acac)] and OH species on
the surface (56.8 ps). Finally, the Cu–O bond of the Cu[H(acac)]
intermediate is then broken after 118.6 ps, which leads to the
desorption of acetylacetone from the surface to the gas-phase. A
similar ligand-exchange mechanism has been widely observed
in water-based metal oxide ALD, for example, in the TMA–H 2O
(TMA = trimethylaluminum) or Hf(NMe 2)4–H2O (Me = CH 3)
process.5,45 During the water pulse, the adsorbed Me- or NMe 2-
ligands are replaced by –OH groups, followed by the elimination
of gaseous CH4 or HNMe 2.5,45 It is noticed that cleavage of the
Cu–O bond of Cu(acac)2 in the presence of atomic H is promoted
upon H impact, whereas with water the proton transition takes
place after Cu(acac)2 is completely dissociated on the surface.
These observations suggest that water is much less reactive
compared to the atomic H. As shown in Fig. 8c, it can be found
that H(acac) is the main gaseous product during this reaction,
while the amounts of acac and H2(acac) are minor. The surface
reaction between H 2O and the acac-ligand reaches stationary
equilibrium after about 400 ps, in which about 35–40% of the
acac-ligands are released to the gas-phase.
Typical RMD snapshots for the surface reactions between
Cu(acac)2 and O 3 are shown in Fig. 10 and 11. The CuO(111)
surface is used in these simulations, which is in line with the
experimental observation that CuO is deposited by a Cu(acac)2–
O3 ALD process. 11 As depicted in Fig. 10, the ozone molecule is
found to bind readily with the methyl group through a hydro-
gen bond, forming an O–H bond with a length ofB1.9 Å
(Fig. 10a). One H atom of the acac-ligand is then abstracted by
the ozone, as a result of the OH and O2 formation (16.8 ps). The
released OH radical either re-adsorbs on the surface or reacts
with methyl hydrogen to produce H 2O (99.4 ps). Moreover, we
observed that the O atom can insert into the C–H bond of the
–CH3 group, which involves the formation of O 2 and –CH 2OH
species (94.3 ps). A similar insertion step has been reported to
occur in the TMA–O3 ALD process, proven by infrared spectro-
scopy and DFT calculations. 47,74,75 In comparison to the hydro-
gen abstraction, the C–C cleavage usually takes place later. As
shown in Fig. 11a–c, an oxygen atom firstly adsorbs above the
bridging C–C site to form an epoxide (92.2 ps). The C–C bond is
then cleaved by the O atom throughan epoxy-ether transformation
(93.2 ps). At the same time, the acac-ligand breaks the bond with
t h es u r f a c eC ua n di st h u sr e l e a s e dto the gas-phase. Subsequently,
the formed complex dissociates in to the gaseous methylglyoxal,

methylglyoxal and ethenone species are further oxidized into
CO, CO2 and OH after about 80 ps of simulation (not shown
here). Fig. 11d–h illustrate the alternative reaction pathways for
C–C cleavage. Upon continuous adsorption of two O atoms, the
acac-ligand dissociates into gaseous methylglyoxal and adsorbed
acetate. The formed acetate is readily desorbed from the surface

and dissociates into CO 2 and CH 3. From the time evolution of
species shown in Fig. 8e, it is found that most of the O 3 is
converted into O2 after B180 ps upon either a surface reaction or
self-dissociation in the gas-phase. The H xOy and COx species are
found to be the main by-products, suggesting a combustion-like
reaction mechanism. This observation is consistent with previous
in situmass spectroscopy studies for a Ir(acac)3–O3 ALD process.37
We have found that the evolution of H xOy is about B10 ps earlier
than that of CO x species, revealing that ozone reacts first with the
hydrogen of the Cu precursor. C oncentrations of the H species
in the gas-phase increase firstly and decrease after 80 ps. At the
equilibrium state, about 70% of the surface C impurities are
released to the gas-phase, whereas the amount of surface O
increases significantly after the O 3 pulse (Fig. 8f). Most of the
gaseous H xOy are re-adsorbed on the surface, thus protons are
available for the ligand-exchange reaction during the Cu(acac) 2
pulse, as in the case of the Cu(acac) 2–H2O process.
By comparison with the reaction rate and the carbon removal
ratio under diﬀerent conditions, it can be concluded that the
reactivity of the co-reactants towards Cu(acac)2 follows the order
H 4 O3 4 H2O. In experiment, it is well known that reactivity of
the co-reactant has a large eﬀect on an ALD temperature window.
The lower bound of the ALD window is mainly determined by the
thermal activation of a surface reaction as well as by the volatility
of the precursor.5 Therefore, the ALD window could be used as
an indicator to evaluate the reactivity between Cu(acac) 2 and
diﬀerent co-reactants. A lower ALD window is associated with the
higher reactivity of the co-reactant. As reported in the literature,
when the H plasma is used for Cu(acac)2, the ALD window is as
low as 85–135 1C.21 However, much higher temperatures are
required when ozone (150–230 1C)11 or water (210–300 1C)76 is
used as the co-reactant. These results may suggest that the
plasma H is more reactive towards Cu(acac)2 as compared to
ozone and water, which is consistent with our conclusion.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the initial surface reactions of the Cu(acac) 2 pre-
cursor during ALD were studied through DFT calculations and
RMD simulations. The Cu(acac)2, Cu(acac) and Cu species prefer to
adsorb on a hollow site, whereas the acac-ligand favors adsorption
on the top site of the Cu(110) surface. The adsorption energies
calculated by ReaxFF agree well with those calculated by vdW-DF.
Cu(acac)2 is easily decomposed into a Cu atom and acac-ligands on
the Cu(110) surface. The largest reaction barriers calculated using
PBE and vdW-DF functionals are 0.59 eV and 0.55 eV, respectively.
Mulliken analysis reveals a sequential reduction of the Cu atom
during the dissociation of Cu(acac)2 on Cu(110). The dissociated
acac-ligands may act as site blockers for additional adsorption of
the precursors, since they are thermodynamically stable on the sur-
face. The RMD simulations imply that the decomposition pathways
of Cu(acac)2 on various substrates are similar, but the copper-rich
surfaces [Cu(110) and Cu 2O(111)] are more reactive as compared
with the CuO(111) surface. Mecha nisms for the surface reaction
between Cu(acac)2 and diﬀerent co-reactants are also examined.
The molecular hydrogen is found to be nonreactive towards the Cu
precursor; whereas atomic H or water can remove the surface acac-
ligands eﬃciently. The H atoms continuously impact with the Cu
precursor, which lead to the breaking of Cu–O, C–O, and C–C
bonds sequentially. On the other hand, water reacts with the
Cu(acac)2 on Cu 2O(111) through a ligand-exchange reaction, pro-
ducing the gaseous H(acac) and surface OH species. A combustion
reaction with CO 2 and H 2O as the main byproducts is observed
when adsorbed Cu(acac)2 reacts with ozone. Once equilibrium is
reached, most of the gaseous HxOy are re-adsorbed on the surface.
Thus protons are available for the next ALD half cycle.
