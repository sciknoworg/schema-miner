The selective encapsulation of noble metal catalysts is a newly developed method to maintain their
durability and reactivity. In our work, we have found that AlO x can preferentially encapsulate Pt
nanoparticle facets with dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) as an ALD precursor. The selectivity
originates from the preferential DMAI decomposition mechanism on double hydroxyl sites of the Pt (111)
facet, with the subsequent H2O half cycle rapidly removing residual surface intermediates and
regenerating the hydroxyls as reaction sites for subsequent cycles. Related microkinetic and
experimental results conﬁrm that by the substitution of one methyl in trimethylaluminum (TMA) with an
isopropanol radical, DMAI as the precursor can preferentially coat the Pt (111) facets and leave other sites
intact through controlling the ALD deposition parameters. The substituent eﬀect in DMAI is also
discussed in detail to give guidance to ALD precursor design. Combining theoretical and experimental
studies, our work provides for theﬁrst time a feasible strategy to achieve selective decoration of AlOx on
Pt nanoparticlesvia ALD.
1 Introduction
Pt catalysts have extensive applications in energy conversion
and environmental purication due to their excellent catalytic
performance in the oxygen reduction reaction as well as diesel
exhaust and VOC elimination.1–7 However, the formation of
larger Pt nanoparticles (NPs) when operated at high tempera-
tures causes loss of the active surface area and sites of the
catalyst.8–11 Chemical anchoring by strong metal –support
interfacial interactions and physical barriers via oxide over-
coating are utilized to maintain the stability of Pt nanoparticles
under harsh conditions.9,12,13 Notably, atomic layer deposition
(ALD) is considered an eﬀective physical encapsulating strategy
due to its precise control of thickness on the atomic scale. It has
been reported that coating porous layers of Al2O3, ZnO, ZrO2
and CeO2 on metal NPsvia ALD can be used to stabilize the NPs
and to hinder diﬀusion and agglomeration.14–18 The elaborately
constructed composite structure demonstrates outstanding
resistance towards sintering in comparison to its bare coun-
terpart upon thermal aging. However, uniform porous protec-
tive layers block surface sites and suppress the access of
reactants to the active components, which causes loss of reac-
tivity and increased light-oﬀ temperature.19,20
To address this issue, the selective encapsulation method
has been proposed by controllably depositing oxides at desired
sites of Pt NPsvia ALD. It is found that the reactive 3d-transition
metal oxides are quite eﬀective decorations for low-coordinated
Pt sites. For example, Qinet al.revealed that low-coordinated Pt
sites can be precisely blocked by Fe oxides via ALD; this
generates Pt–FeOx interfacial perimeter sites and enhances the
selectivity of selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. 21
Furthermore, combining theoretical and experimental studies,
our group proposed edge-selective growth mechanisms with
cyclopentadienyl precursors (MCp2,M ¼ Fe, Co, and Ni); this
method exhibits robust preferential growth on edge sites due to
a more favorable splitting path of the precursors.11 It is plau-
sible that the site preference can be ascribed to low coordina-
tion numbers of the edge sites; in turn, preferential terrace
encapsulation appears to be more diﬃcult. Researchers have
also devoted eﬀorts to achieving preferential coating of terrace
sites on Pt NPs. It was recently demonstrated that Ce(thd)4 as
a Ce precursor enables the precise deposition of CeOx on Pt
(111) facets while leaving Pt (100) facets exposed.10 This fact
again conrms the superiority of transition metal oxides for

selective coating of Pt NPs. On the other hand, inert oxide
encapsulation is equally important because it can passivate
undesired sites to tailor the intrinsic selectivity and stability of
catalysts for numerous reactions.8,19 Note that Al2O3 is one of
the most used widely oxides for ALD inert encapsulation.22–24
Using the popular trimethylaluminum (TMA) as a precursor of
Al2O3, Peter C. Stair and co-workers found that Al2O3 merely
preferentially nucleates at low-coordinated sites of Pd NPs and
leaves the Pd (111) facets free.25,26 To our best knowledge,
preferential decoration of inert Al2O3 on Pt facets has not been
realized to date.27 It is highly desirable to achieve selective Al2O3
growth on Pt terrace sites.
In this work, based on theoretical and experimental studies,
we demonstrate that by using dimethylaluminum isopropoxide
(DMAI) as the new Al2O3 precursor, we can achieve the prefer-
ential encapsulation of Pt (111). The DMAI adsorption and
decomposition mechanisms on hydroxylated Pt (111), (100) and
edge sites are proposed and compared. It is found that double
hydroxyls at the facets are the primary active sites, and the
existence of H2O in the reaction can eﬀectively remove residual
intermediates at the Pt sites. Furthermore, our microkinetic
analysis and experimental evidence show that AlOx can prefer-
entially encapsulate Pt (111) while keeping other facets exposed
as potential reaction sites through properly tuning the ALD
cycles. Furthermore, the substituent eﬀects on DMAI are dis-
cussed. Our work opens a new avenue for tuning the properties
of Pt nanoparticlesvia area-selective ALD for numerous chem-
ical reactions.
2 Computational methods
2.1 Density functional theory calculation set
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations28,29 were performed
with VASP code.30–32 The exchange and correlation energies are
in the form of generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and
the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and projector augmented
wave (PAW) methods were used to depict the electron –ion
interactions.33 A cutoﬀ energy of 400 eV and Monkhorst–Pack k-
meshes of 3/C2 3 /C2 1 were set for the surface calculations. The
structure was optimized until the Hellmann–Feynman force
was smaller than 0.05 eV ˚A/C0 1. The climbing-image nudged
elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to search the transition
states of the elementary steps, with six intermediate images
between the initial andnal states. On the basis of our previous
study,11 we utilized the low-index facets (111) and (100) to
imitate the terraces of Pt NPs, and the joints of the two facets
were constructed as low-coordinated edge sites, as shown in
Fig. 1a. 4/C2 4 /C2 1 supercells with ve atomic layers were
necessary for the low-index (111) and (100) facets in view of the
long fragments of DMAI. A 13.78˚A /C2 14.06 ˚A rectangular cell
with eight atomic layers was built for the edge conguration.
These corresponding facet models are shown in Fig. S1.† The
top three layers of these models were allowed to relax during
structure optimizing and energy calculation. A vacuum layer of
at least 15˚A was appended to eliminate the image cell inter-
actions along the direction perpendicular to the surface. Note
that the coordination numbers of Pt atom on the edge, (100),
and (111) sites are 7, 8, and 9, respectively.11 Comparative
gures of the structures of the Al2O3 precursors (TMA and
DMAI) are shown in Fig. 1b. One aluminum atom binds with
three methyl groups and exhibits a planar conguration in
TMA. Compared with TMA, the isopropanol radical (C2H7O)
replaces one methyl in DMAI, which creates a larger fragment
and asymmetric conguration. Structure diﬀerences between
two precursors imply diﬀerences in their activity and selectivity.

2.2 Experimental section
AlOx deposition experiments were carried out with diﬀerent
reaction cycles on Pt nanoparticle facetsvia ALD. Note that the
Pt nanoparticles wererstly supported on CeO2 supports via the
ALD method,34 and all Pt/CeO2 samples in our work were
prepared with two Pt ALD cycles. The particle sizes and distri-
bution of the Pt nanoparticles at the CeO2 nanospheres (NS) are
shown in Fig. S2.† Uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles at
the CeO2 nanospheres was found, and the average Pt particle
size is about 2.30/C6 0.36 nm. The ALD processes for the surface
coating of the nanoparticles were performed in a homemade
ALD reactor with auidized bed. When no precursor is intro-
duced, the base pressure of the reactor is about 1.2 Torr. About
200 mg sample can be loaded into the designed powder holder,
and the top and bottom are sealed by a stainless steel screen.
Considering the poor volatility of DMAI at room temperature,
the precursor DMAI is heated and maintained at 60/C14 C during
the deposition. In contrast, due to the good volatility of TMA,
the stainless steel bubbler of TMA is maintained at room
temperature. An integrated AlOx cycle consists of 90 s pulse
times of both H2O and the AlOx precursor (DMAI or TMA) and
N2 purge times of 120 s between the two precursors at the
deposition temperature of 120/C14 C. Diﬀerent from the popular
precursor of TMA in typical Al2O3 ALD, the nonpyrophoric
DMAI precursor can avoid the hazards induced by the pyro-
phoric nature of TMA.35,36 The partial pressures of DMAI and
H2O are 40 and 30 Pa, respectively.

We combined high resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) with in situ diﬀuse reectance infrared
Fourier transform (in situ DRIFT) experiments to conrm the
selective encapsulation on the Pt NPs. Regardingin situDRIFT,
CO adsorbed on diﬀerent facets possesses diﬀerent locations of
adsorption peaks in the linear CO adsorption spectra; these
peak areas indicate the amount of available sites for CO
adsorption and also represent the amount of vacant surface
sites aer a certain number of AlOx ALD cycles. In situ DRIFT
was performed on a Thermo Scientic Nicolet iS50 spectrom-
eter equipped with a MCT detector and a reaction cell (PIKE
Technologies)tted with a ZnSe window. The DRIFT spectra
were recorded in the range of 650–4000 cm/C0 1 with a resolution
of 4 cm/C0 1 and accumulation of 32 scans. All the samples were
rst pre-treated in an atmosphere of 20% O2 balanced by N2 at
300 /C14 C for 30 min to remove possible organic species in the ALD
process; then, the temperature was cooled to 30/C14 C. The back-
ground spectra were collected in aow of 50 sccm of N2 at 30/C14 C.
CO adsorption spectra were collected aer treatment with 50
sccm of 1% CO. Aer the spectra were stable, aow of 50 sccm
of N2 was used to remove physically adsorbed CO, and the CO
chemical adsorption spectra could be obtained.
2.3 Microkinetic model of DMAI decomposition
A schematic of the Al2O3 ALD process is plotted in Fig. 2. It
mainly involves two half cycles: the H2O half cycle for surface
hydroxylation and the Al-containing precursor half cycle for
AlOx formation. According to the initial chemical environment,
we can divide the ALD process into two stages: nucleation and
linear growth.11 In the nucleation stage, only the hydroxyls exist
at the surface, and DMAI binds with the hydroxyls and further
decomposes. This process mainly occurs in the early stage of
ALD. Aer that, the surface is saturated by the AlOx species,
where DMAI further adsorbs and decomposes to form the AlOx
thin lm; this is generally referred to as the linear growth stage.
In reality, the nucleation stage plays the crucial role in the
intrinsic selective AlOx growth at the Pt facets;11 thus, we focus
on the adsorption and decomposition of the precursor on
diﬀerent Pt facets in the nucleation stage in this work.
To quantitatively evaluate the deposition rates of AlOx on
diﬀerent facets, a microkinetic model is essential to gain
insight into the DMAI adsorption and dissociation behaviors
under relevant experimental conditions. In the model, the
decomposition of DMAI mainly involves the adsorption and
dissociative reaction processes. The rate constant (ki)o ft h e
adsorption process was obtained by applying the collision
theory37 in eqn (2). Note thatS as the sticking coeﬃcient is
assumed as unity for all adsorbed species. s is the average
area of an active site and was set as the areas of the models in
our calculation. The other parameters are molecular mass
(mA), Boltzmann constant (kB) and reaction temperature (T),
respectively. Otherwise, the rate constants (ki)o ft h es u r f a c e
reaction steps were obtained from transition state theory38 as
shown in eqn (3), andDEi is a DFT-calculated surface reaction
barrier. As we know, a normal microkinetic model of a cata-
lytic reaction network requires that the reaction sites be
recovered aer an integrated reaction cycle because of the
nature of the catalytic process.39 However, in the deposition
process of ALD, the available sites for precursor decomposi-
tion gradually reduce until all are covered by targeted AlOx
species as the process proceeds. Thus, we introduced
a parameter to describe the amount of AlOx species to
simulate the realistic situation. The details are shown in
Section 3.4.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Hydroxylated sites on Pt facets
In the typical ALD process, the existence of H2O precursor can
hydroxylate the surface atoms to create favorable precursor
adsorption and dissociation sites.25,40,41 Under realistic atmo-
spheric conditions, H 2O dissociation is observed to form
adsorbed hydroxyl species due to the presence of adsorbed
atomic oxygen at the Pt slabs.42–44 Thus, hydroxylated Pt facets
were chosen as the surface model for DMAI decomposition in
our research. We give the variation of the relative energies about
the distance of two hydroxyls to gain insight into the interac-
tions between the hydroxyls in Fig. 3. At Pt (111), we cannd
that energy uctuation under 0.1 eV occurs for hydroxyls with
diﬀerent distances, which demonstrates the weak interactions
between the hydroxyls. It was also found that the top and bridge
adsorption sites on Pt (111) have similar stability. Three
diﬀerent binding congurations, namely top–top (t–t), top–
bridge (t–b) and bridge–bridge (b–b), as reasonable represen-
tations of hydroxyls binding on Pt (100) and edge facets, are
shown in Fig. 3b and c. It was found that the stability of these
structures follows the order b–b>t –b>t –t due to the stronger
bridge binding. Note that the nearest double hydroxyl binding
is energetically unfavorable compared with the other b –
b binding because of the shared Pt atoms. Except for this
outlier, there is no appreciable change of binding strength with
distance, indicating negligible interaction between hydroxyls.

3.2 DMAI decomposition on Pt facets
Due to the existence of 4 and 6-coordinated Al atoms in bulk
Al2O3, we primarily considered the isolated and double hydroxyl
models as the reaction sites. In addition, the surface model with
more hydroxyl groups is unfavorable for the adsorption of
planar Al precursors (DMAI and TMA). Considering that the
neighboring distance of oxygen atoms is around 2.4–3.2 ˚A and
the bond length of Al–O is about 1.7–2.1 ˚A in bulk Al2O3, the
double hydroxyls must be within a distance of 3.5–4.0 ˚A for
eﬀective binding with Al atoms in DMAI and TMA. A decom-
position path of DMAI on Pt slabs with double hydroxyls is
shown in Scheme 1 and Fig. 4. In this model, two hydroxyls on
the slab capture one DMAI as the initial state of further reac-
tions in elementary step 1 (ES1). Previous experimental work
indicates that methane and isopropanol are the main products
of DMAI decompositionvia Al–C and Al–O scission, respec-
tively;35,45–47 thus, two kinds of dissociation pathways may occur.
One involves breaking the bonds between Al and O of iso-
propanol radical to form an isopropanol along ES2 and then
produce a methane molecule aer the breakage of the Al–C
bond along ES3. Another pathwayrstly produces a methane
molecule via splitting of the Al–C bond in ES4 and subsequently
releases an isopropanol and a methane molecule along ES5 and
ES6, respectively. Apparently, two H atoms of hydroxyls can only
assist the formation of two molecules, and the residual methyl
or isopropanol radical is removed by the H2O in the next ALD
cycle. The corresponding energetics of DMAI decomposition on
the Pt (111), (100) and edge sites are shown in Fig. 5.
Pt (111).Based on the discussion above, on the Pt (111) facet,
our research focuses on the conguration of the two hydroxyls
within the distance of 3.5˚A in Fig. 3a. Herein, werstly chose
the 1st conguration with the top and the most neighboring
bridge binding as the initial state of DMAI adsorption. The
reaction diagrams of DMAI dissociation are shown in Fig. 5a.
We can see that a DMAI molecule binds with two hydroxylsvia
overcoming a low adsorption barrier of 0.18 eV, where the iso-
propanol radical locates atop the bridge-binding hydroxyls. The
distance of 1.82˚A between H of the hydroxyl and O of the iso-
propanol radical and the angle between H of the hydroxyl and O
of the isopropanol radical imply the existence of a hydrogen
bond, which may be conducive to Al–O cleavage. Regarding the
two diﬀerent subsequent dissociation pathways, we cannd
that the formation of isopropanol via ES2 is easier than
producing a methane in ES4 due to the lower barrier of Al–O
bond breakage (0.28 eV) than of Al–C scission (0.64 eV). The two
radicals of the residual intermediates are located on two sides of
the Al atoms. Specically, aer releasing a methane molecule in
ES4, migration of oxygen atoms bonded to the Pt slab leads to
a structural reconstruction. The further dissociation of residual
precursors along ES3, ES5 and ES6 were also studied, and the
related structures of the intermediates are shown in Fig. S3.† A
reaction barrier of 1.20 eV occurs for the production of
CH3AlO2* in ES3, while a higher barrier of about 1.63 eV is
needed for the same purpose in ES5. In ES6, methane formation
possesses the same barrier as ES5. Herein, it is apparent that

the relative energies were calculated with the energy of a certain structure as energy zero (EZ), and the distance (dHO–OH) between double
hydroxyls was deﬁned as the distance between the oxygen atoms.

these second dissociation processes are more diﬃcult due to
higher barriers ($1.20 eV) than the rst dissociation of the
precursor (<0.65 eV). Moreover, we cannd that the formation
of reaction products in ES3, ES5 and ES6 is more endothermic
compared with therst dissociations of DMAI along ES2 and
ES4. Those results all illustrate that the second dissociation
processes are unfavorable to proceed not only kinetically but
also thermodynamically. Hence, decomposition of only one
subgroup in DMAI is likely to occur on Pt (111).
On the other hand, therst-step decomposition of DMAI in
the 2nd model with double top binding was also studied, as
shown in Fig. S4.† Similar to the case discussed above, the
formation of isopropanol has a low reaction barrier (0.29 eV)
due to its similar adsorption conguration. Likewise, methane
formation possesses a higher barrier (0.90 eV) than the iso-
propanol process. Generally speaking, Al–O scission is the
predominant pathway for DMAI decomposition on Pt (111)
facets.
Pt (100).On Pt (100), congurations with HO–OH distances
of around 3.5˚A were selected as possible reaction sites for DMAI
adsorption and dissociation. Firstly, the energetic diagram of
DMAI decomposition at the most stable b–b conguration is
shown in Fig. 5b. In Fig. 5b, one DMAI molecule adsorbs at the
hydroxyls with the energy barrier of 0.16 eV, where the methyl of
DMAI is located on top of a hydroxyl and the other radicals are
located on two sides of Al*(OH)2. Then, the removal of a methyl
in ES4 is easier than isopropanol formation because of the lower
energy barrier of Al–C breakage. Aer releasing a methane or
isopropanol, these congurations can be optimized as tetrahe-
dral structures. Similarly, the subsequent dissociation
processes of the residual precursors in ES3, ES5 and ES6
possess much higher energy barriers than the decomposition in
ES2 and ES4, which suggests that DMAI dissociation would
cease to proceed aer ES2 or ES4. The structures of the related
intermediates in the further decomposition processes are
shown in Fig. S5.† We further considered another DMAI
adsorption conguration, where the isopropanol radical is
located atop one hydroxyl and the other methyl species are on
the two sides of the Al(OH)2 radical, as shown in Fig. S6.† In the
adsorption process, the H atom of one hydroxyl binds with the
isopropanol; it exhibits a higher reaction barrier of about
0.87 eV, which indicates that it is more diﬃcult for DMAI to
bind with surface radicals through this structure. Furthermore,
this adsorption conguration leads to energetically unfavorable
isopropanol formation and slow methane formation.
Among other double hydroxyl congurations, b–b type with
shared Pt atoms exhibits a high DMAI adsorption barrier of
0.73 eV due to Pt–O bond scission, and the t–b conguration
shows high formation barriers of methane and isopropanol, as
shown in Fig. S7.† In a word, the symmetric b–b hydroxyl groups
in Fig. 5b show superior DMAI decomposition ability.
Pt edge. At the Pt edge sites, we compared the DMAI
adsorption and decomposition behaviors at the t–t, t–b and b–
b hydroxyl groups. We found that DMAI adsorption on the t–
b type structure shows a higher adsorption barrier (0.61 eV) than
that on t–t type (see Fig. S8a†) due to the change of the OH
binding type from t–bt ot–t type in the adsorption process. As for
the b–b type structure, the DMAI decompositions all show much
higher reaction barriers (>1.0 eV) (see Fig. S8b†). Thus, we
focused on DMAI adsorption and decomposition on the double
hydroxyls with the t–t structure at the Pt edge sites. The corre-
sponding energetic diagram is shown in Fig. 5c. It can be seen
that DMAI binds with two top-binding hydroxyls by overcoming
a barrier of 0.11 eV, and the isopropanol radical of DMAI locates
atop one hydroxyl. Then, the H atom migrates to form an iso-
propanol molecule with a barrier of about 0.71 eV in ES2. The
residual tetrahedral structure appears, and further dissociation
exhibits a higher energy barrier of about 1.01 eV in ES3. On the
other hand, compared with the decomposition along ES2,
methane formation in ES4 is more favorable through a 0.38 eV
barrier. Aer that, further dissociation along ES5 and ES6 is also
more diﬃcult in comparison with ES4. Structures of all the
intermediates in the further decomposition processes are shown
in Fig. S9.† It is concluded that the second dissociations along
ES3, ES4 and ES5 also proceed with diﬃculty at the Pt edge sites.
Furthermore, the adsorption and decomposition of DMAI on
the Pt facets with isolated hydroxyls were studied, as shown in
Fig. 5 The decomposition pathways of DMAI on Pt (a) (111), (b) (100)
and (c) edge sites with double hydroxyls.

Fig. S10.† The reaction barriers of isopropanol and methane
formation (denoted as Ea(Al–O) and Ea(Al–C), respectively)
between the isolated and double hydroxyl models (denoted as
Pt–1OH and Pt–2OH, respectively) are compared in Table 1. It
was found that DMAI dissociation on Pt–2OH is not only more
kinetically facile due to the lower decomposition barriers but is
also more exothermic compared with Pt–1OH. In a word, double
hydroxyl sites with suitable distance facilitate the decomposi-
tion of DMAI both thermodynamically and kinetically.
3.3 Hydrolyzation mechanism of residual precursors on Pt
slabs
Due to the huge diﬃculty of further decomposition of residual
intermediates aer rst-step dissociation on the Pt facets dis-
cussed above, we investigated the process where water in the
H2O half cycle decomposes the residual surface intermediates
instead of direct dissociation. The process is referred to as the
hydrolyzation mechanism, and corresponding reaction
diagrams are shown in Fig. 6. On Pt (111), because Al–O bond
scission is more kinetically facile than Al–C bond breakage
(Fig. 5a), (CH3)2Al(O*OH) is the primary residual surface inter-
mediate aer DMAI rst-step decomposition. Accordingly, the
hydrolyzation process of (CH3)2Al(O*OH) at Pt (111) is consid-
ered in Fig. 6a. Obviously, the hydrolyzation in which (CH3)2-
Al(O*OH) reacts with one gaseous H2O is more favorable; it
shows a lower barrier of 0.16 eV than the direct decomposition
(1.20 eV in Fig. 5a). Regarding the transition state (TS), we can
see that O of H2O gradually approaches the Al atoms, which can
elongate the Al–C bond and promote breakage of the Al–C bond.
Finally, an H atom of H2O binds with the methyl of (CH3)2-
Al(O*OH) to form gaseous methane, and the residual hydroxyl
of H2O binds with the Al atom to regenerate a new hydroxyl site
for further Al2O3 growth. In contrast, Al–C scission in ES4 is
more favorable than Al–O breakage at the Pt (100) facet, as
shown in Fig. 5b, and we only consider the hydrolyzation of the
production of ES4 ((C 2H5O)Al(CH3)(O*OH)) in Fig. 6b. We
found that the H atomrstly binds with O of the residual radical
via hydrogen bonding in the transition state, which stretches
the Al–O bond and favors its scission. Aer this, the hydroxyl of
H2O recombines with the Al-group and an isopropanol is
released; this exhibits a lower barrier compared with the direct
decomposition process in Fig. 5b. This situation also occurs on
edge sites, as shown in Fig. 6c. The hydrogen of H2O interacts
with the oxygen of isopropanolvia hydrogen bonding to assist
decomposition of the residual intermediates, with a barrier of
0.19 eV. Meanwhile, it was also found that the hydrolyzation
processes are more exothermic than the direct decomposition
of the residual intermediates. Accordingly, H2O as the critical
assistant for further dissociation not only decreases the
decomposition barrier in kinetics, but also makes the process
spontaneous by thermodynamics. On the other hand, aer the
hydrolyzation, similar con gurations of the single methyl
appear at diﬀerent Pt facets. A previous study of ALD with a TMA
precursor indicated that the remaining single methyl binding Al
can be easily removed by the production of CH4 through water
exposure.27
3.4 Microkinetic models of DMAI decomposition
Based on the discussion above, we established a simplied
microkinetic model of DMAI decomposition on Pt facets with
double hydroxyls as the reasonable AlOx deposition model. In

the model, we only consider the DMAI adsorption andrst-step
decompositions (ES1, ES2 and ES4 in Scheme 1), as illustrated
in Fig. 7a. Furthermore, the DMAI adsorption steps are
assumed to be quasi-equilibrated (r1 ¼ 0) due to the relatively
low adsorption barriers. Because the decomposition steps are
dramatically exothermic, these steps are treated as irreversible
processes. Based on this, the overall deposition rate (R) can be
summarized as the sum of the forward rates (r2 + r4) of both
DMAI decomposition steps (ES2 and ES4), as follows:
r1 ¼ k1q*ðOHÞ2P /C0 k/C0 1qðC2H5OÞAlðCH3Þ2*ðOHÞ2 ¼ 0
r2 ¼ k2qðC2H5OÞAlðCH3Þ2*ðOHÞ2
r4 ¼ k4qðC2H5OÞAlðCH3Þ2*ðOHÞ2
R ¼ r2 þ r4
where R, ri and ki are the overall reaction rate, rate of the
elementary step i and rate constant of the elementary step I,
respectively. P is the partial pressure of DMAI in the precursor
ow and is set as 40 Pa.
A crucial assumption is that the amount of residual products
aer rst-step decomposition is set as a constant (1/C0 a)t o
represent the coverage of deposited AlOx at the Pt facets, based
on the fact that these residual products can be facilely trans-
formed into AlOx species through hydrolyzation processes.
More importantly, this assumption can simulate the realistic
surface situation where as the ALD cycles increase, AlOx grad-
ually covers the Pt slabs and causes changes in the amount of
free sites available for DMAI adsorption and decomposition in
the ALD process. On the basis of this consideration, we can
obtain the overall deposition rate expression as follows:
q*ðOHÞ2 þ qðC2H5OÞAlðCH3Þ2*ðOHÞ2 þ qðAlOxÞ¼ 1
qðAlOxÞ¼ 1 /C0 a
0q*ðOHÞ2 þ qðC2H5OÞAlðCH3Þ2*ðOHÞ2 ¼ að0 #a #1Þ
R ¼ aðk2 þ k4Þk1P
k/C0 1 þ k1P
From these formulas, we cannd that the factora, repre-
senting the available surface sites aer a certain number of ALD
cycles, only linearly aﬀects the deposition rate. Thus, we assume
a as 0.5 as the representative example of partially coated Pt
facets. Furthermore, taking account of the larger barrier of the
reversible process than of the forward process in DMAI
adsorption, the reversible reaction rate constantk/C0 1 is far less
than k1P of the forward reaction. Thus, the overall reaction rate
can be further simplied to:
R ¼ 0.5(k2 + k4)
According to the microkinetic expression, we calculated the
AlOx deposition rates at diﬀerent facets in the temperature range
from 300 to 425 K, as shown in Fig. 7b. The dashed line denotes
the experimental temperature (393 K). We cannd that at 393 K,
AlOx deposition at Pt (111) is faster than at other slabs, which
suggests a preference for AlOx growth at Pt (111) with DMAI as
the precursor. This trend was maintained in the temperature
zone we studied due to the much higher deposition rate at Pt
(111). Meanwhile, at 393 K, the rate diﬀerence between the edge
sites and Pt (100) is relatively small in comparison with the
deviations between Pt (111) and the other sites. Notably, the
deposition rate at Pt (100) tends to a steady value above 350 K due
to the relatively weak DMAI adsorption. The largest diﬀerence in
the deposition rates at diﬀerent slabs is smaller than 2 orders of
magnitude, which also indicates that all the Pt sites will be
covered by AlOx species aer enough ALD cycles and, therefore,
the growth preference can no longer be maintained. In summary,
site preference of Pt slabs can be achieved through tailoring the
ALD cycles with DMAI as the Al-containing precursor.
Actually, a previous related experimental study indicates that
the temperature window of AlO x deposition with DMAI as
a precursor is about 120 –150 /C14 C (393 –423 K).35,46 In this
temperature window, according to the theoretical results, rela-
tively high temperature brings about simultaneous promotion
of the reaction rates at the (111) and edge sites, which weakens
the diﬀerence in the eﬀects of the AlOx deposition rate on the
diﬀerent sites and leads to less remarkable selectivity. On the
other hand, at temperatures lower and higher than the realistic
temperature window, the surface reaction process may be
diﬀerent from the standard ALD process. At temperatures below
100 /C14 C (373 K), because the thermal energy is insuﬃcient for
a complete binary surface half reaction to occur, the growth rate
is very low.35 Furthermore, at low temperature, it is diﬃcult to
remove physically adsorbed DMAI in the N2 purge process; also,
there is unavoidable DMAI residue in the ALD chamber, which
aﬀects the next ALD process. At elevated temperatures of 180–
210 /C14 C (453–483 K), an additional CVD eﬀect may occur through
decomposition of the precursor due to high substrate temper-
atures.35 These processes are not included in our theoretical
model based on the experimental situation at the temperature
of 120 /C14 C (393 K). This also means that due to the changing
reaction processes, it is relatively diﬃcult to predict the reaction
behaviour beyond this temperature window with this model.
3.5 Experimental evidence of selective AlOx growth
Our experiment of Pt ALD with DMAI as a precursor also
conrmed the selectivity of AlOx deposition on Pt facets. FTIR
signals of CO chemisorption on AlOx-coated Pt nanoparticles
with 0, 1, 3 and 5 ALD cycles are shown in Fig. 8. The three

tting peaks of the linear adsorption curves are assigned to CO
adsorbed on the Pt (111) (blue), (100) (orange), and low-
coordinated sites (green) according to previous work.26,48
Because the vertex site only occupies a small piece of the surface
area of the nanoparticle, the low-coordinated sites are attrib-
uted to edge sites.11 It should be noted that the peak area in
Fig. 8 represents the residual Pt sites aer a certain number of
ALD cycles. It was found that aer 3 ALD cycles, the signal of the
Pt (111) facets had already disappeared and the signals of Pt
(100) and edge sites still existed, which demonstrates that Pt
(111) is entirely covered by deposited AlOx but that the Pt (100)
and edge sites remain available for CO adsorption. Further-
more, the HRTEM image of AlOx-coated Pt nanoparticles with 3
ALD cycles is shown in Fig. S11.† Because the amorphous AlOx
thin lm shows ambiguous lattice fringes, we only accounted
for the diﬀerence in material contrast; we found that the Pt NPs
appear to be partially encapsulated, but detailed information
about the coated facets was diﬃcult to obtain. Combining
HRTEM with the FTIR data, we can conclude that selective
decoration of AlOx on Pt (111) was achieved in the sample with 3
AlOx ALD cycles. This experimental phenomenon agrees well
with the theoretical predictions of the site preference of AlOx
growth. Another trend is that as the ALD cycles of AlOx continue
to increase, the signals of the Pt facets gradually decrease to
zero. This situation can be ascribed to the relatively small
diﬀerence in the intrinsic deposition rates on Pt facets accord-
ing to the microkinetic results in Fig. 7b. Generally speaking,
our experimental results give credible evidence for selective
AlOx encapsulation at Pt (111) with the DMAI precursor.
According to previous studies on selective encapsulation,10,49
we expected that preferential coating on Pt (111) would be
favourable for achieving superior thermal stability of Pt NPs. On
the other hand, the nonreactive interface of inert AlOx and the
Pt NPs cannot provide new catalytic sites. Thus, the advantage
of partial Al2O3 encapsulation on Pt NPs is achieving stability
while sustaining the reactivity for as long as possible. Pt nano-
particles have extensive applications in energyelds in view of
their high reactivity towards various chemical processes. Espe-
cially, the low-index (111), (100), and (110) facets of Pt have
much lower activity than the high-index planes with high
densities of atomic steps, ledges, and kinks as active sites for
ORR, HOR, HER,etc.50–52 However, in a fuel cell environment, Pt
particles suﬀer from Ostwald ripening and agglomeration,
which leads to degradation of the Pt NPs and loss of the
precious metal catalyst in fuel cell cathodes.51 Our work may
provide a feasible strategy for preferential decoration of specic
facets of Pt nanoparticles to balance reactivity and stability,
which provides novel guidance for the design of fuel cell
catalysts.
3.6 Substituent e ﬀects in DMAI precursor
The TMA decomposition pathways on Pt facets with double
hydroxyls were studied and are shown in Fig. S12.† It was found
that TMA decomposition proceeds more easily than DMAI
decomposition; more importantly, the small barrier diﬀerence
at diﬀerent facets indicates no selectivity of ALD with TMA
precursor, which agrees well with the experimental results
shown in Fig. S13.† The behaviour of TMA at Pt nanoparticles
was also demonstrated in a previous study.27 Furthermore, to
explain the selectivity diﬀerence of TMA and DMAI in nature, we
considered the substituent eﬀects on charge distribution and
steric hindrance, as shown in Fig. 9. We found that because of
the stronger electronegativity of oxygen than of carbon atom,
more electrons of the aluminum atom in DMAI transfer to the
Fig. 8 Fitting curves of the linear CO adsorption spectra on AlOx-
coated Pt nanoparticles after (a) 0, (b) 1, (c) 3 and (d) 5 ALD cycles.

related binding atoms compared with that of TMA, which
results in a more positive valence of Al atom in DMAI. This gives
rise to stronger electrostatic interactions between the Al and C
atoms of DMAI, which is manifested by the shorter Al–C bond
lengths and more diﬃcult Al–C scissions in DMAI compared
with those in TMA. Also, the rigid structure of TMA consisting of
three Al–CH3 groups cannot release the repulsive interaction
from the hydroxylated surface when TMA gradually approaches
the adsorption sites. To some extent, this explains the barrier-
less decomposition of TMA to form C2H6 at the (111) and edge
sites and the weak TMA adsorption as well as the facile TMA
dissociation at (100) shown in Fig. S12.† In turn, the rotary Al–
O–C bonds enable the isopropanol fragment to move far away
from the surface through the slight spontaneous relaxation of
the local structure, as shown in Fig. 9b; this results in stable
DMAI adsorption. In a word, the isopropanol fragment of DMAI
gives rise to a strong Al–C bond and stable surface adsorption.
The substituent eﬀect in DMAI enables selective deposition of
AlOx. Furthermore, the stable adsorption conguration of DMAI
at Pt (111) provides favorable Al–O scission through hydrogen
bond eﬀects, which enables relatively high deposition activity at
Pt (111) compared to the other sites.
4 Conclusions
In our work, wend that DMAI can be used as a precursor to
selectively decorate Pt facets with inert AlO x. Through our
computations, we propose a mechanism of DMAI decomposi-
tion on hydroxylated Pt slabs andnd that double hydroxyl sites
at the Pt facets enable facile DMAI decomposition in compar-
ison with the single hydroxyl model. Furthermore, hydro-
lyzation of residual surface intermediates is more favorable
than their direct dissociation without H2O participation.
Further microkinetic analysis and experimental evidence indi-
cates that AlOx with DMAI as a precursor and Al-containing
source can preferentially coat the Pt (111) surface and leave
other sites available for catalytic reactionsvia tailoring the ALD
cycles due to the relatively high intrinsic decomposition reac-
tivity of DMAI at the Pt (111) facets. The substituent eﬀect leads
to strong Al–C bonding in DMAI and stable DMAI adsorption,
which gives clear guidance for ALD precursor design. In general,
our work aﬀords new insight into the selective growth mecha-
nism and provides a feasible strategy for selective decoration of
Pt nanoparticles.
