abstract
The chlorine loss reactions of ZrO2 thin ﬁlms of atomic layer deposition on the hydroxylated silicon sur-
face have been studied by the density functional theory. Fourteen possible pathways are designed to
investigate the detailed chlorine loss reaction mechanism based on the two-dimer trench silicon cluster
model. Experiment shows that HCl self-elimination is the dominant reaction pathway at the low temper-
atures, and that hydrolysis is the dominant pathway at elevated temperatures for the second chlorine loss
reaction. However, our calculations show that raising temperature would not result in HCl self-elimina-
tion reaction to be unfavorable. Therefore, the decrease of the number of hydroxyls is the possible reason.
In addition, for the four chlorines loss, the reactions on the two-dimer cluster across the trench are com-
pared with those on the same dimer cluster from the viewpoint of energy.

1. Introduction
ZrO2 has emerged as the promising candidate for high-j gate
dielectrics in the microelectronics ﬁeld to replace SiO2, owing to
its high permittivity (high-j, j = 17–22), large band gap and thermal
stability on silicon substrates[1]. Among various fabrication meth-
ods for growing high-j thin ﬁlms, atomic layer deposition (ALD)
shows its unique advantages in depositing ultra thin ﬁlms with
highly conformal and uniform growth over large areas. In ALD, each
precursor is pulsed onto the substrate surface in the reaction cham-
ber alternately, and the reaction between the incoming precursors
and surface species is self-terminating. As a result, atomic level con-
trol of ﬁlm growth can be achieved[2].
Knowledge of the reaction mechanisms as well as the kinetic
and thermodynamic data could be used to optimize the ALD pro-
cess conditions. Therefore, it is important to explore the reaction
mechanism of high-j oxides grown by ALD. In recent years, ALD
growth mechanisms of high-j oxides (e.g., HfO2 [1,3–6], ZrO2
[3,7–9] and Al2O3 [7,10]) on silicon surfaces have been extensively
studied both experimentally and theoretically.
ZrO2 thin ﬁlms have been grown by ALD most commonly using
ZrCl4 [6,7,11,12] and ZrI4 [8,13] as metal precursors. The oxygen
sources are usually H2O [14], hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [13] and
ozone [8]. However, ZrCl4 has some distinct drawbacks such as
the contamination of chlorine and the release of corrosive HCl
by-product when it is used as the metal precursor. Thus it is impor-
tant to obtain the mechanism of chlorine loss in ALD-grown ZrO2 in
order to deposit high quality ZrO2 thin ﬁlm. Experiment[15] has
found that at low temperature (e.g., 180/C176C) two chlorine ligands
are released during the ZrCl4 pulse. The remaining two chlorine
groups on the surface are released during the H2O pulse. However,
with increasing substrate temperature, the number of chlorine loss
decrease gradually during the ZrCl4 pulse. At 400/C176C, only one chlo-
rine ligand is released, and the other three are lost during the H2O
pulse.
Based on two different reactive sites, for the ZrO2 deposition
using ZrCl4 as the metal precursor and H2O as the oxygen source,
the four chlorine loss reactions can be totally divided into fourteen
pathways (R1a–R7a and R1b–R7b) depicted inScheme 1. R1a–R7a
belong to the surface reactions on the same dimer, and R1b–R7b be-
long to the surface reactions on the two dimers adjacent. R1a and
R1b are the ﬁrst chlorine loss reactions on the same dimer and on
the adjacent dimers, respectively. R2a and R2b denote the two pos-
sible pathways of the second chlorine loss reaction, where the prod-
ucts of R1a and R1b react with their neighboring hydroxyls. The
second chlorine loss of ZrCl4 can also be completed by the reactions
between water precursor and the products of R1a and R1b, that is,
R3a and R3b. The products of R2a, R2b, R3a and R3b can continue
to react with water to lose the third chlorine of ZrCl4, which are de-
noted by R4a, R4b, R5a and R5b, respectively. R6a, R6b, R7a and R7b
are similarly used to denote the pathways of the fourth chlorine loss
reaction between water precursor and the products of R4a, R4b, R5a
and R5b, respectively.

2. Computational method and models
Si9H12 one-dimer cluster in previous studies[16–20] was usu-
ally used to simulate Si(100)/C02 /C21 surface based on its predom-
inantly localized bonding characteristics. In the current work, a
larger Si23H24 two-dimer trench cluster (shown inFig. 1) is em-
ployed to diminish the cluster size effect. The Si23H24 two-dimer
cluster is composed of four layer silicon atoms where the top four
silicon atoms compose the surface dimers. The remaining silicon
atoms compose three subsurface layers, which are terminated by
hydrogen atoms to prevent from unrealistic charge transferring.
The four surface hydroxyls of Si23H24–(OH)4 are used as surface
reactive sites. The structure of the cluster will be fully optimized
in all calculations.
All calculations are performed at B3LYP[21–23] level using the
GAUSSIAN 03 software package[24]. A mixed basis set scheme is
used to save the computational source because the cluster models
used are relatively large in this study. A diffuse double-zeta plus
polarization 6–31+G(d) basis set for Cl, O and H atoms and the
LANL2DZ basis set and an effective core potential for Zr and Si atoms
are used in every calculation. The geometries of stationary points on
the potential energy surfaces are optimized followed by frequency
calculations to verify the nature of the stationary points, which in-
clude energy minima (all positive frequencies) and transition states
(TSs, one imaginary frequency), and to obtain the thermodynamic
properties at ﬁnite temperatures. All energies reported here include
zero-point energy corrections.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The ﬁrst chlorine loss reaction during the ZrCl4 pulse
Two chlorine ligands loss during ZrCl4 pulse at the low tempera-
tures is reported by experiment[15]. From the reaction mechanism
point of view, the second chlorine can react with the neighboring
surface hydroxyl. Thus we select one of the two middle surface
hydroxyls as the starting reactive site because the ZrCl3 fragment
formed in the ﬁrst chlorine loss reaction can react with the neighbor-
ing hydroxyl either on the same dimer or on the adjacent dimers
across the trench.
The predicted energies of every stationary point at 0 K, and the
optimized geometries along the reaction pathways (R1a and R1b)
are shown inFigs. 2 and 3. At the beginning of two pathways, a
gaseous ZrCl4 molecule exposes on the surface sites and forms a
chemisorbed state (CS) exothermically by 132.0 kJ/mol. The ad-
sorbed complex is formed owing to the donation of the oxygen
lone-pair electrons of hydroxyl into an emptyd-orbital of the Zr
atom [25]. After the adsorption, both pathways proceed through
a four-center TS composed of H–O–Zr–Cl (TS inFigs. 2 and 3),
and then one Cl atom of the adsorbed ZrCl4 recombines with the
H atom of the surface hydroxyl to form HCl. Finally, both reactions
ﬁnish along with the release of a gaseous by-product HCl. Calcula-
tions show that the activation barrier for HCl formation of R1a is
91.0 kJ/mol relative to its CS, higher than that (60.9 kJ/mol) of
R1b. The reaction heats of R2a and R2b are 50.1 and 93.4 kJ/ mol,
respectively. R1a is obviously a less exothermic reaction as

compared to R1b. Thus we suggest that R1b is energetically more
favorable than R1a.
Stable physisorbed HCl molecules are found in both pathways
because of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the H atom
of HCl and the O atom of the surface hydroxyl. The schematic dia-
grams are depicted in PS(R1a) and PS(R1b) ofFig. 3 using dashed
line, where PS is the acronym for ‘‘physisorbed state’’. For R1a
and R1b, the distances of O–H are 1.76 and 1.75 Å, respectively,
which are within the effective distance of hydrogen bonding inter-
action, and the bond lengths of H–Cl are both 1.32 Å, which are
slightly longer than the normal HCl molecule (1.29 Å). In addition,
the desorption energies are 20.4 and 17.7 kJ/mol uphill relative to
their own PSs for R1a and R1b, respectively. This indicates that a
long HCl purging time is needed to eliminate contamination of
chlorine in the ALD process.
3.2. The second chlorine loss reaction
Theoretically, the ZrCl3 groups formed in R1a and R1b can either
react with the neighboring surface hydroxyl (i.e., HCl self-elimina-
tion reaction) or react with H2O precursor (i.e., HCl-elimination
reaction via hydrolysis). Both types of reactions are followed by
the elimination of one HCl molecule as shown inScheme 1.I n
the two pathways of HCl self-elimination reaction, ZrCl3 group
can react with the neighboring hydroxyl either on the same dimer
(R2a) or on the adjacent dimer across the trench (R2b), respec-
tively, forming a bridged ZrCl2 group and liberating one by-product
HCl molecule (Fig. 4). Two HCl-elimination reactions via hydrolysis
(R3a and R3b), where ZrCl3 reacts with H2O precursor to form one
ZrCl2OH group and one HCl molecule are shown inFig. 5. There-
fore, total four pathways have been designed for the second chlo-
rine loss, where R2a and R2b are HCl self-elimination reactions
and R3a and R3b are HCl-elimination reactions via hydrolysis.
3.2.1. HCl self-elimination reaction for the second chlorine loss
R2a and R2b similarly proceed through a four-member TS
which is composed of H–O–Zr–Cl (TS inFig. 4). The predicted ener-
gies and the corresponding geometries along the reaction path-
ways are shown inTable 1 and Figs. 2 and 4. We ﬁnd that the
energy barrier for R2a is 69.8 kJ/mol relative to the product of
R1a, which is 2.8 kJ/mol slightly lower than that of R2b. Further-
more, the reaction heat of R2a is 68.1 kJ/mol, which is 14.6 kJ/
mol higher than that of R2b. Considering the negligible differences
in activation energies, we think that R2b is a more energetically
favorable pathway than R2a.
It should be noted that R2a and R2b are the following reactions
of R1a and R1b, respectively. As a result, both the activation barri-
ers and the products of R2b are below the initial reactants of R1b.
In other words, the chlorine loss reactions (R1b and R2b) are exo-
thermic (Fig. 2). In addition, comparing with the reaction pathways
on the same dimer (R1a and R2a), we ﬁnd that the reaction path-
ways on the adjacent dimers (R1b and R2b) are energetically more
favorable. Similar to R1a and R1b, stable physisorbed HCl mole-
cules have also been found in R2a and R2b. FromFig. 2, we can
see that the desorption energy of R2b is 20.0 kJ/mol, higher than
that (5.1 kJ/mol) of R2a.

3.2.2. HCl-elimination reaction via hydrolysis for the second chlorine
loss
For HCl-elimination reaction via hydrolysis, the potential
energy surfaces of two pathways (R3a and R3b) are shown in
Fig. 6. Gaseous H2O precursor and the surface ZrCl3 form stable
chemisorbed complexes with the release energies of 64.5 and
59.7 kJ/mol for R3a and R3b, respectively. The chemisorptions
are similarly owing to the donation of the oxygen lone-pair
electrons of H2O into an empty d-orbital of the Zr atom. Then,
both the pathways proceed through a four-member TS (H–O–
Zr–Cl) as shown in Fig. 5. The energy barrier of R3b is 69.8 kJ/
mol, which is 3.1 kJ/mol higher than R3a. Finally, the reactions
go through PSs and form the products. It can be seen from
Fig. 6 that R3a is an exothermic reaction; however, R3b is an
endothermic reaction. So we can argue that R3a is more energet-
ically favorable than R3b.

Physisorbed HCl molecules have also been found in R3a and R3b.
We can see inFig. 5that the hydrogen bonding interaction (dashed
line) resulting in the physisorption comes from different types of
surface hydroxyls. The main difference from R3a is that besides
the new formed Zr–OH, the Si–OH also plays a role in the hydrogen
bonding interaction for R3b. Therefore, the adsorbed energy of R3b is
higher than that of R3a.
3.2.3. Temperature effects on the second chlorine loss
Temperature can affect almost all the chemical reactions as we
all know. Experiment[15] shows that half of the chlorine atoms are
released during the ZrCl4 pulse while the remained chlorine atoms
are released during the H2O pulse at low temperature, and only
one chlorine is released per molecule during the ZrCl4 pulse, the
other three being liberated during the H2O pulse at elevated tem-
peratures. To investigate the temperature effects on the second
chlorine loss, the reaction energies at 0 K(DE0) and Gibbs free en-
ergy change (DG) at 298, 400, 500, 600, 700 K for R2a/R2b and
R3a/R3b are calculated and shown inTable 1.
We can see inTable 1, R2a and R2b have lower activation bar-
riers and more heat release with temperature rising when compar-
ing with R3a and R3b, respectively. Thus, we can suggest that R2a
and R2b are more energetically favorable than R3a and R3b, i.e. HCl
self-elimination reaction is more thermodynamically favorable
than HCl-elimination reaction via hydrolysis at elevated tempera-
tures. However, experiments[15] have shown that R3a and R3b
rather than R2a and R2b will be the main reaction pathways at ele-
vated temperatures. Theoretical studies[26] have shown the num-
ber of surface hydroxyls will affect the chlorine loss at elevated
temperatures, because surface hydroxyls will form water with
each other, and this trend can be strengthened at elevated temper-
atures. In order to look for the water loss reaction pathway, the ﬁ-
nal product of the four chlorine loss reaction is employed as the
model. This allows us to simulate the water loss mechanism on
the growing ZrO2 ﬁlms. Calculation shows that the neighboring
Zr–OH can easily form the bridged Zr–O–Zr group with an activa-
tion energy of 36.2 kJ/mol (TS is shown inFig. 7). The replacement
of surface hydroxyl by bridged oxygen would result in the decrease
of HCl self-elimination reactions R2a and R2b. As a result, HCl-
elimination reaction via hydrolysis, i.e., R3a and R3b, will become
the dominating chlorine loss pathways at elevated temperatures.
3.3. The third chlorine loss reaction during the H2O pulse
There are two types of products, i.e., –O–ZrCl2–O– and –O–
ZrCl2OH, formed in the reactions of the second chlorine loss
(R2a/R2b and R3a/R3b). The formed ZrCl2 groups can react with
water precursor, i.e. R4a, R4b, R5a and R5b, which are shown in
Scheme 1. Theoretically, the –O–ZrCl2OH can react with its neigh-
boring hydroxyl and release one HCl molecule. As mentioned
above the number of neighboring hydroxyls would decrease
greatly as the temperature is raised. Thus the reactions between
–O–ZrCl2OH and its neighboring hydroxyl have not been discussed
in this study.
R4a and R4b are the reactions of the products of R2a and R2b
with water, respectively. The corresponding energies of these path-
ways are shown inTable 2. Table 2shows that the activation bar-
rier for HCl formation of R4b is 75.5 kJ/mol relative to its
adsorption state, which is 39.1 kJ/mol lower than R4a. R4a and
R4b are both the endothermic reactions whose reaction heats are
11.3 and 14.5 kJ/mol, respectively.
Similarly, R5a and R5b are the following hydrolysis reactions of
the products of R3a and R3b, respectively. It can be found that R5b
has lower activation barrier and less positive reaction heat than
R5a. As a result, we think R5b is the favorable pathway for the third
chlorine loss reaction at elevated temperatures.
3.4. The fourth chlorine elimination reaction during the H2O pulse
There is only one chlorine on Zr atom in forms of –O–ZrClOH–
O– and –O–ZrCl(OH)2 after the loss of the third chlorine atom,
and the two intermediate products can react with H2O to form
HCl and the ﬁnal products –O–Zr(OH)2–O– and –O–Zr(OH)3, which
are respectively denoted by the pathways of R6a, R6b, R7a and R7b.
The product of R4a reacts with water to lose the last chlorine de-
noted by R6a, and R7a is the reaction of the product of R5a reacting

with water. In the same way, R6b and R7b are the following reac-
tions of R4b and R5b, respectively.
The energies of each stationary point on the potential energy
surfaces of the above mentioned reaction pathways are also listed
in Table 2. The activation barrier of R6a is 106.4 kJ/mol, which is
37.0 kJ/mol higher than R6b. This shows that R6a is the energeti-
cally less favorable pathway. In contrast, R7a is the energetically
more favorable pathway because it has lower activation barrier
and more heat release as compare to R7b.
Combined the experiment ﬁndings with our calculations, R2b
and R3a should be the favorable pathway for the second chlorine
loss at the low and elevated temperatures, respectively. By the en-
ergy comparison of the corresponding reactions for the third and
fourth chlorines loss, we suggest that the reactions on the two-di-
mer trench cluster (R4b and R6b) should be the following reactions
of R2b at the low temperatures. In addition, R5b and R7a may occur
subsequently after R3a at elevated temperatures.
4. Conclusion
The reactions of chlorine loss of ALD-grown ZrO2 thin ﬁlms
using ZrCl4/H2O as a precursor combination has been studied by
the DFT in detail. Fourteen possible pathways for the chlorine loss
are proposed according to surface reactions occurring either on the
same dimer or on the adjacent dimers across the trench. We ﬁnd
that the precursor ZrCl4 can be adsorbed directly on the hydroxyl-
ated silicon surface to form a stable adsorbed complex, and that
the by-product HCl prefers to stay at the reactive surface in all
the fourteen pathways. These results indicate that the elimination
of chlorine contamination is needed in the process of manufactur-
ing ZrO2 thin ﬁlms. The temperature effects on the second chlorine
loss reaction are also studied theoretically based on the experi-
ments. Experiment shows that HCl self-elimination is the domi-
nant reaction pathway at the low temperatures, and hydrolysis is
the dominant pathway at elevated temperatures. However, our
calculation shows that raising temperature would not lead to HCl
self-elimination reaction to be unfavorable. Thus, the decrease of
the number of hydroxyls is the possible reason. For the third and
fourth chlorine loss, we ﬁnd that the reactions on the two-dimer
trench cluster are energetically more favorable than those on the
same dimer cluster at the low temperatures. In addition, we ﬁnd
that the third chlorine loss occurs on the adjacent dimers, and
the fourth chlorine loss occurs on the same dimer more easily at
elevated temperatures.
