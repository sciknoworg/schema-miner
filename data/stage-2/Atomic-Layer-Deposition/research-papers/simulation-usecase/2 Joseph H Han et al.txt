Abstract
Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) is one of the leading candidates to replace silicon oxide (SiO2) as the gate dielectric for
futuregenerationmetal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)basednanoelectronicdevices.Experimentalstudieshaveshown
thata1–3monolayerSiO2 ﬁlmbetweenthehighpermittivitymetaloxideandthesubstratesiliconisneededtominimize
electrical degradation. This study uses density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the initial growth reactions of
ZrO2 onhydroxylatedSiO 2 byatomiclayerdeposition(ALD).Thereactantsinvestigatedinthisstudyarezirconium
tetrachloride (ZrCl4) and water (H2O). Exchange reaction mechanisms for the two reaction half-cycles were investi-
gated. For the ﬁrst half-reaction, reaction of gaseous ZrCl4 with the hydroxylated SiO2 surface was studied.

SiO2 has been the gate dielectric of choice for
MOS devices for decades because it is easy to

because current leakage via direct tunneling
through the dielectric will become too large.
Oxynitrides (SiOxNy) oﬀer some improvements
over pure SiO2 and are now used commercially,
but they too are rapidly reaching fundamental
limits.Therefore,thereisanurgentneedtodevelop
alternative high permittivity (high-j) gate dielec-
tricstoreplaceSiO 2 [1].Usingahigh- j materialin
place of SiO2 allows one to structure a dielectric
ﬁlm whose EOT is, for example, less than 1 nm
yielding a high capacitance, yet has a physical
thickness where tunneling is insigniﬁcant. Candi-
datematerialsthathavehighpermittivityandare
thoughttobethermallystableonSiincludeAl2O3,
ZrO2,HfO2,Y2O3,La2O3,andafewothermate-
rials.ZrO2 isattractiveasithasabulkpermittivity

constant,ZrO2 ﬁlmshavebeenshowntobestable
with respect to reaction with substrate (or over-
layer)silicontotemperaturesashighas900/C176C[2].
This is an important property because some pro-
cessing steps after gate dielectric deposition can
reachtemperaturesashighas1000/C176C.
Atomiclayerdeposition(ALD)isadeposition
method for growing thin ﬁlms of various semi-
conducting,insulating,andmetallicmaterialswith
veryhighconformalityandprecisethicknesscon-
trol [3]. The deposition technique is based on
alternating exposure of a surface to two or more
gas phase precursors. The precursors are chosen
such that, at an appropriate temperature, they
react with the other precursor adsorbed on
thesurfacebutnot withthemselves.Atomiclevel
control is achieved because the reaction of
each precursor with the surface in each reaction
half-cycle is self-terminating, hence yielding at
most one monolayer of added species for each
half-cycle. The inherent precise control of the
deposition rate makes ALD an ideal choice for
deposition of gate dielectrics. ALD has been ac-
tively investigated for deposition of ZrO2 and
HfO2 [2,4–10]forwhichZrCl 4 andHfCl4,respec-
tively,andH 2Oareoftenusedasprecursors.
Experimental results over the past three years
have shown that the starting surface is critical in
initiatinggrowthandassuringuniformityforboth
ALD and CVD-grown high-j ﬁlms. The ﬁnal
propertiesoftheﬁlmarestronglyregulatedbythe
composition of the ﬁlm in the interfacial region

The best ﬁlms to date have had at least a few
monolayers of SiO2 present between the high-j
andthesubstratesilicon.Althoughthislowersthe

Inonestudy(typical ofmany)ZrO 2 deposited
on a thin native SiO2 ﬁlm was shown to have

EvenwhenSiO2 isremovedbyHFcleaningbefore
initiatingtheALDprocess,athinSiO 2 ﬁlmisstill
often observed between the Si surface and the
high-j dielectric,possiblyfromoxidationoftheSi
surface due to the presence of water during the
earlystagesoftheALDprocess.
In previously reported work, we have studied
mechanismsofinitiationofZrO 2 depositiononthe
clean Si surface using the B3LYP DFT method
[11]andALDofZrO 2 onZrO2,whichrepresents
growthofZrO 2 beyondtheﬁrstmonolayerusing

the B3LYP DFT method [12]. Minor energetic
diﬀerences are found between reactions of ZrCl4
and H2O on hydroxylated Si and ZrO2 surfaces.
The activation barrier for the ZrCl4 reaction on
the hydroxylated Si surface is 1.4 kcal/mol lower
than on ZrO2, and the activation barrier of the
H2Oreactionis1.1kcal/molhigheronSithanon
ZrO2. Since SiO2 is present below the deposited
ZrO2 ﬁlmevenafterremovalofthenativeoxideby
HFcleaning,thedepositionoftheﬁrstmonolayer
of ZrO2 may take place on SiO2. Since the pre-
dictedZrO2 ALDkineticsofthegrowingﬁlm[12]
are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the predicted
initialALDratesonhydroxylatedSi[11],ALDof
ZrO2 on SiO2 will most likely not diﬀer signiﬁ-
cantly from ZrO2 deposition on either hydroxyl-
ated Si or hydroxylated ZrO2. However, since
energetic diﬀerences would aﬀect the optimum
processconditionsfortheinitialdepositionversus
ALD of the growing ﬁlm, verifying the actual
reaction kinetics of ZrO2 on SiO2 can guide
development of ALD processes to produce high
quality ZrO2 ﬁlms. Consequently, exploring the
growth mechanism and associated energetics of
themajorZrO2 ALDgrowthreactionsonSiO 2 is
thesubjectofthisinvestigation.Wenotethatthe
generalbehaviorofZrO2 andHfO2 depositionare
remarkably similar; the subtle diﬀerences that do
existwillbediscussedelsewhere.
2. Calculational details
The reactions between the gaseous precursors
ZrCl4 andH2OwiththehydroxylatedSiO 2 surface
are predicted to proceed via an exchange mecha-
nism[3,9]andcanbeseparatedintothetwohalf-

second half-reaction, it is possible for hydroxyl
groups on neighboring zirconium atoms to un-
dergo a dehydration reaction thereby decreas-
ingthehydroxyldensityontheZrO 2 surface;this
eﬀect will be described in a future publication
[13].
To study the surface reactions, we performed
DFT quantum chemical simulations of reactions
on cluster models of the surface. The B3LYP
gradient-correctedhybridmethodwasusedforall
calculations.Theeﬀectivenessandaccuracyofthis
method for studying transition metals have been
investigated by Eriksson et al. [14]. Zirconium,
silicon,andchlorineweredescribedusingtheLos

tential,orECP,andadouble- f valenceshell)[15–
17].Wefoundthroughpreliminarystudiesthatthe
addition of polarization functions on light atoms
can signiﬁcantly improve the description of bond
energies. As such, hydrogen andoxygen were de-
scribedusingtheDunningD95(d,p)basisset[18].
The geometry is optimized by ﬁnding stationary
points followed by frequency calculations needed
to verify the nature of the stationary points on
thepotentialenergysurface(PES),tocalculatethe
zero-point energy corrections, and to obtain the
thermochemical properties at ﬁnite temperatures.
Theclusterswerenotconstrainedduringtheﬁnal
transitionstate(TS)searches.Allthecalculations
wereperformedusingGaussian98[19].
For the ﬁrst stage of this study, we used the
Si(OH)3–OH and Si(OH)3OZr(OH)3/C0x–Clx clus-
ters, wherex has values of 1–3, to represent the
SiO2–OH/C3and SiO2–O–Zr–Cl/C3surface sites,
respectively. The relatively small sizes of these
clusters greatly speed up the calculations so that
mechanismscanbeinvestigatedpractically.How-
ever,thesmallsizemayadverselyaﬀectthequality
of the results. To determine the reliability of the
results predicted by the smaller clusters and eval-
uatetheclustersizeeﬀect,wealsousedthelarger
clusters SiH3OSi(OH)2–OH, (SiH 3O)3Si–OH,
SiH3OSi(OH)2OZr(OH)3/C0x–Clx and(SiH3O)3SiO-

mechanical eﬀects of the surrounding material of

To investigate the reaction of ZrCl4 with mul-
tiplesurfacehydroxylgroups,aSi(OH) 2–OH/C3–O–
Si(OH)2–OH/C3cluster is used to represent two
surface hydroxyl groups separated by a siloxane
bridge. Based on results from the previous calcu-
lations in this work, the termination of the Si
atomswith–OHgroupsissuﬃcienttocapturethe

lations are also performed on clusters similar to
thoseusedbyJeloaicaetal.[10]inordertocom-

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction of ZrCl4 with SiO2–OH/C3surface sites
The PES of the reaction of Si(OH)3–OH+
ZrCl4,representingreactionsofgaseousZrCl 4 on
SiO2–OH/C3surface sites, is shown in Fig. 2. Note
that this PES is schematic in the sense that only
stationary points are calculated and the curve
drawnconnectingthesestatesisonlyindicativeof
the reactionpath.ZrCl4 ﬁrst adsorbs molecularly
onto the hydroxylated SiO2 surface and forms a
stablecomplexwiththeSiO 2–OH/C3surfacegroup.
Widjaja andMusgrave [11,12] have shown that a
similarcomplexisformedbetweenZrCl4 andhy-
droxyl groups on Si and ZrO2 through the inter-
actionbetweentheoxygenlone-pairelectronsand
anemptyd-orbitaloftheZratom.Thisresultsina
stable intermediate with a formation energy of
)16.9 kcal/mol. The complex formation energies
are )21.4 kcal/mol on Si and)28.1 kcal/mol on
ZrO2. Following the formation of this intermedi-
ate complex, one Cl atom of the adsorbed ZrCl4
combines with the H atom of the surface OH
group,formingHCl.Theactivationbarrierforthe

energy of the SiO2–OH–ZrCl4(a) adsorbed com-
plex,andtheformationoftheHClisendothermic

The activation barrier for HCl formation is 20.0
kcal/mol on Si and 21.3 kcal/mol on ZrO2 with
respect to the adsorbed complex, while HCl for-
mationisendothermicby13.9kcal/molonSiand
16.7 kcal/mol on ZrO2, both with respect to the

weaklyboundphysisorbedstate,andthendesorb
intothegasphaseasitdoesonSiandZrO2.The
physisorbedstatehasnotbeenfoundforreactions
on SiO2–OH/C3sites. The end result of the ZrCl4
reaction with the SiO2–OH/C3site, represented by
Si(OH)3–O–ZrCl3, is the replacement of the OH
groupoftheSiO 2–OH/C3surfacesitewiththreeZr–
Cl/C3bonds.

The atomistic mechanism of the reaction of
H2O+Si(OH)3–O–ZrCl3,representingthereaction
of H2O on SiO2–O–Zr–Cl/C3sites and removal of
the ﬁrst of the three Cl atoms bonded to Zr, is
illustrated in Fig. 3. The reaction also proceeds
through a trapping-mediated mechanism. Water
ﬁrst forms a stable complex with the Zr atom of
SiO2–O–Zr–Cl/C3throughdonationofthelone-pair
electrons of the oxygen atom of water into an
empty d-orbital of the Zr atom. The adsorbed
stateisagainstable;theH 2Oadsorptionreaction
is exothermic by 18.0 kcal/mol. The physisorbed
HCl(a)stateisthenformedthroughthereactionof
oneHatomfromtheincomingH2OandaClatom
fromtheSiO 2–O–ZrCl3 surfacesite.Theenergyof
the transition state leading to the formation of
HCl(a) is 20.3 kcal/mol relative to the adsorbed
stateandthereactionisendothermicby17.3kcal/
mol relative to the complex. Physisorbed HCl(a)

mol uphill relative to the physisorbed state.
ReactionofH2OonSiandZrO 2 followsasimilar
pathway with an HCl desorption energy of 3.1
kcal/molonSiand4.5kcal/molonZrO 2.
RemovalofthesecondandthirdClatomsfrom
the active SiO2–O–Zr–(OH)3/C0xCl/C3
x sites proceeds
through an analogous trapping-mediated mecha-
nism. Formation of an absorbed H2O complex is
followed by reaction of one Cl atom with one H
atom from water to form physisorbed HCl. The

complex,theactivationbarriersforHClformation
are 20.3, 19.8, and 14.8 kcal/mol for the ﬁrst,
second,andthirdClremoval,respectively.
Theloweractivationbarriersfortheremovalof
the second and third Cl atoms are the result of
successive weakening of the Zr–Cl bond by the
increasingnumberofOHgroupsbondedtotheZr
atom.AsshowninTable1,theZr–Clbondlength
ofthewatercomplexincreasesfrom2.48/C23Aforthe
ﬁrstClto2.52and2.53 /C23Aforthesecondandthird
Clatoms,respectively.Onepossibleexplanationof
thiseﬀectisthatdonationoftheOlonepairinto
an empty d-orbital of the Zr atom in addition to
thecovalentbondsbetweentheZratomandtheO
atoms weakens the Zr–Cl bonds. This electron
donationeﬀectcanalsoexplaintheweakeningof
the H2O absorbed complex with the increasing
number of OH groups bonded to the Zr atom,
manifested by the change in the water complex
formationenergy,asmentionedabove.
The desorption energy of physisorbed HCl is
1.2 kcal/mol for removal of the ﬁrst Cl, 6.8 kcal/
mol for removal of the second Cl and 9.4 kcal/
mol for removal of the third Cl. The progressive
increase in the HCl desorption energy for re-
moval of the second and third Cl atoms can be
partially explained by the increased stability of
the physisorbed HCl that results because the OH
group that replaces the Cl atom occupies less
space than the Cl atom and thus results in less
steric interactions. This in turn allows closer
bonding of the HCl(a) to the surface Zr–OH/C3
sites, as evident from the decreasein the distance
between HCl(a) and the O atom of the Zr–OH/C3
site that replaces the Zr–Cl/C3site. Another cause
for the increase in desorption energy is the error
introduced by using a small cluster for the cal-
culation. As shown in Table 1, the distance be-
tween the Cl atom of HCl(a) and the nearest H
atom used to terminate the Si–O bonds changed
from 2.46/C23A for removal of the ﬁrst Cl atom, to
2.44/C23AforremovalofthesecondClatom,to2.42
/C23A for removal of the third Cl atom. This error
can be corrected by using a larger cluster for the
calculation, as shown below.

3.3. The eﬀect of cluster truncation
To investigate the cluster size eﬀect on the

and(SiH3O)3Si–OHclusters.Resultsareshownin

formationoftheadsorbedcomplexis)16.9kcal/
molwiththeSi(OH) 3–OHcluster, )17.8kcal/mol
with the SiH3OSi(OH)2–OH cluster and )17.8
kcal/mol with the (SiH3O)3Si–OH cluster. The
energyoftheoverallreactioncalculatedusingthe
three clusters also varied by a maximum of 0.9
kcal/mol. The largest diﬀerence in energy is ob-
served between values calculated using the
Si(OH)3–OH and the SiH3OSi(OH)2–OH clus-
ters. Energies calculated using an even larger
cluster, (SiH3O)3Si–OH, only showed a 0.8 kcal/
mol deviation from the results calculated with
Si(OH)3–OH,whichisthesmallestcluster.Cluster
size had no eﬀect on the calculated activation
barrier for HCl formation. Consequently, the
reaction of ZrCl4 on the SiO2 surface does not
exhibitsigniﬁcantnon-localeﬀectsandthesmaller
Si(OH)3–OHclusterisagoodmodelofthesurface

surfacereactionatsinglehydroxylsites.
We also calculated the reaction energetics for
thereactionofH 2OontheSiO 2–O–ZrCl/C3

site using three diﬀerent clusters. Since the active

(SiH3O)3SiOZrCl3 clusters, representing products
of the ﬁrst half-reaction using the Si(OH)3–OH,
SiH3OSi(OH)2–OH and (SiH3O)3Si–OH clusters,
were used in the calculation. The results showed
negligiblediﬀerences.Theinsensitivityofthereac-
tion energetics to the size of the SiO2 cluster
demonstrates that the reaction of water on the
SiO2–O–ZrCl/C3
3 site does not exhibit signiﬁcant
non-localeﬀects,asonewouldexpect.

three Cl atoms bonded to Zr calculated using
the (SiH3O)3SiOZrCl3 cluster. The patterns are
similar to that calculated using the smaller

physisorbed HCl and a higher HCl desorption
energy.AsmentionedinSection2,theerrorfrom
usingthesmallerclusterisduetointerferenceofH
atoms used to terminate the subsurface Si–O
bonds.ThecloseproximitybetweentheseHatoms
and the physisorbed HCl alters the transition
state barrier and increases the desorption energy.
However, the maximum diﬀerence calculated is
only 2.7 kcal/mol, which is not large enough to
alterthenatureofthereactionmechanism.
With the (SiH3O)3SiOZrCl3 cluster, the inter-
actionbetweentheHatomsusedtoterminatethe
subsurfaceSi–Obondsandthegaseousprecursors
is negligible. As shown in Table 1, the distance
betweentheClatomofthephysisorbedHCland
nearest H atom used to terminate the Si is in-
creasedto3.56 /C23A.
As we have shown in Section 2, when a small
cluster is used for the calculation, the H atoms
usedtoterminatethesubsurfaceSi–Obondsmay
interfere with the calculation and induce a small

3.4. Comparison of ZrO2 growth on SiO2, ZrO2 and
the OH terminated Si surface
Figs.9and10showthecomparisonofPESsfor
the deposition of ZrO2 on the OH terminated Si
surface, ZrO2 and SiO2. We use Zr–OH/C3and Si–
OH/C3todenotehydroxylatedZrO 2 andSisurfaces,
respectively. Similarly, Zr–O–ZrCl/C3and Si–O–
ZrCl/C3denotetheproductsofZrCl 4 adsorptionon
the respective Zr–OH/C3and Si–OH/C3surfaces. The
PESs representing surface reactions of ZrCl4 and
H2O on SiO2 and ZrO2 surface sites show little
diﬀerence.Clearly, very little qualitative energetic
diﬀerence exists for the initiation of the ﬁrst
monolayer of ZrO2 on SiO2 and subsequent
thickening of ZrO2 because the reactions do not
show signiﬁcant non-local eﬀects, as previously
discussed.
However, even though the shape of the PESs
aresimilarforthediﬀerentsurfaces,diﬀerencesin
the relative energies are present. Compared with

transition state activation barrier and a 2.1 kcal/
molhigherenergyfortheHCldesoprtion.Forthe
second half-reaction, the energy for the interme-
diatecomplexformationis0.7kcal/molhigher,the
activation barrier is 0.1 kcal/mol lower, and the
HCl desorption energy is 1.4 kcal/mol higher for
the reaction on the Si surface. The energetics of
ZrO2 deposition on hydroxylated SiO2 do not
deviatequalitativelyfromZrO 2 depositiononthe
–OH terminated Si surface; however, depending
upon the reactor temperature, diﬀerences on the
order of 5 kcal/mol could be suﬃcient to change
thegrowthrate.
One distinctive characteristic of both half-
reactionsinvolvestheformationofastableinter-
mediate complex, regardless of the initial surface
condition. Widjaja and Musgrave [11,12] have
shownthatthecomplexesareformedthroughthe
interaction between an oxygen lone-pair and an
emptyd-orbitalofZr.Fortheﬁrsthalf-cycle,the
lone-pair electrons come from the oxygen of the
hydroxylatedSi,ZrO 2 andSiO2 surfaces(Si–OH/C3,
Zr–OH/C3andSiO2–OH/C3sites),respectively,andthe
ZratomcomesfromtheZrCl 4 precursormolecule.
For the second half-cycle, the lone-pair electrons
come from the oxygen of H2O and the Zr atom
comes from the Si–O–ZrCl/C3, the Zr–O–ZrCl/C3or
the SiO2–O–ZrCl/C3surface sites. The electron
donationfromanoxygenlone-pairtotheemptyd-
orbital of the Zr atom is relatively exothermic,
resultinginadsorptionenergiesof )21.4kcal/mol

Asreportedpreviously[12],thefreeenergiesof
the complex shift up with respect to the initial
precursor state andthe ﬁnalstate with increasing
temperature.Thisresultsinreducedstabilityofthe
complex intermediates. Around 600 K, the asso-
ciatedproductfreeenergiesbecomelowerthanthe
adsorbed intermediate free energies. This shows
thatraisingthetemperatureshiftstheequilibrium
concentration from the complex towards the
products.However,athightemperatures,theacti-
vation free energy for the desorption of the ad-
sorbed precursor molecule becomes smaller than
the activation free energy for the formation of
HCl. As a result, the rate of desorption may in-
crease faster than the rate of HCl elimination as
the temperature is increased. High reactant pres-
sures can be used to increase the time-averaged
concentration of adsorbed precursors to shift
equilibriumtowardstheproducts.However,under
actual growthconditions,itislikelythatgas-sur-
face equilibrium is not attained, and that with a
highﬂowrateofgasesoverthesubstrate,reaction
by-products such as HCl are removed from the
chamberwithoutsubstantialreadsorbtionhelping
drive the reaction forward while moving the sys-
temawayfromequilibrium.Althoughequilibrium
is most likely not achieved under actual ﬂow
conditions, the shifts in equilibrium caused by
changes in temperature, pressures, and ﬂow rates
can be determined based on the potential energy
surfaceswehavereportedherein.
3.5. Reaction of ZrCl4 with multiple SiO2–OH/C3
surface sites
ThePESofthereactionofZrCl 4 withmultiple
surface sites is more complex because of the
branchingofreactionpathways.Fig.11showsthe
reactions of ZrCl4 with two surface Si–OH/C3
groups. Initally, the ZrCl4 molecule has two oxy-
gen lone-pair interactions with the two surface
hydroxyl groups (black line). The intermediate is
30.8kcal/molbelowtheentrancechannel,whichis
nearlydoublethe16.9kcal/molseenwithasingle
surfacehydroxylsite.Theactivationbarriertothe
formation of HCl is 25.8 kcal/mol relative to the
energy of the adsorbed intermediate. The HCl
productcanbeweaklyphysisorbedwithanenergy
thatis13.3kcal/molabovetheadsorbedcomplex,
andthedesorptionenergyforHClisendothermic
by3.5kcal/mol.
After the elimination of the ﬁrst HCl, the
reaction network can branch. One alternative
wouldbeforthezirconiumatomtoremain5-fold
coordinated (three bonds to Cl atoms and two
dative bonds from the surface hydroxyl groups)

11,blueline).Asinthepreviouscalculationswith
onlyonesurfacehydroxylgroup,watercanadsorb
via a lone-pair donation to the zirconium atom.
Formationofthisstablecomplexisexothermicby
17.9 kcal/mol. The transition state to the forma-
tionofHClhasanenergy19.5kcal/molrelativeto
theadsorbedstate,andthereactionisendothermic
by14.0kcal/molrelativetothecomplex.TheHCl
desorptionenergyis7.6kcal/moluphillrelativeto
the physisorbed state. Compared to the cluster
model with only one surface hydroxyl group, the
adsorbedcomplexandtransitionstateenergiesare
nearly identical. The physorbed HCl, however, is
approximately 3 kcal/mol more stable due to an
additionalinteractionwiththesecondsurfacehy-
droxylgroup.Thisleadstoaslightlymorestable
HCl physisorbed state and a higher HCl desorp-
tionenergy.
An alternative to the 5-fold coordinated water
half-reaction pathway would be for the surface
zirconiumatomtoeliminateasecondHClthrough
reaction with a surface hydroxyl group (Fig. 11,
green line). From the product of the ﬁrst HCl
elimination,thereisa16.8kcal/molbarriertothe

the desorption of the second HCl is endothermic
by4.0kcal/mol.Again,theenergiesofthecritical

From the product of the second HCl elimina-

(Fig.11,redline).Theadsorptionenergyofwater

kcal/mol above the adsorbed complex. The phys-
isorbedHClstateis19.2kcal/molabovethelone-

HClis2.7kcal/mol.

tion states and the adsorbed complexes, of the

ALD growth reactions are not aﬀected signiﬁ-
cantly by the interaction of the incoming ZrCl4
withmultiplesurfacehydroxylgroups.Themajor
diﬀerencesarethatfortheﬁrsthalf-reactionwhere
theﬁrstHCliseliminatedthesecondZr–Odative
bond shifts the exchange reaction PES down
approximately 14 kcal/mol, which decreases the
probabilityofprecursordesorption,andincreases
the barrier for the exchange reaction by 9.4 kcal/
mol relative to the adsorbed complex. However,
the stabilities of the intermediates and transition
statesfortwohalf-reactionsisincreasedwhenthe
coordination number of the zirconium atom of
the reacting precursor is increased by additional
interactions with surface sites, ligands, and other
adsorbing gas phase molecules. For example, for
the second half-reaction where –Cl is exchanged
with a –OH, the additional –Cl ligand shifts the
ligand-exchange reaction PES down approxi-
mately18kcal/molwhilethebarrierrelativetothe
complexisnearlyconstantat19.5kcal/mol.
3.6. Reaction of ZrCl4 with SiO2–OH/C3surface sites
on a 1-dimer cluster
ThePESofthereactionofZrCl 4 asshownabove
isnotsensitivetotheclustermodel.However,our
resultsdiﬀerfromthosepublishedpreviously[10].
Inthatwork,asimilarpathwayisexplored;how-
ever,therelativeenergiesarediﬀerent.Toreconcile
thediﬀerences,calculationsusingourmethodology
were performed on the silicon 1-dimer clusters
wherethetoplayerhasbeenoxidized.
For the initial adsorbed complex, we ﬁnd the
adsorption energy to be 15.0 kcal/mol. This is
weaker than we found previously using a pure
hydroxylated SiO2 surface (16.9–17.8 kcal/mol).
The diﬀerence likely arises from the geometric
constraintsusedinthe1-dimermodelcomparedto
the unconstrained SiO–OH/C3clusters. Jeloacia
foundtheadsorptionenergytobeonly10.0kcal/
mol. This diﬀerence of 5kcal/mol islikely dueto
diﬀerencesinclustergeometryandbasisset.
For the transition state energy, we ﬁnd the
barrier to be 15.1 kcal/mol above the adsorbed
state.Thetransitionstateislessthan0.5kcal/mol
away from the entrance channel as observed for
the unstrained clusters. Our barrier is lower than
the 20.1 kcal/mol barrier obtained by Jeloacia. If
thechoicesofclustergeometryandbasissetledto
systematic diﬀerences in relative energies, one
would expect a similar barrier; however, the dif-
ferencesappeartobeincreasing.Jeloaciausedan
iterative transition state search approach called
bond constraint relaxation (BCR) where the
reaction coordinate and non-reaction coordinate
degreesoffreedomarealternatelyoptimized.This
limitstheabilitytofullyexplorethepotentialen-
ergysurfaceofthesystemtolocatethetransition
state. The transition state search algorithm in
Gaussian simultaneously minimizes the energy of
the system while searching for a mathematical
ﬁrst-order saddle point with the negative fre-
quency corresponding to the reaction coordinate.
TheBCRtechniqueobtainsareactionbarrierthat
is an upper bound to the true value while the

4. Conclusions
The atomistic mechanism of growth of ﬁrst

usingZrCl4 andH2Oprecursorshasbeeninvesti-
gated.Thereactionpathwaysconsistoftwohalf-
cyclereactions:(1)ZrCl4 reactswiththeSiO 2–OH/C3

and(2)H 2OreactionswithSiO 2–O–ZrCl/C3surface

The reaction energetics of ZrO2 deposition on
hydroxylated SiO2 are qualitatively similar to the
energeticsofZrO 2 depositiononthegrowingZrO 2
ﬁlm and the energetics of ZrO2 deposition on
hydroxylatedSi.Theintermediatecomplexformed
byabsorptionofthegaseousprecursor,ZrCl4 and

mediatestate.Increasingthereactiontemperature
and pressure of the gaseous precursors shifts the
overall equilibrium from the stableabsorbed pre-
cursor state to the ﬁnal state. However, as in the
caseofthehomogeneousALDofZrO2,increasing
the temperature leads to desorption of precursor
andsubmonolayergrowth.Thereactionpathways
