Property Merging:
Merge SaturationBehavior in NucleationBehavior -> NucleationBehavior: this describes more effectively the saturation behavior, which is indicated by the type of nucleation

Property Grouping:
Precursor and co-reactant should belong to a group of: reactants

Missing Properties:
1. ALD Method
2. Material deposited

Adequacy of Descriptions:
deliveryMethod": "description": "Method of delivering the precursor to the chamber (e.g., vapor drawn, carrier gas assisted)", "enum": ["vapor drawn", "carrier gas assisted", "bubbling"] -> maybe this can be not mentioned. What can be mentioned instead is the type of carrier gas used.
