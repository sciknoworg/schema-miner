Property Merging:
ThicknessControl and Saturation -> ThicknessControl

Property Grouping:
-> ProcessParameters(Temperature, Pressure, PrecursorDosingTime, CoReactantExposureTime)
Describe the process parameters, the ones that are independent and affect the final film.

-> ThicknessControl (GPC, Film Thickness, NucleationBehavior)
Describe parameters that are affected by the film thickness

Missing Properties:
1. Material Deposited
2. ALD Method
3. Reactor
4. Pressure
5. Crystallinity
6. Film Density

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Stoichiometry -> Should be translated into concentration of reactants used (in the case of thermal ALD). The stoichiometry would make more sense in the ternary/quaternary materials in the cycle ratio.
GPC -> nm or nm/cycle
Co-reactor -> should be Co-reactant
