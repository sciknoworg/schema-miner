Property Merging:
ThicknessControl and Saturation -> ThicknessControl

Property Grouping:
In the material properties: include uniformity, conformality, chemical composition,
In the thickness control: include GPC, saturation and temperature dependence, since all these affect the thickness control

Missing Properties:
1. ALD Method
2. Material Deposited
3. DepositionTemperature
4. Pressure
5. Reactor
6. Crystallinity
7. Film Density

Adequacy of Descriptions:
-> Saturation: it is not a good term to describe this set of properties (times). It’s better if the purge/dose times are included in the Thickness Control set.
-> TemperatureDependence: that should be translated more into deposition temperature.
The search of the temperature dependency or the ALD window is another study. It is done in the initial stages of developing a process to identify the range of temperatures that should be used, where the GPC is stable.
It is more important to mention the deposition temperature range, which is assumed to be in the ALD window.
