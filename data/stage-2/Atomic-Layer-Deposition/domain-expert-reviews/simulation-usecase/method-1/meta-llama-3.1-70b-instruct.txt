Property Merging:
I think no merging is necessary. 

Property Grouping:
This grouping is more what I was trying to describe earlier, where each subset is asked about and then at the end the general question about methodologies is asked. My concern with this is whether the methodologies will be clearly matched with the parameters that they were used for in the case where a study has used multiple methods. 

Missing Properties:
It would be useful to know if this study was carried out purely with simulations or if it was a combination of simulation and experiment, and in this case which properties were found by which method.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Same problem with example methods where sub methods have been listed as methods, B3LYP is a functional within DFT. I am also slightly concerned whether the exclusive use of acronyms will cause issues.

There are some inaccuracies, like B3LYP being identified as a separate method (which should be a sub-section under DFT). But this could be easily fixed, and I canâ€™t blame Llama or GPT, while there are some 'experts' who cannot tell the difference. It managed to get the methodology as a separate property, and all other properties seem to be spot on, as are their labels, types, units and descriptions.
