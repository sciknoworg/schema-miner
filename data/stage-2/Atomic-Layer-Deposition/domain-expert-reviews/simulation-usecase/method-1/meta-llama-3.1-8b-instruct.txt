Property Merging:
I don’t think any merging is needed. 

Property Grouping:
Methods are seemingly only asked for in relation to the decomposition and binding, I think it would make more sense to either ask about methods in general separately or to repeatedly ask about methods for each subset of properties, because we are interested in the methodology used to study every parameter. Similarly, with observables, the fact that they can be observed in "real life" experiments doesn’t mean that they necessarily were, and if not then we still need to know how they simulated these properties.
Regarding this, for a more accurate classification, methodology part can be parsed, where usually there is a clearer distinction between the simulation and experimental parameters (and with minimal ‘contamination’ by results). Some commonly-used section titles are: computational methodology, computational/simulation details, DFT calculations, etc.

Missing Properties:
Missing, it would be useful to know if this study was carried out purely with simulations or if it was a combination of simulation and experiment, and in this case which properties were found by which method.
Some specific keywords, e.g. observed, calculated, predicted could be used to assign the source. Also missing discussion of materials involved. 

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Descriptions all make sense and are clear.

I think this gives overall a good classification of the data. There is no clear inaccuracies, apart from the computational methods being listed under the 'decompositionAndBinding' category under the simulation parameters property. 'decompositionAndBinding' essentially contains simulation results, so should be listed under a separate property.
