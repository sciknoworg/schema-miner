Property Merging and Grouping:
I think the grouping and merging are both okay, all the properties/groups are sensible.

Missing Properties:
- I think there could be more detail on the methodology, but it would most likely need to specific to be specific to the method, e.g. timestep for MD simulations or functionals for DFT and basis sets (if applicable, e.g. 6-31G(d,p), usually given after the method, following a '/' ).
- It would be useful to know if this study was carried out purely with simulations or if it was a combination of simulation and experiment, and in this case which properties were found by which method.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Property descriptions are all clear, although there are issues with the examples.

Some methods are listed incorrectly; some listed methods are actually subdivisions within other methods. e.g. B3LYP is a functional used within DFT, just the overall methods should be listed.

The required categories; very few papers will have covered all 5 categories, usually they focus either on small scale properties or larger scale reactor conditions etc.

I liked the idea of identifying the materials involved, there could be more precise categories, e.g. precursor, co-reactant, substrate, etc. Similarly, the 'surface properties', 'film properties' and 'reactor conditions' groups are quite spot on. But some specific points are off, e.g. velocity of substrate does not make much sense.
