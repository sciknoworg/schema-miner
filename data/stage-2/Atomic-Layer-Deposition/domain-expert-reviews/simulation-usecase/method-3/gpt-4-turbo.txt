Property Merging:
There are no obvious places where merging properties would help.

Property Grouping:
The groupings within simulation parameters is a little confusing, I think it would make more sense to have the parameters that are chosen as inputs (e.g. choice of material or method) separate from the results parameters (dependent variables e.g. chemisorption mechanism or growth rate).

Missing Properties:
It would be useful to know if this study was carried out purely with simulations or if it was a combination of simulation and experiment, and in this case which properties were found by which method.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
The description are all clear.

I think this one performs better in identifying the properties in general, while missing the example values in the description. And this one tends to merge the different reaction rate types into one property, with the group name of 'surfaceDesorption', which is inaccurate. 'observableProperties' and 'reactorDesign' classes seem to be very accurate. However, the 'simulationParameters' class is the least accurate, needs a lot of modifications.
