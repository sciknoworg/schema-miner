Property Merging:
I can't see anywhere where merging would help

Property Grouping:
Grouping is strange, one massive group "simulation parameters" with lots of sub sections most of which are not simulation parameters, It could be structured as inputs and outputs (as it has tried to do) but the input would need to be split in to methods, materials and properties such as temperature, and then the outputs (results) group would have the rates, the mechanisms, the interactions etc.

Missing Properties:
The methodology section has been removed completely

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Under Chemisorption there is a boolean property "TiOBondFormation" which is just one example of a bond which could be formed so I don't know why this has been singled out
