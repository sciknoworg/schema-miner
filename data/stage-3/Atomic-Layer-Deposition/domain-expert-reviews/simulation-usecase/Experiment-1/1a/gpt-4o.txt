Property Merging:
No merging necessary

Property Grouping:
Grouping is all sensible, I like the addition of the extra groups within methodology and materials to help describe the papers better.

Missing Properties:
No obvious omissions

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Mostly sensible, some of the more new properties are very specific which may be good or may be too much, hard to tell without seeing the schema in practice. (e.g. surface reactive sites within surface properties, this could be very useful from some papers but may start to give nonsensical answers from others I think)
2. Some of the given units are strange, atoms/second as a unit for rates is wrong, moles/second could be used for reaction rate but in this case I think it would be reported as a growth rate rather than reaction rate and therefore would be a distance/second unit (Angstroms/s). Similarly diffusion rate would be a distance measurement not atoms/second. Nm-2 for precursor density is wrong, densities are mass/volume. Kj/mol for binding affinity is not necessarily wrong but often eV is used rather than joules, eV/atom is probably more likely to be reported.
3. A lot of the new, quite specific additions have been added as Boolean values, I would be concerned about how useful the extracted info from these would be, a long list of yes or no answers may not be very helpful.
