Property Grouping:
1. Place the delivery method to both precursor and co-reactant property boxes.
2. Group: orientation with crystallinity under the crystallinity property in the film properties box
3. Group: growth rate with nucleation behavior and self-limiting growth in a separate property box outside of the film properties box under the name: growth behavior.
4. Group: dielectric constant, resistivity, carrier density, mobility under the name electrical properties box inside the film properties box.
5. Group: refractive index, absorption coefficient under the name optical properties box inside the film properties box
6. Gorup: reactor design, reactor type, manufacturer, name under the name Reactor in a property box outside of the deposition conditions box.
7. Place Pulse times (Dosing Times is better!) to the deposition conditions property box.
8. Place the delivery method property of the reactants in the reactor box.

Missing Properties:
1. Nitrogen impurity content
2. Crystallinity (if it is amorphous, crystalline etc.)
3. Nucleation Behavior, self limiting growth
4. Carrier Density, Mobility
5. Absorption coefficient
6. Reactor type, manufacturer, name
7. ALD Method
8. Chamber Pressure
9. Material Deposited
10. Bubbler Temperatures for reactants (if applicable for the co-reactant)
11. Elemental Composition of the film
12. Final thickness of the film

Adequacy of Descriptions
1. Description of schema: rename verifying to characterizing and remove the part: "for metal oxide films using various precursors and water"
2. Remove the airsensitivity, melting point and temperature range properties
3. Place the same properties for the precursor as well as for the co-reactant if applicable (meaning: name, vapor temperature) and also plasma properties if PEALD.
4. Rename Pulse times to Dosing Times.
5. Remove the Thermal Stability property.
6. Rename FilmThicknessUniformity to Uniformity
7. Remove adhesion property. Also you should not specifically mention materials and substrates like ITO, silicon, glass etc. This should be universally applied to all papers and processes you encounter.
8. Remove breakdown voltage property
9. Remove the optical bandgap property
10. Remove the adhesion to the substrate property box.
11. Make sure that the purge times have two entries: one for the precursor and one for the co-reactant.
12. Rename substrate temperature to deposition temperature
13. Remove the precursor temperature property
