Property Grouping:
1. Place precursorPulse length in the thickness control property box and rename it to : PrecursorDosing Time
2. Group: PrecursorName, ChemicalFormula, VaporPressure and DecompositionTemperature under the property name: Precursor inside the reactantsSelection box.
3. Group: coReactantName, ChemicalFormula,VaporPressure(ifapplicable), DecompositionTemperature(ifapplicable),PlasmaProperties(if applicable) under the property name: co-Reactant inside the reactantsSelection box.
4. Place uniformity and conformality in the Material Properties box.
5. Group: dosing

Missing Properties:
1. Nucleation Behavior: nucleation period and self-limiting growth. Include them in the growth behavior box.
2. Deposition Temperature, Chamber Pressure
3. Reactor (name, manufacturer, design, characteristics)
4. Density, Crystallinity, Roughness of the deposited film

Adequacy of Descriptions
1. Rename the description of the schema: "Schema for the ALD process, including process parameters and film properties"
2. Rename coReactor property to coReactant
3. Remove the melting point property.
4. Remove the TDMAT Reactor property box: the schema should be universal, therefore the names of the properties should have a generic character.
5. Remove the stoichiometry property.
6. Rename the thicknessControl to GrowthBehavior
7. Rename cycle time to Dosing Time. It should have two entries: one for the precursor and one for the co-reactant. Same for PurgingTime: two enties.
8. Remove the saturation property box
9. Remove the temperature dependence property box.
10. Remove the uniformity value property from the uniformity box. It could be more of a comment or conclusion based on the discussions on the findings on uniformity from the text, rather than a value.
11. Remove the conformality value property from the conformality box. It could be more of a comment or conclusion based on the discussions on the findings on conformality from the text, rather than a value.
12. Remove the nucleation behavior property box.
13. Remove the precursor consumption rate property
