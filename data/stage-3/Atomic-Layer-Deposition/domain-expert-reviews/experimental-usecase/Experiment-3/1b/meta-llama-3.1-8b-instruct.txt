Property Grouping:
1. Place reactant concentrations in the process conditions box
2. StructuralProperties (Uniformity, Conformality, Crystallinity, Density, Roughness)

Missing Properties:
1. Precursor and co-Reactant purging times.
2. Carrier Gas
3. Roughness

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Description for schema: rename parameters to conditions
2. Unit for pressure: Pa
3. Rename Co-reactant exposure time to co-ReactantDosingTime
4. Stoichiometry description refers more to the ratio of selected elements in the film
5. Remove the uniformity and conformality values
6. Rename ThicknessControl to GrowthBehaviour
