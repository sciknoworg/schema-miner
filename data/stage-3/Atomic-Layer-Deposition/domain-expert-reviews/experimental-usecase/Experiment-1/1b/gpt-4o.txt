Property Grouping:
1. Place bubblertemperature in the processparameters box
2. Place ALDMethod and MaterialDeposited in a single box called "ALDSystem"
3. Place reactor and substrate in the processpconditions box
4. Include the selflimitinggrowth and nucleation period properties in the cycledetails box (or thicknesscontrol box as I suggest later)
5. Merge: composition, thickness, uniformity, conformality, density, crystallinity properties into StructuralProperties box inside the film properties box.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. CarrierGas: should be out of the precursor property and belong in the general reactants box.
2. Description of nucleationperiod: number of cycles required to achieve self-limitation.
3. Remove the ligandRelease and reactivity property
4. Rename the processconditions property to processparameters
5. Rename cycledetails property to thicknesscontrol
