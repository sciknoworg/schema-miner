Property Grouping:
1. Dosing and Purging time properties: should be for both the precursor and the co-reactant, therefore corresponding to two entries per property.
2. Remove the temperaturerange from the thicknesscontrol. This is more of a processparameter.
3. Place the crystallinity and film density properties from the processconditions box to the materialproperties box

Missing Properties:
1. Name and manufacturer of the reactor in the reactor property.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Description of the schema: "..verifying an ALD process", it's not "verifying" more of: characterizing an ALD process and deposited film
2. Description of DeliveryMethod: it should also mention the co-reactant apart from the precursor delivery.
3. Description of the materialproperties box: remove the "…including uniformity and conformality."
4. Description of the refractive index: remove the "…typically between 2.08 and 2.10." the range is different, do not specify any value.
5. Description of the resistivity: remove the "e.g., 12 \u00b5\u03a9-cm for a 110-nm thick platinum film."
6. Rename ProcessConditions to ProcessParameters
