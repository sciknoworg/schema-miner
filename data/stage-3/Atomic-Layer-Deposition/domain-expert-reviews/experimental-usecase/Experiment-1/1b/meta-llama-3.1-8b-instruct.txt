Property Grouping:
1. Group: chemical composition, film density, crystallinity, conformality, uniformity in  StructuralProperties group which is included in the FilmProperties box.

Missing Properties:
1. Purging time of precursor and co-reactant in the processparameters box

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Remove the saturation property box. It repeat properties already mentioned.
2. Remove the stoichiometry property box 
3. Remove the uniformity property in the uniformity box. Just keep the thickness variation.
4. Remove the conformality property in the conformality box. Just keep the aspect ration property.
5. Remove the nucleation behavior property.
6. Rename MaterialProperties to FilmProperties
