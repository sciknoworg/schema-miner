Missing Properties:
1. Reactor: Name, Manufacturer, Characteristics(dimensions etc.)
2. Roughness

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Remove PulseTime
2. Describe a bit more what the nucleationBehavior is: include the saturation, self limiting terms.
3. Remove the stoichiometry property.
4. Rename optical to Optical Properties
5. Rename electrical to Electrical Properties
6. Remove uniformity inside the uniformity property box
7. Remove conformality inside the conformality property box
