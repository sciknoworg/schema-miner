Property Grouping:
1. Remove the processControl and make it ThicknessControl property group
2. Remove the otherAspects property outside of the materialProperties group. It refers to the general ALD method, not the material itself.

Missing Properties:
1. ALD method
2. MaterialDeposited
3. Deposition temperature and pressure
4. Crystallinity, Roughness

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Description of schema: instead of verifying write characterizing. Also remove this "for various metal nitrides and oxides using metal amide precursors" because it refers to a specific ALD process.
2. Description of co-reactant: It can also be plasma apart from a chemical.
3. Description of delivery method: It can also refer to the co-reactant in the case of thermal ALD.
4. Purging Time: this time refers to both coreactant and precursor. It should have two input values.
