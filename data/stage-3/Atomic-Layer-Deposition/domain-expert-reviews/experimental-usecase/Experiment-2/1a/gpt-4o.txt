Property Grouping:
1. Include PulseLength in the processproperties property box
2. Place CarrierGas outside of the precursor box but inside the reactants box, because it can refer to both co-reactant and precursor
3. In the reactor property box, include name of the reactor and the manufacturer
4. Group AnnealingTemperature and AnnealingAtmosphere in AnnealingConditions property box
5. Include chemicalcomposition and stoichiometry properties in the structuralproperies box
6. Place bandgap in the electrical properties box and remove the optical description
7. Include dielectricconstant in the electrical properties box
8. Include the impurityContent in the structural properties box
9. Include AnnealingConditions  in the FilmProperties box

Missing Properties:
1. Dosing and purging times for co-reactant and precursor

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Title: Should be more of: Methods and results for the deposition of a film through a specific ALD process
2. Remove the reactivity from the precursor property box
3. Description of coReactant Vapor Pressure: “"Vapor pressure of the co-reactant in Torr."’: insert if applicable
4. Remove the CounterReactant property
5. Remove the DepositionRate property
6. Remove SurfaceIntermediates, LigandRelease and adsorptionSites properties
7. Remove EffectivePermittivity
8. Remove the min and max values in the refractiveindex property
