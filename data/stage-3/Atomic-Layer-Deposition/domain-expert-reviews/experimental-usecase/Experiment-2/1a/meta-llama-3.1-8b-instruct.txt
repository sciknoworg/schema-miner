Property Grouping:
1. The temperature and pressure properties from the reactor box can be moved inside the ALD method box and the reactor property box can be removed completely.
2. Place the reactant concentration, reactant temperature, vapor pressure inside each reactant (precursor and co-reactant). Since these describe the reactants it is better if this information is merged inside the reactant property box.

Missing Properties:
1. Reactor name, manufacturer, dimensions
2. ALD method used

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. coReactor: change the name to coReactant
2. Description of Temperature: change it to "Temperature of the Reactants". Should have two input values, in the case the process is Thermal ALD.
3. Same for the VaporPressure description
4. Rename pulseLength to Dosing Time. It should have two entries: one for precursor and one for co-reactant
5. Remove the "TDMATReaction" and "NHReaction". These are referring to a specific ALD process, while the main point of the schema is to be adapted to many different ALD systems. Maybe it can be respectively renamed to : "PrecursorReaction", "Co-reactantReaction" to have more universal character. Inside these property boxes there will be Dosing Time and Purging time. In that case the previously mentioned PulseLength property should be removed.
6. Remove the reactantSelection. It's repeating the previous data about precursor and co-reactant
7. Remove the precursordosingtime and coreactantexposuretime, and purg time from the reactor property box. These properties are repeated again within the same schema.
8. Remove the stoichiometry property box
9. Rename optical to OpticalProperties
10. Rename electrical to ElectricalProperties
11. Remove the uniformity property inside the bigger uniformity property. The thickness variation property is enough to describe the uniformity.
12. Remove the conformality value property. The AspectVCheRatio is enough for this
13. Description of crystallinity: "Film crystallinity"
