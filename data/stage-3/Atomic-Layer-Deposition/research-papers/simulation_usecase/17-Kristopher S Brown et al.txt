ABSTRACT: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical layer
deposition (CLD) are techniques to produce conformal, atomically
precise overcoats for materials in gas and liquid phases, respectively.
Although it is a challenge to explicitly model ALD/CLD dynamics
because of the large timescales involved, a combination of rule-
based deposition actions, followed by molecular dynamics
relaxations, can capture the net eﬀect of one cycle. For ALD, we
developed deposition rules for the trimethylaluminum (TMA)/H2O
system over Al2O3 and SiO2 substrates. We also explore the CLD
system of Al(O-sec-Bu)3/H2O solvated in 2-butanol over an Al2O3
substrate. In contrast to previous studies focusing on ligand
exchange reactions, the gas-phase simulations predict that a TMA
dissociation mechanism is the dominant growth mode, whereas the CLD simulations show a primary growth mode of deposition
through precipitation of species that have already undergone reactions in solution. Together, these modeling results constitute a
reﬁnement of preexisting ALD models, leading to more accurate growth rate predictions, as well as aﬁrst step toward modeling
more challenging liquid-phase processes.
1. INTRODUCTION
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique for depositing
thin ﬁlms, capable of producing uniform and conformal
overcoats with atomically precise control over the ﬁlm
thickness and composition. 1−3 The ﬁlm growth proceeds
through alternating self-terminating heterogeneous reactions
above a solid substrate. These characteristics make ALD useful
for several applications in the ﬁelds of microelectronics,
catalysis, and energy conversion, storage, and utilization.2,4−6
Catalyst overcoating by deposition of a metal oxide layer is a
promising method to curtail irreversible deactivation. Several
overcoating methods have been shown to protect metal
nanoparticles against sintering and leaching. These methods
include the use of ALD of alumina7,8 and silica deposition by
sol−gel.9,10
ALD processes consist of sequential alternating gas-phase
pulses of chemical precursors that react with the substrate. Each
sequential gas-surface reactions is referred to as a“half cycle”,
during which excess precursor is pulsed into a chamber under
reduced pressure for enough time to allow saturation of the
substrate surface through a self-limiting process. Subsequently,
unreacted precursor or reaction byproducts are eliminated by
purging with an inert carrier. Because of the self-limiting nature
of the reaction, the two half cycles leave no more than one
monolayer of the material at the surface. This process is then
cycled until the appropriateﬁlm thickness is achieved.11
Among several ALD processes, the deposition of aluminum
oxide, Al2O3, using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water as
precursors, is the most studied ALD process to date and is
considered as a model process for ALD.1 This is mainly due to
the ideally self-terminating nature of the adsorption process and
the inertness of methanethe reaction’s by-product. More-
over, ALD’s production of aluminum oxide, which is a high-k
dielectric material, is also of great interest for micro-
electronics.12
Common gas-phase deposition techniques have limitations
which can be addressed by carrying out ALD chemistry in the
liquid phase. These limitations include the restricted types of
precursors and their byproducts that must be gaseous at feasible
temperatures and the requirement of near-vacuum conditions.12
Furthermore, in the case of coating 3D substrates, a specialized
equipment is required, such asﬂuidized bed reactors to ensure
diﬀusion of precursors into substrate pores. Liquid-phase
synthesis techniques can mimic the gas-phase process at near
room temperatures using a simple wet chemistry equipment by
sequentially exposing a substrate to stoichiometric amounts of
the metal and liquid precursors or by using an excess of
precursors with the washing/drying step in between each
cycle.13−17

The network of elementary reactions is far more complex,
and numerous studies have examined the reaction details.1,18−20
Despite the widespread use of ALD, the details of its physical
and chemical processes are not yet well-understood and
continue to be the focus of both experimental and numerical
studies.21 Experimentally researchers improve the deposited
ﬁlms by adjusting operating conditions, such as process
pressure, temperature, and dosage.22−25 Recently, advances in
computing technologies have allowed studying physical
interactions and chemical kinetics of ALD by numerical
approaches.
ALD is intrinsically a multiscale process because it is manifest
across many length and time scales, 21,26 and the primary
challenge to model ALD is to eﬀectively combine diﬀerent
scales according to the property of interest. Indeed, the pulsed
ﬂow of gases into meter-scale reactors, around millimeter-scaled
geometries, leads to chemical reactions between atoms, which
aggregate into nanometer-thickﬁlms and coat micrometer-
scaled pores or particles. The problem of timescale in ALD is
perhaps even more acute than that of length scale because a
combination of fast (picoseconds−nanoseconds) and slow
reactions (microseconds−milliseconds) contributes to theﬁlm
growth, and the pressure changes as gases are pulsed and
purged over second-long timescales.
On the molecular scale, most numerical investigations adopt
ﬁrst-principles methods, such as density functional theory
(DFT), to explore surface reaction mechanisms and chemical
reaction pathways.20,27 These atomic-level models reveal certain
microscopic details of the surface reaction mechanisms and
chemical kinetics but fail to account for the multiscale nature of
ALD and are not directly applicable to engineering applications.
Other researchers take the macroscopic transport processes
into consideration, using Monte Carlo methods, lattice
Boltzmann methods, and molecular dynamics (MD). Kinetic
Monte Carlo (KMC) is an approach that combines reaction
events with diﬀerent timescales to reveal the evolution of the
overall process in time. The lattice KMC (LKMC) method was
successfully applied to the modeling of Hf(N(CH3)2)4/H2O
ALD.28 The LKMC method requires the complete knowledge
of reaction pathways, as well as their rate constants, which can
be calculated ab initio from transition-state theory and DFT.
The KMC algorithm uses this information to simulate the
system evolution by randomly executing events at all timescales,
with event probabilities proportional to their rate constants. Hu
et al.29 presented an alternative strategy that employs classical
MD. MD alone cannot model entire ALD cycles because of the
limited simulation timescales for large systems, so Hu et al.
bypassed this timescale limitation by coupling MD with a set of
deposition rules.
Deposition rules can be described as a function that accepts
an uncoated surface as input and returns an approximated
coated surface as output. MD relaxation steps correct these
approximations to produce a realistic surface structure, which
serves as the input into the deposition rules of the next cycle.
An inherent advantage of the MD method is found in its lack of
lattice constraints, allowing it to better represent amorphous
structures. Overall, the combination of MD with rule-based
deposition makes a favorable compromise between the
computationally intensive explicit modeling of the deposition
process with the overly simpliﬁed modeling of ALD at a
macroscopic scale. We extend the previous work by Hu et al.29
in this direction by adding more complexity to the rule-based
process, allowing us to explore most of the possible chemical
mechanisms and modes of growth.
1.2. Liquid-Phase Technique.Motivated by the challenge
to develop a practical synthesis technique for creating catalysts
resistant to sintering, poisoning, and leaching, we recently
developed a deposition process involving Al(O-sec-Bu)/H2O
solvated in 2-butanol, which has a chemistry similar to the
traditional TMA/H2O process.30 Here, as an initial attempt to
model the liquid-phase chemistry, our simulations will focus on
modeling this particular system. Because of the absence of a
purging step in this batch liquid-phase process, stoichiometric
amounts of precursor are added to each half cycle to achieve
monolayer coverage and to prevent unwanted side reactions
and uncontrolled growth. Experimentally, there is a large
parameter space to explore, including the quantities of
precursor injected per cycle, temperature, and the choice of
precursors, substrate, and solvent. There are multiple outputs of
interest that may vary nonmonotonically with respect to these
inputs, including growth rate, roughness, andﬁlm density. To
completely explore this space through experiments is
challenging, thus we wanted toﬁrst identify interesting regimes
via modeling the liquid-phase chemical layer deposition (CLD)
process. This is also, to our knowledge, theﬁrst attempt of
modeling liquid-phase deposition and as such could have many
implications beyond our system of interest.
The aim of this work is to both improve our understanding
of the mechanism of the traditional gas-phase alumina ALD
process and further extend the model to analyze a liquid-phase
layer-by-layer overcoating process relevant to heterogeneous
catalysis. In this work, we identify the importance of a
dissociation mechanism for TMA deposition on alumina in gas-
phase ALD and the importance of the precipitation deposition
mechanism in the case of liquid-phase overcoating.
2. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
2.1. Rule-Based Appr oximation Phase. All major
reaction pathways considered in this work for the TMA/H2O
process are presented in Figure 1. The deposition rules are
informed by mechanistic studies of the TMA/H 2O proc-
ess.1,20,31−34 These works show common pathways, despite
often studying diﬀerent surface models with diﬀerent methods.
There is a general agreement about the favorability of the ligand
exchange reaction (LER) R1 on hydroxylated surfaces (Figure
1), and R2 was found to directly follow in most studies. Shirazi
and Elliott33 found that the subsequent LER, R3, was made
favorable through a cooperative eﬀect from the neighboring
Me2 or Me1 surface species. Other studies did not include any
cooperative eﬀect, although there is a disagreement about
whether the precursor passes through the planar intermediate
Me1,34 in contrast to directly forming the tetrahedral product of
R4, Me 1″.20 R5 was found to be approximately neutral
energetically, with a high activation energy, ranging from 1.0
to 1.6 eV, leaving Me1 as the kinetically favored product of
LERs.31−33 R6 and R7 are alternatives to R2 and R4, in the case
where no hydroxyl groups are nearby.20,32 Many studies that
consider bare or partially hydroxylated surfaces acknowledge

that TMA can adsorb to oxygen bridges.20,32−34 From here, the
precursor can irreversibly dissociate into three methyl frag-
ments via R7. Other pathways have been proposed, such as
those that model adsorbed H2O and TMA coordinated with
bridge oxygens,32 but these were not explicitly treated in this
study.
In contrast to studies that use ﬁxed surfaces, any set of
deposition rules, including ours, must accept arbitrary surface
atom coordinates and deﬁne rules that describe which reactions
can happen. However, simple information on particular
interatomic distances and angles is not suﬃcient to generally
establish in which range of distances and angles the reactions
are favored. In the absence of these additional data, a bridging
distance parameter was introduced so that hydroxyl groups
within this distance are deemed eligible for a LER (R2 + R3 or
R4 + R5). This distance parameter was selected to be 3.5 Å,
based on a transition-state structure for R2 identiﬁed by
Weckman and Laasonen31 (see calculation in section S1 of the
Supporting Information).
The deposition rules attempt to produce a plausible ﬁnal
state, rather than depict a rigorous sequence of events that lead
to theﬁnal state. Thus, the stable bridged species Me 2′ is
directly formed when a precursor is deposited onto an
unhindered hydroxyl with a neighbor within the bridging
distance, rather than passing through intermediate states.
Because of uncertainty in the relative reaction rates of the
dissociation and LERs, the rules alternate attempts at the two
types of reaction. Miniature MD relaxations are performed
when a surface is apparently saturated, and a surface is deemed
saturated if the miniature MD relaxation does not lead to any
further addition. The system is represented by a list of species
in the gas phase or in solution and a list of surface atoms (Si, Al,
O, H, and ligand) with their coordinates. Precursor ligands are
approximated as large single pseudo-atoms. The precursor
addition rules and their sequence are shown inFigure 2.
Precursor addition involves evenly sampling from potential
structures that maintain the structure’s geometry (Figure 1). A
precursor addition is deemed successful if there exists a
structure with no hard sphere overlap. If multiple successful
structures are found, the structure closest to their average is
chosen. Dissociation reactions target bare alumina and bridge
oxygen sites.
The hydrolysis half cycle is assumed to behave ideally,
resulting in the hydrolysis of every ligand present on the
Figure 1. TMA reaction pathways (adapted from Travis and
Adomaitis34).

surface, with no dissociation of water onto bare alumina.
Experimentally, this is validated by C impurities detected at
molar concentrations on the order of 1%.35 After the second
half cycle, a 200 ps MD relaxation is performed before
beginning the subsequent cycle.
2.2. MD Relaxation Phase.MD relaxations are invoked to
produce a realistic equilibrium surface after an approximate
surface has been generated from the deposition rules (Figure
2). The MD relaxation phase is governed by a Buckingham-
type pair potential (eq 3), originally developed to treat crystals
and melts of alumina and silica.36

This potential was expanded to treat hydroxylated surfaces of
alumina and silica.37 Stiﬀ harmonic bonds were used to keep
ligands at a ﬁxed distance while allowing them freedom of
motion. An interaction potential for the ligand pseudo-atoms
was developed such that they would not overlap with other
atoms. This is accomplished with a purely repulsive Lennard-
Jones potential with a cutoﬀ at its minimum value. The
parameters for these potential functions are found in Tables S1
and S2 in the section S2 of theSupporting Information.
Simulations were carried out using an NVT ensemble in a
simulation box with periodic boundaries along x and y
directions.38 Full relaxations lasted 200 ps with a 0.5 fs
timestep and sampling taken over a 100 ps period. A two-
dimensional correction was applied to the Ewald summation of
Coulombic forces. A Nosé−Hoover thermostat was imple-
mented, maintaining a temperature of 450 K. The cutoﬀ for
Buckingham interactions was 8 Å, and the cutoﬀ for Coulombic
interactions was 13 Å. An artiﬁcial force beginning 5 Å above
the surface repelled any molecules that might break free from
the surface and attempt to escape the simulation box. This force
was modeled as a harmonic spring acting purely in the vertical
dimension. Simulations were performed using the MD package,
LAMMPS, and results were visualized using OVITO.38,39
The initial alumina surface model was prepared by annealing
an alumina model after replacing random Al atoms with H
atoms, as described in Hu et al.29 The surface had 2265 atoms,
6% H, a surface −OH density of 2.1 OH nm −2, and the
simulation box had dimensionsa = b = 36.8964 Å andc = 70.0
Å, including a vacuum space of 50 Å above the surface. A
hydroxylated silica model prepared by Sandupatla et al.40 with 5
OH nm−2 was relaxed for 300 ps under the Matsui potential
before being used in MD simulations.
2.3. Liquid-Phase Implementation.The consequences of
possibly adding insuﬃcient or excess precursors due to the
batch conﬁguration of the liquid-phase experiments required
additions to the gas-phase model. In particular, a list had to be
used to keep track of the species in solution. The equilibration
routine had to analyze the list of species in the solution and the
surface and terminated only when no reactions were possible.
The species and reactions that were considered are presented in
Tables 1and 2.
The gas-phase ALD model contains four classes of species:
*L, *OH, H2O, and AlL3 (where L =−CH3 in the gas-phase
model and−O-sec-Bu in the liquid-phase model). In the liquid-
phase CLD case, the possibility of excess precursor reacting
with H2O in solution leads to a partially hydrolyzed precursor,
which could further react to form oligomers. Thus, the partially
hydrolyzed precursor and the oligomerized precursor were new
species for the liquid-phase model, with the former allowed to
participate in surface ligand exchange. Although the oligomers
could form separate particles, it was assumed that they could
precipitate onto the surface of the growingﬁlm. This was
modeled by a precipitation parameter. This ﬁnal assumption
was supported by experiments, where no free alumina was
observed at the end of the synthesis.30
The possibility of multiple reactions being possible at once
raises important questions of kinetics and mass transfer. In the
absence of this information, we treated all reactions as equally
likely, with the equilibration process consisting of random
selection of pairs of reactive species, reacting when the rules
permitted it, until no more reactions were possible.
As mentioned, the precipitate could deposit onto the surface.
This was done by constructing a plausible molecule, giving an
atomic composition, and orienting it in a random direction at a
random point on the surface. In reality, the rate of this process
is a function of many unknown concentrations, reaction rates,
and mass-transfer coeﬃcients. We approximated this process
using a single unknown factor, expressed as a probability of
precipitation per cycle (referred to above as the precipitation
parameter).
The last addition to the liquid-phase model was a
representation of solvent molecules during the MD relaxation.
After a half reaction had reached equilibrium, the MD
relaxation phase was preceded byﬁlling the simulation box
with randomly oriented solvent molecules (sec-butanol) up to
the experimental density (Figure 3). A repulsive-only harmonic
spring wall was placed 15 Å above the surface to bound the
motion of solvent molecules. Forceﬁelds for both the solvent
interactions and the interface interactions were taken from
Jorgensen et al.41 and Johnston et al., 42 respectively. An
example of diﬀerent phases of CLD simulation is presented in
Figure 3.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Atomistic Simulation of the TMA/H 2OA L D
Process. The ﬁrst case study we modeled was the growth of
TMA/H2O over a hydroxylated alumina surface at room
temperature. Predicted growth and roughness per cycle are
plotted inFigure 4as a function of the ALD cycle. The results
are compared to those of Hu et al., which studied the same
physical system,29 and to the experimentally observed growth
rate, that is, between 0.9 and 1.1 Å/cycle 43 (yellow zone)
(Figure 4A). The increased growth per cycle that we predict
relative to Hu et al.29 was largely a consequence of introducing
the dissociation reaction and more closely matched exper-
imental values, suggesting that the dissociation reaction may be
an important inclusion to correctly predict experimental results.
Our trend for surface roughness is similar to that of Hu et al.29
as it increased with the number of cycles, which was suggestive
of the island-growth mode (Figure 4B).
Similarly to Hu et al.,29 our initial surface has a lower surface
OH density than typical ALD conditions. 44 However, over
multiple cycles, this value increases until it reached a stable
value of 4.5 OH nm−2. By monitoring how the deposition
changes over multiple cycles, it was possible to reproduce
several experimental trends, including the number of aluminum
atoms added (Figure 5A) or the ratio of aluminum atoms

added to ligands added for a given surface OH density (Figure
5B).
Figure 6 shows predicted Al2O3 coating growth on alumina
and silica represented as the number of Al atoms added to the
substrate. The simulations over silica are compared to the
experimental silica ALD results of Delabie et al. 47 The
predicted growth over alumina is compared to the expected
cycle-by-cycle growth data of alumina that was obtained by
using the surface OH density with the empirical relation given
by Puurunen45,46 (see Figure 5A). A characteristic diﬀerence in
coating a silica substrate compared to alumina was the initial
decrease in deposited aluminum, followed by a gradual increase.
This trend is explained by Delabie et al.47 as a consequence of
the inability for Si−CH3 bonds to be hydrolyzed, creating an
inert surface area after the ﬁrst half cycle. As the ratio of
aluminum to silicon atoms on the surface gradually increases
after further ALD cycles, the inert fraction of the surface
decreases and the growth rate increases. However, our inclusion
of a silica surface model that forbade the hydrolysis of Si−CH3
bonds led to a very limited decrease over theﬁrst two cycles
that was not as pronounced as the experimental trend measured
by Delabie et al.,47 suggesting that other eﬀects are perhaps at
play.
Ligand size was found to have a large impact on the growth
rate. Increasing the ligand radius from 2.0 to 2.4 Å, consistent
with using a triethylaluminum precursor, led to a decrease in
the growth rate from approximately 1.0 to 0.6 Å/cycle, with no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the surface roughness.
Sensitivity to the bridging distance parameter was also
investigated; however, no signiﬁcant deviations in any model
outputs were observed between tests at 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 Å. This
speaks to the relative dominance of the dissociation reaction,
which is not impacted by the bridging parameter, at the low
surface OH concentrations tested in this study. This is in
agreement with previous reports as the dominance of
dissociation at low and moderate surface OH concentrations
has been predicted by Travis and Adomaitis34 and exper-
imentally suggested by Guerra-Nuñez et al.48
3.2. Atomistic Simulation of the Liquid-Phase CLD.As
mentioned above, the case study developed for liquid-phase
simulation was the Al(O-sec-Bu)3/H2O process solvated insec-
butanol, recently developed by Héroguel et al.30
A signiﬁcant portion of the CLD was found to come from the
precipitation mechanism, rather than the traditional ALD
pathway. This is evidenced by a lack of sensitivity to the ligand
size, which the gas-phase model is very sensitive to. This
growth mode leads to rough surfaceﬁlms with high porosity
(Figure 3 ), relative to the analogous ALD case (see
comparisons in Figure 7).
The model revealed that growth rates are sensitive to the
input stoichiometry (Figure 8). In particular, the growth and
roughness can be multiplied by 10 by decreasing the amount of
water injected per cycle. This is understood as using a
“nonideal” ratio of precursors to encourage the precipitate
deposition growth mode, evidenced by the signiﬁcant increase
in roughness. The CLD overcoat obtained experimentally30
shows much greater porosity than ALD overcoats, which is also
qualitatively captured by the model. Given the very limited
number of studies using simulations to predict liquid-phase
sol−gel chemistry, these results that predict similar trends to
those observed experimentally demonstrate that such eﬀorts
could serve as a tool to guide experimentalists during thin-ﬁlm
synthesis in solution.
4. CONCLUSIONS
We have successfully expanded a simulation method for
modeling ALD involving the combination of an empirical,
rule-based deposition approach with a MD relaxation step. This
method is a simpler alternative to the LKMC strategy, which
requires an intensive DFT investigation to fully characterize all
types of possible changes in atomic coordinates. By
incorporating several recently reported mechanistic features
for the TMA/H2O process into our ALD modeling algorithm,
we improved the ability of the model to predict several

variables. Importantly, a stable growth rate on alumina of
approximately 1.0 Å/cycle at 450 K was predicted, successfully
reproducing experimental results. Furthermore, we expanded
our approach to modeling liquid-phase thin-ﬁlm deposition,
which is of growing importance in the sol −gel chemistry
research. Our ability to qualitatively predict trends between
input variables (e.g., stoichiometry) andﬁlm growth or
roughness suggests that this model can help guide future
experimental design.
