Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising material for electronics due to its hardness, and ability to carry
high currents and high operating temperature. SiC ﬁlms are currently deposited using chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) at high temperatures 1500–1600/C14 C. However, there is a need to deposit
SiC-based ﬁlms on the surface of high aspect ratio features at low temperatures. One of the most
precise thin ﬁlm deposition techniques on high-aspect-ratio surfaces that operates at low tempera-
tures is atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, there are currently no known methods for ALD
of SiC. Herein, the authors present a ﬁrst-principles thermodynamic analysis so as to screen differ-
ent precursor combinations for SiC thin ﬁlms. The authors do this by calculating the Gibbs energy
DG of the reaction using density functional theory and including the effects of pressure and temper-
ature. This theoretical model was validated for existing chemical reactions in CVD of SiC at
1000 /C14 C. The precursors disilane (Si2H6), silane (SiH4), or monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl) with ethyne
(C2H2), carbontetrachloride (CCl4), or trichloromethane (CHCl3) were predicted to be the most
promising for ALD of SiC at 400/C14 C. VC 2016 American Vacuum Society.

I. INTRODUCTION
Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising material for elec-
tronic devices. It is harder than Si and can sustain higher vol-
tages, carry higher currents, and operate at higher
temperatures. There is a need to deposit SiC-based ﬁlms on
the surface of high aspect ratio features for various applica-
tions for electronics, e.g., low-k spacers/liners and air gap
liners for interlayer dielectric, exploiting the low dielectric
constant (<5) and low wet etch rate of SiC.
SiC occurs naturally in different crystal polytypes. The
most common polytypes being developed for electronics are
3C, 4H, and 6H.1
SiC-based ﬁlms are currently deposited using chemical
vapor deposition (CVD). This technique is operated at ele-
vated temperatures 1500–1600/C14 C and may suffer from non-
uniformity due to fast surface reactions.2 One of the most
precise thin ﬁlm growth techniques is a variant of CVD
called atomic layer deposition (ALD). Thin ﬁlms deposited
by ALD or plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) are highly con-
formal even on high-aspect-ratio surfaces and are grown at
low temperatures (e.g.,<400 /C14 C). However, there are cur-
rently no known low temperature methods for ALD of SiC.
The most commonly used precursors in SiC CVD growth
are silane (SiH4)3–5 as a silicon precursor, and propane
(C3H8)3,5–8 or ethylene (C2H4)9,10 as a carbon precursor.11
They provide a better morphology and higher growth rate than
other precursors.12 However, many different precursors apart
from those mentioned above were used for CVD of SiC. Nine
different carbon precursors [methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6),
ethyne (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), propane (C3H8), propene
(C3H6), propadiene (C3H4), propyne (C3H4), butane (C4H10)]
with silane (SiH4) were analyzed by Hallinet al.4 for the
CVD growth of 4H and 6H SiC epitaxial layers, in the tem-
perature range of 1550–1600/C14 C. The most stable growth at
high growth rates was achieved with propane (C3H8).4 For
silicon precursors besides silane (SiH4) the most commonly
used are chlorosilanes, such as dichlorosilane SiH 2Cl2
(DCS),5 trichlorosilane SiHCl3 (TCS),9 methyltrichlorosilane
SiCH3Cl3 (MTS),13 and tetrachlorosilane SiCl4 (TET).14 TET
and TCS are the most common.12 Ar e v i e wo fc h l o r i d e - b a s e d
CVD growth of SiC was done by Pedersenet al.15 Single-
source precursors (containing both Si and C in the same mole-
cule) have also been used for CVD of SiC.16 These precursors
include: MTS, methylsilane (CH3–SiH3),17 diethylmethylsilane
[(C2H5)2SiHCH3],18 tetramethylsilane [Si(CH3)4],19 hexame-
thyldisilane [Si2(CH3)6],19 silacyclobutane [SiH2(CH2)3],20 and
1,3-disilabutane (SiH3–CH2–SiH2–CH3).16
As was mentioned above, experimentalists are facing difﬁ-
culties in growing SiC ﬁlms by ALD or PEALD. Theoretical
modeling of ALD using density functional theory (DFT) pro-
vides a complementary view to the experimental techniques.
DFT is usually used to calculate the pathways for precursor
adsorption, ligand migration, and by-product formation on the
surface, yielding reaction energies and activation energies for
each step of the ALD cycle. A review of previous theoretical
studies of Si-based materials can be found in Ref.21.I nt h i s

TURBOMOLE (Ref. 22)a n dVASP (Ref. 23) software. The effects
of CVD conditions (1000/C14 C) and ALD conditions (400/C14 C)
are evaluated. It is found that chemical reactions of disilane
(Si2H6), silane (SiH4), monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl), or DCS
(SiH2Cl2) precursors with all suggested carbon precursors are
thermodynamically favorable. The most negativeDG are for
disilane (Si2H6), silane (SiH4), monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl),
ethyne (C2H2), carbontetrachloride (CCl4), and trichlorome-
thane (CHCl3). Hence, silane (SiH4), disilane (Si2H6), mono-
chlorosilane (SiH3Cl), ethyne (C 2H2), carbontetrachloride
(CCl4), and trichloromethane (CHCl3) can be predicted to be
the most favorable precursors for ALD of SiC thin ﬁlms.
II. METHODOLOGY
Atomic-scale modeling was performed to investigate
routes toward the ALD of SiC-based ﬁlms using ﬁrst princi-
ples calculations based on DFT. All precursors were modeled
as isolated molecules in vacuum using theTURBOMOLE soft-
ware.22 Optimized structures of the Si and C precursors are
shown in Fig.1. The generalized gradient approximation to
DFT (Ref.24) was implemented by using the exchange corre-
lation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).24
The atom-centered basis set def2-TZVPP was used for all the
atoms25 along with an auxiliary basis set for the density within
the resolution of identity (RI) approximation.26,27
The energy for SiC-3C bulk was obtained using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)23 also with the
PBE exchange-correlation functional. The projector aug-
mented wave method23,28 was used to describe the core elec-
trons of atoms. A plane wave basis set with a cut-off energy
400 eV was used for the valence orbitals. An 8/C2 8 /C2 8k -
point grid within the Monkhorst–Pack scheme in the
Brillioun zone was employed. Full geometry relaxation was
carried out using the conjugate gradient method for energy
minimization at convergence level of 0.01 eV/˚A on each ion.
Reaction energetics for SiC from various silicon and car-
bon precursors were evaluated using the general formula in
Eq.(1), assuming that by-products of the reactions were
CH4, HCl, Cl2, and H2 where applicable. Competing reac-
tions to formation of SiC are not considered.

For example, for SiCl4 (X ¼ Cl, a ¼1, b ¼4) and C2H6
(Y ¼ H, n ¼ 2, m ¼6), Eq.(1) becomes
2SiCl4 þ C2H6 ! 2SiC þ 6HCl þ Cl2: (2)
A list of all the analyzed reactions is presented in Tables I
and II in supplementary material.33
Gibbs energies DG were calculated for these reactions
using Eq.(3)
DG ¼ DE /C0 TDS þ RTlnQ; (3)
where DE ¼ PEproducts /C0 PEreactants using ground state ener-
gies obtained from DFT calculations,DS are entropies at tem-
perature T obtained from DFT calculations in TURBOMOLE,
assuming thatSSiC ¼0, and reaction quotientQ ¼ QPl

reactants, where partial pressures of products arePproducts
¼ 0.01 Torr, partial pressures of reactantsPreactants¼1T o r r a n d
l are stoichiometric coefﬁcients. Partial pressures were chosen
in correspondence with experimental ALD data.DG indicates
whether a reaction is thermodynamically favorable.
In VASP, the one-electron orbitals are expressed in plane
wave basis sets, which make it inefﬁcient and time-
consuming for calculating gas-phase molecules, while bulk
SiC can be easily simulated withVASP. Therefore, we use a
reference gas-phase molecule to estimate energies for bulk
SiC inTURBOMOLE. We choose gas-phase tetramethylsilane
Si(CH3)4 as a reference molecule for SiC. It contains Si–C
bonds like SiC. FirstDE1 is computed withVASP for decom-
position of the reference molecule using Eq.(4)
SiðCH3Þ4ðgÞ! SiCðsÞþ 3CH4ðgÞ: (4)
Calculations for Si(CH3)4(g) and CH4(g) molecules were
done at singleC-point in the Brillioun zone at convergence
level for the forces on each ion of 0.01 eV/˚A. The size of the
cell was chosen as 15/C2 15 /C2 15 ˚A. DE1 is calculated only
once. Then,DE2 is computed for the gas-phase reaction to the
reference molecule withTURBOMOLE for each X and Y using

In the example above, Eq.(5) becomes
2SiCl4ðgÞþ C2H6ðgÞþ 6CH4ðgÞ! 2SiðCH3Þ4ðgÞ
þ 6HClðgÞþ Cl2ðgÞ: (6)
The ﬁnal correctedDE3 that we use for calculating Gibbs
energy DG in Eq. (3) will be a sum ofDE2 and DE1. This
approach can be represented as a Hess cycle; see Fig.2 for
the example of 2SiCl4 þ C2H6 ! 2SiC þ6HCl þ Cl2. The
difference between DE computed in VASP and in TURBOMOLE
for this sample reaction of Eq.(6) is just 0.0002 eV, well
within the precision of the method.
Including the effects of temperature allowed us to vali-
date the approach for known precursor combinations for
CVD at 1000/C14 C. Furthermore, reaction energetics were cal-
culated at 400/C14 C to predict precursors for ALD of SiC at
around this temperature.
DG [A(g) þB(g) ! AB(s) þ C(g)] reﬂects the actual
thermodynamics of the CVD reaction. IfDG < 0, the reac-
tion is permitted andDG > 0 means that it is not permitted.

Kinetics is less important at highT. By contrast, in an ALD
process, reactants A(g) and B(g) do not meet in the reactor,
but DG [A(g) þB(g) ! AB(s) þ C(g)] is still relevant for
describing the ALD process. Our ﬁnding so far with ALD
has been that the formation of A-B bonds in the solid product
is the main driving force for the process (and that the forma-
tion of by-product C plays a secondary role). The Aþ B reac-
tion is thus a way of measuring this driving force.21 The actual
surface reaction steps in each ALD cycle are (1) unknown for
SiC, (2) expected to be quite complex, and (3) dependent on
kinetics of each step (because ALD is performed at lowerT
than CVD). It is therefore not possible to screen a wide range
of chemicals for their actual detailed behavior in ALD.
Instead, we use the simpleDG model. However, we bear in
mind that the absolute value ofDG has no meaning for the
ALD reaction, i.e.,DG > 0 does not necessarily mean that
ALD will not work andDG < 0 does not necessarily mean
that all the individual surface reactions take place.
Therefore, the same gas-phase reactions were used to
investigate ALD and CVD processes. In both cases, a surface
was not introduced in the model.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Different Si and C precursors for ALD of SiC were
screened with respect to their thermodynamic reactivity

toward forming SiC. Gibbs energiesDG of chemical reac-
tions between different Si and C precursors were calculated
to investigate which chemical reactions are more thermody-
namically favorable (Figs.3 and 4 and Tables I and II in sup-
plementary material). First, Gibbs energies were calculated
at CVD conditions T ¼ 1000 /C14 C and partial pressures
Pproducts ¼ 0.01 Torr and Preactants ¼1 Torr of products and
reactants, respectively, to validate the proposed theoretical
model for screening (see Fig.3, Table I supplementary mate-
rial). AtT ¼ 1000 /C14 C, DG is negative for reactions of disilane
(Si2H6), silane (SiH4), monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl), DCS, and
TCS with all the analyzed carbon containing precursors.
That corresponds very well with experimental results, where
silane is the most common silicon precursor for SiC
CVD.3–5 Monochlorosilane together with propane (C3H8)
gave a growth rate of SiC of 20lm/h (Ref.8) and, consistent
with this, the calculatedDG for monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl)
and propane is negative (DG ¼/C0 3.3 eV/SiC). Besides, for
CVD of SiC using DCS with propane growth rates up to
100 lm/h were achieved at 1750 /C14 C,5 where we estimate
DG ¼/C0 4.8 eV for DCS reacting with propane at 1750/C14 C.
The most positiveDG are computed for reactions of TET
and tetraﬂuorosilane (SiF4). For tetraﬂuorosilane (SiF4), DG
is positive for reactions with all suggested carbon precursors
and is also positive for TET with ethylene, propene, -2-
butene, propyne, and carbon tetrachloride. In the experiment,
TET together with TCS are the most commonly used chloro-
silane precursors for CVD of SiC.15 The use of TET with
hexane (C6H14) for epitaxial growth of 6H-SiC was demon-
strated at 1850 /C14 C with a growth rate of 3.6–7.2 lm/h.29
Propane was also used with TET at high temperatures up to
1850 /C14 C yielding growth rates up to 200lm/h.30 Our model
shows near-zero exothermicity for TET reacting with pro-
pane and hexane at 1000/C14 C( DG /C0 0.3 and 0.0 eV, respec-
tively), but much more negative values at 1850/C14 C( /C0 2.9 and
/C0 2.6 eV, respectively, not shown in the tables), correspond-
ing very well with the experimental ﬁnding.
Experimentally, SiC ﬁlms were grown by CVD using
TCS and ethylene (C2H4) precursors with a growth rate of
100 lm/h at 1600/C14 C.9 Our calculations found TCS reacting
with all of the carbon precursors to be thermodynamically
favorable.
The above data include the effects of pressure via the
RTlnQ term of Eq.(3). We ﬁnd that this is important: in gen-
eral, including the effects of pressure makes the reactions
more thermodynamically favorable, as seen inDG becoming
more negative by an average of 0.6 eV/SiC atT ¼ 1000 /C14 C
and by 0.3 eV/SiC atT ¼400 /C14 C.
It is also important to include the effects of entropy. The
above data include the effects of entropy viaTDS. Including
TDS makes the reactions more thermodynamically favorable
by decreasing DG by an average of 1.3 eV/SiC for
T ¼ 1000 /C14 C and 1.0 eV/SiC forT ¼ 400 /C14 C depending on the
size of the molecules. For example, for small C2H2 reacting
with different silicon precursors, including TDS decreased
DG by an average of 0.1 eV/SiC forT ¼1000 /C14 C and 0.2 eV/
SiC for T ¼ 400 /C14 C, while for the bigger molecule C6H14
including TDS decreased DG by an average of 1.8 eV/SiC
for T ¼ 1000 /C14 C and 1.2 eV/SiC forT ¼400 /C14 C.
To evaluate the viability of these precursors for ALD of
SiC, Gibbs energiesDG at T ¼ 400 /C14 C and partial pressures
Pproducts ¼ 0.01 Torr and Preactants ¼1 Torr of products and
reactants, respectively, were calculated and are presented in
Fig. 4 and Table II in supplementary material. In general, we
can see that most of the reactions are less favorable at this
lowerT, compared to DG at higher T presented in Fig. 3,
which may be one reason why ALD of SiC is difﬁcult.
Nevertheless, direct chemical reactions of disilane (Si2H6),
silane (SiH4), monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl), or DCS Si precur-
sors with all suggested carbon precursors are thermodynami-
cally favorable which suggests that these precursor
combinations may give viable indirect reactions in ALD.
The most negative DG are for ethyne (C2H2), carbontetra-
chloride (CCl4), and trichloromethane (CHCl3).

Eq. (3).

A quite different process for low temperature silicon car-
bide ALD was proposed by Thompson using silicontetra-
chloride and trimethylaluminium as precursors. 31 We
postulated that the corresponding chemical reaction is
3SiCl4 þAl(CH3)3 ! 3SiC þ AlCl3 þ 9HCl and found that
DG for this reaction at 400/C14 Ci s /C0 0.54 eV per SiC. This is
of the same magnitude asDG for the other ALD processes
that we have computed to be viable and thus provides further
validation for our approach.
To assess single-source precursors, the thermodynamics of
their decomposition into SiC and by-products was calculated
at T ¼400/C14 Ca n dT ¼1000/C14 C. The corresponding DG are
presented in Fig.5 and in the supplementary material. We ﬁnd
that unimolecular decomposition of most of these precursors is
thermodynamically favorable at low temperature. The most
negative DG are for decomposition of diisopropylaminosilane
[DIPAS, SiH3N(iPr)2] and silacyclobutane [SiH2(CH2)3]. The
most positiveDG is for dichlorosilacyclobutane [SiCl2(CH2)3].
Experimentally, growth of SiC by CVD using single-
source precursors was shown for 1,3-disilabutane
(SiH3–CH2–SiH2–CH3) (low pressure CVD, 750/C14 C),16 silacy-
clobutane [SiH2(CH2)3]( T ¼800–1200/C14 C),20 methylsilane
(CH3–SiH3)( T ¼800 /C14 C),17 and MTS (T ¼1570 /C14 C).32 Our
calculations show that decomposition of 1,3-disilabutane, sila-
cyclobutane, and methylsilane is thermodynamically favor-
able atT ¼1000 /C14 Cw i t hDG ¼/C0 3.5, /C0 4.5, and/C0 3.8 eV/SiC,
respectively. For decomposition of the MTS precursor, we
obtained negative DG ¼/C0 1.8 eV/SiC at 1000 /C14 C.
Experimentally, it was shown that growth of SiC using MTS
is favorable only at 1570/C14 C. Indeed our theoretical estimation
of the Gibbs energy for MTS at 1570 /C14 C gives negative
DG ¼/C0 3.4 eV/SiC. This shows that our theoretical results
correspond to experimental studies in all of the cases.
Unimolecular decomposition is undesirable as a reaction
strategy for ALD because it does not allow surface reactions
to self-limit. It is therefore important to check whether pro-
posed ALD precursors can decompose and lead to non-ALD
growth. The data in Fig.5 show that the precursors that are
the most resistant toward decomposing at 400/C14 C are dichlor-
osilacyclobutane [SiCl2(CH2)3] and MTS withDG ¼ 0.9 and
0.2 eV/SiC, respectively. On the other hand, the precursors
silacyclobutane [SiH2(CH2)3] and DIPAS are the most likely
to decompose at 400/C14 C.
In conclusion, we carried out a theoretical thermody-
namic analysis of different precursor combinations for SiC
thin ﬁlm by calculating Gibbs energyDG, including
the effects of pressure and temperature ( G ¼ DE /C0 TDS
þRTlnQ). The theoretical model was validated for existing
chemical reactions in CVD of SiC process at 1000/C14 C and
partial pressures Pproducts ¼ 0.01 Torr andPreactants ¼1 Torr.
In all of the cases, our theoretical results correspond to
experimental studies. For ALD of SiC at 400/C14 C and
FIG. 4. (Color online) Gibbs energiesDG for reactions of various Si and C precursors at ALD temperature 400/C14 C. The most favorable reactions are those with
the most negativeDG. The least favorable reactions have the most positiveDG. Silane (SiH4), disilane (Si2H6), monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl), ethyne (C2H2),
carbontetrachloride (CCl4), and trichloromethane (CHCl3) are predicted to be the most favorable precursors for ALD of SiC thin ﬁlms.

ilane (Si2H6), silane (SiH4) or monochlorosilane (SiH3Cl)
with ethyne (C2H2), carbontetrachloride (CCl4), or trichloro-
