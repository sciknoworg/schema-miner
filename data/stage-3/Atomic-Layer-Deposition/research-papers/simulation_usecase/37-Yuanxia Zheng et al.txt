ABSTRACT: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has matured
into a preeminent thinﬁlm deposition technique by oﬀering a
highly scalable and economic route to integrate chemically
dissimilar materials with excellent thickness control down to
the subnanometer regime. Contrary to its extensive
applications, a quantitative and comprehensive understanding
of the reaction processes seems intangible. Complex and
manifold reaction pathways are possible, which are strongly
aﬀected by the surface chemical state. Here, we report a
combined modeling and experimental approach utilizing ReaxFF reactive forceﬁeld simulation and in situ real-time spectroscopic
ellipsometry to gain insights into the ALD process of Al2O3 from trimethylaluminum and water on hydrogenated and oxidized
Ge(100) surfaces. We deciphered the origin for the diﬀerent peculiarities during initial ALD cycles for the deposition on both
surfaces. While the simulations predicted a nucleation delay for hydrogenated Ge(100), a self-cleaning eﬀect was discovered on
oxidized Ge(100) surfaces and resulted in an intermixed Al2O3/GeOx layer that eﬀectively suppressed oxygen diﬀusion into Ge.
In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry in combination with ex situ atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
conﬁrmed these simulation results. Electrical impedance characterizations evidenced the critical role of the intermixed Al2O3/
GeOx layer to achieve electrically well-behaved dielectric/Ge interfaces with low interface trap density. The combined approach
can be generalized to comprehend the deposition and reaction kinetics of other ALD precursors and surface chemistry, which
oﬀers a path toward a theory-aided rational design of ALD processes at a molecular level.

■ INTRODUCTION
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has become an important
synthesis technique in various ﬁelds of nanotechnology, e.g.
semiconductor processing and microelectronics,1−6 biomedical
applications,7−9 and protective coatings. 10−19 Compared to
other thinﬁlm deposition techniques, ALD has a unique set of
advantages: (i) atomic scale control ofﬁlm thickness, (ii) high
conformity on structures with high aspect ratios, (iii)
deposition of continuous and pinhole-free layers, (iv) low
process temperatures, and (v) excellent scalability due to low
cost and large area deposition. 2,10 Considering the large
application space in diverse technological areas, it seems
surprising that relatively little is known quantitatively about the
kinetic processes in ALD at an atomic level. Optimizing
deposition conditions is simple, inexpensive, fast, and
straightforward. A qualitative understanding of the processes
at play is suﬃcient for rapid process development. On the other
hand, it has proven challenging to obtain a theoretical
description with suﬃcient details at reasonable computational
costs to realistically model the processes occurring at the
surface during deposition such as adsorption/desorption,
diﬀusion, and chemical reactions of molecular species.
Rapid advances in semiconductor processing technology
require a better comprehension of ALD processes to advance
the technology, master the increasing complexity level, and
therefore accelerate optimization cycles. The currently
employed strategy toward ever eﬃcient computing hardware
is continuing miniaturization along with functional diversiﬁca-
tion, which requires the integration of more materials at the
nanoscale with potentially dissimilar and incompatible chem-
istries. Achieving this will require the capability of predicting
experimental outcomes and a quantitative understanding of
ALD processes beyond simple trial and error optimization.
Even simple changes of materials in complex processﬂows are
becoming a challenging task such as replacing Si with high
mobility semiconductors like germanium (Ge) or III −V

compounds as the channel materials in complementary metal-
oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistor technology. Here,
ALD is used to integrate an ultrathin dielectricﬁlm as a gate
dielectric to electrically modulate the channel conductivity in a
ﬁeld eﬀect transistor by an electric potential applied to the gate.
The resultant device charact eristics are governed by a
combination of the quality of the dielectric and the electrical
properties of the dielectric/semiconductor interface. However,
due to the lack of atomic scale understanding of ALD growth
kinetics on the semiconductor surface, the roadmap to obtain
highly scaled and electrically reliable gate stacks is not
straightforward.2 In the case of Ge, it has been found that a
direct ALD of high permittivity (high k) dielectric on a Ge
surface results in poor electrical characteristics dominated by
the trap response formed at the dielectric/semiconductor
interface.20−25 To address this challenge, the introduction of an
ultrathin interlayer that forms an electrically well-behaved
interface with Ge was proposed. This layer is thin enough to
still allow competitive capacitance density scaling and yet thick
enough to avoid trap formation through chemical reaction
mechanisms between the highk and Ge.26−28 Various materials
and deposition conditions were applied and resulted in
noticeable improvements, but details of the dominant
mechanisms for the ALD processes at the atomic scale and
how they can be utilized to improveﬁlm nucleation and surface
passivation still remain unclear.
In this work, we report a co mbined theoretical and
experimental approach to gain insights into the complex ALD
process using ReaxFF reactive forceﬁeld simulations29 and in
situ real-time spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The ALD
deposition kinetics of Al2O3 on hydrogenated and oxidized
Ge surfaces were investigated to quantify the inﬂuence of initial
surface chemical states on the reaction kinetics and relate it to
the trap formation during ALD nucleation. ReaxFF nudged
elastic band (NEB) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
were performed to directly model the deposition process; in
particular, the adsorption and decomposition of ALD
precursors along with desorption and di ﬀusion of products
formed. The simulations were correlated with in situ SE
measurements taken in real time during ALD growth along
with ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
atomic force microscopy (AFM). Metal-oxide-semiconductor
capacitor (MOSCap) devices were fabricated to quantify the
electrical characteristics of dielectric/Ge interfaces using
impedance spectroscopy and were correlated to the surface
chemistry and nucleation mechanism.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. P−Ge(100) substrates (Ga-doping, resistivity = 1.0−5.0
Ω·cm) were supplied by Umicore Electrooptic Materials. Tetrakis
(dimethylamino) hafnium (TDMAH, 99%) and trimethylaluminum
(TMA, 98%) precursors were purchased from Strem Chemicals, Inc.
High purity water (H2O) precursor was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich.
Preparation of Ni/HfO2/Al2O3/GeOx/Ge MOSCap Devices.P−
Ge(100) substrates were precleaned by acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and
deionized water rinses. The precleaned substrates were immediately
transferred into the load-lock of the ALD system (ALD-150LX, Kurt J.
Lesker Co.) for vacuum transfer. In situ surface treatment and ALD
deposition processes were performed in the ALD reactor at 270°C
with a background Ar pressure of 1.2−1.5 Torr controlled by in situ
spectroscopic ellipsometry. The hydrogenated Ge surface (Ge:H) was
prepared by exposing the precleaned Ge surface to a RF H2/Ar plasma
(30 s, 100 W, H2:Ar = 3:117 sccm). The GeO x/Ge surface was
prepared by exposing the Ge:H surface to O2/Ar plasma pulses (1.75
s/pulse, 125 W, O2:Ar = 3:117 sccm). Al2O3 was grown by ALD using
TMA and H 2O as precursors. HfO 2 was grown by ALD using
TDMAH and H2O as precursors. After ALD depositions, all samples
were completely cooled to room temperature under vacuum before
transferring to any other processing or measurements. Sixty nanome-
ters of Ni was deposited by thermal evaporation as the gate electrode
with a pattern deﬁned by a shadow mask. All MOSCap devices were
postannealed in forming gas (pH2:pAr ≈ 20:1200 mTorr) at 330°C for
10 min.
Characterizations. ALD processes were monitored in real time by
in situ M-2000U spectroscopic ellipsometer (λ = 240−1000 nm, J.A.
Woollam Co.). The incident angle of light beam was 71° with respect
to the sample surface. AFM images were obtained using Bruker
Dimension Icon. XPS results were measured using Kratos Analytical
Axis Ultra with an Al Kα source. AFM and XPS measurements were
performed immediately after transferring samples out of the ALD
chamber to minimize the air exposure. Electrical impedance
measurements were carried out on a Cascade probe station (Summit
11000). An LCR meter (Hewlett-Packard 4285A) was used for
measuring capacitance−voltage (C−V) characteristics; a combination
of DC and AC voltage was used with an AC amplitude of 50 mV and a
frequency f = 75 kHz to 1.5 MHz. A parameter analyzer (Keithley
4200-SCS) was used for measuring leakage−voltage (JG−V) character-
istics.
■ THEORETICAL BASIS
The ReaxFF reactive force ﬁelds were optimized against
quantum mechanics-based training sets.30 A LAMMPS code
(version 28, June 2014,http://lammps.sandia.gov) was used31
in ReaxFF-MD simulations. A time step of 0.25 fs was used to
ensure the chemical reactions at given temperatures (300−1000
K in MD simulations), while the system temperatures were
controlled by the NVT ensemble using the Nose-Hoover
thermostat with a damping constant of 25 fs. All of the reaction
proﬁles were evaluated by ReaxFF-NEB calculations32 using
standalone ReaxFF code; the initial andﬁnal structures of each
NEB calculation were fully relaxed, and then 4−6 intermediate
structures were generated. All of the system conﬁgurations were
displayed by the Molden (version 5.0)33 and VMD (version
1.9.2)34 software.
A ReaxFF reactive forceﬁeld for Ge/Al/C/H/O interactions
was used in the simulation of TMA/H2O ALD process on the
Ge(100):H and GeO x/Ge(100) surfaces (see Supporting
Information for more details about the forceﬁeld development
and validation). The starting surfaces were described by the
following slab models: (a) 40× 40 × 11 Å for the Ge(100):H
slab and (b) 40× 40 × 20 Å for the GeOx/Ge(100) slab (see
Supporting Information for more details about the system
description). The ReaxFF-MD simulations were performed
inside orthogonal simulation boxes of 40× 40 × 50 Å for
Ge(100):H and 40× 40 × 80 Å for GeOx/Ge(100). Relatively
high temperatures [500 K for Ge(100):H and 1000 K for
GeOx/Ge(100)] were used in the ReaxFF-MD simulations to
accelerate reaction speed within the limited time scale (∼ ns)
due to the computational costs.35 TMA or H2O dose was
realized by randomly distributing 80 TMA or H2O molecules
into the system; after a suﬃcient relaxation (500 ps), a removal
of all gas phase molecules mimicked the purge step in ALD.
Particularly in the case of GeOx/Ge(100), double TMA doses
were used prior to H2O dose in the simulation to ensure a
saturated reaction.
The ReaxFF-MD simulations of oxygen di ﬀusion from
GeOx/Ge(100) and (Al2O3/GeOx)/Ge(100) interfaces were
performed inside an orthogonal simulation box of 20× 20 × 60

Å (see Supporting Information for more details about the
system description). The system temperature was kept at 300
K, while a higher temperature (800 K) was assigned to O atoms
to accelerate the O diﬀusion within the limited time frame (2.0
ns).
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Al2O3 ALD on Hydrogenated Ge Surface. A ReaxFF
model for Ge/Al/C/H/O interactions was developed to
simulate the reactions of trimethyl-aluminum [Al(CH3)3,
TMA] and water (H 2O) with hydrogenated Ge surfaces
(Ge:H). Details for the calculation and validation of the
employed ReaxFF forceﬁelds are available in theSupporting
Information.
The reaction proﬁles for TMA and H2O adsorption with a
hydrogenated Ge(100) [Ge(100):H] surface were determined
from ReaxFF-NEB calculations (Figures 1 a and b). Both
proﬁles indicate that a fully hydrogenated Ge surface is
chemically inert when exposed to TMA or H2O. In Figure 1a,
the TMA molecule approaches a H-termination surface site
(physisorption) and then forms a chemical bond (chemisorp-
tion) that is accompanied by a H atom transfer from the surface
to a methyl (−CH3) group of TMA. An Al−Ge bond is formed,
and a methane (CH4) molecule is liberated from TMA as
byproduct. The reaction is overall exothermic (energy gainΔE
= −1.09 eV) but hampered by the large barrier (Ea = 1.41 eV)
at the physisorption stage.
In contrast, H 2O adsorption on the Ge:H surface is
endothermic ( Figure 1 b). H 2O physisorption is likely to
occur on Ge:H surfaces due to the strong polar characteristic of
H2O, but the energy gain ofΔE = −0.58 eV is comparable to
the evaporation energy of H2O (0.42 eV), so the physisorption
is limited by the thermal desorption at elevated temperatures
used in real ALD processes (T = 270 °C in our experiments).
Moreover, the subsequent hydroxylation of the Ge:H surface to
form Ge−OH* is strongly inhibited by the high reaction barrier
(2.32 eV); therefore, a pronounced nucleation delay of ALD
Al2O3 on Ge:H is expected.
The TMA nucleation process on Ge:H is dramatically
accelerated if a partially hydrogenated Ge surface, i.e. a high
density of dangling bond sites (Ge−*), is present (Figure 1c).
The chemisorption of TMA on a local Ge −* site is
energetically favored (ΔE = −0.82 eV), and a Ge−Al bond is
formed. The chemisorbed TMA molecule now favorably aﬀects
the dehydrogenation of an adjacent Ge−H* site through the
formation of a dimethyl-aluminum group [-Al(CH3)2*, DMA]
and release of a methane (CH4) molecule. Overall the reaction
is highly exothermic (−1.74 eV) and preserves the number of
dangling bond sites available for the subsequent TMA
adsorption (see ReaxFF-MD simulations at an elevated
temperature T = 500 K in the Supporting Information ).
Thus, the nucleation dynamics are governed by the density of
Ge−* sites. Additional ReaxFF simulations on Ge:H surfaces
were performed to explore the origin of dangling bond sites.
Details for parametrizing initial structures are given in the
Supporting Information. The simulations showed that rather
than surface H-dissociation, Ge−* sites originate from surface
Hd iﬀusion into the subsurface interstitial sites. This diﬀusion
shows a moderate activation energy (Ea = 0.68 eV) and a small
overall energy ( ΔE = 0.39 eV), which can be partially
compensated by the increased entropy contribution to the
free energy at elevated temperatures in a real ALD environ-
ment. The ReaxFF-MD simulation of annealing a Ge:H surface
at 800 K revealed up to 0.3/nm2 of Ge−* site formation,
corresponding to ∼4% of all surface sites.
T h ep r e s e n c eo fs u r f a c eD M As i t e s[ G e−Al(CH3)2*]
enabled the adsorption of H2O and resulted in a typical two-
step oxidation reaction,36 shown inFigures 2a and b. An Al−O
bond (−1.71 eV) is initially formed, and a H atom is transferred
to a−CH3 ligand, thus liberating a CH4 molecule and leaving a
partially hydroxylated surface site Ge−Al(CH3)(OH)*. A fully
hydroxylated surface site Ge−Al(OH)2* is formed upon further
exposure to H2O. The ReaxFF-MD simulation atT = 500 K
conﬁrmed the preferential H2O adsorption on DMA surface
sites (seeSupporting Information). An oversupply of H2O does
not result in additional reactions, reﬂecting the self-limiting
nature of ALD.
Subsequently supplied TMA molecules are either chem-
isorbed at the new Ge−* dangling bond site formed in close
proximity, resulting in lateral growth, or directly at Ge −
Al(OH)2*, resulting in vertical growth.36 In Figure 2c, a slightly
higher reaction barrier (0.18 eV) is found for the exothermic
TMA adsorption on Ge−Al(OH)2* compared to that found on
the Ge−* site (0.079 eV). However, both reaction barriers are
small enough so that both lateral and vertical growths will occur
by oversupplying TMA.
Three major consequences of Al2O3 ALD on Ge:H can be
derived from the ReaxFF results. First, a pronounced ALD
nucleation delay is expected along with an island growth mode
due to the chemical inertness of Ge:H. Second, Al−Ge bonds

are formed during TMA adsorption which give rise to a high
interface trap density (Dit) inside the Ge band gap.37 Third, the
nonconformity of the nucleation process and the associated
island formation cause nonuniform regions in theﬁlm where
Al2O3 islands merge at the coalescence layer thickness.2 These
nonuniform regions can act as leakage paths when theﬁlm is
used as a gate dielectric.38 It is therefore expected that a direct
Al2O3 deposition on Ge:H will result in inferior electrical
characteristics of dielectric/Ge interface in the application in
ﬁeld eﬀect transistors.39
To experimentally conﬁrm the ReaxFF predictions, in situ SE
experiments were performed during the Al 2O3 ALD on
Ge(100):H (Figure 3a). The Al 2O3 thickness during ALD
was extracted in real time by ﬁtting the SE spectra using a
layered model of Al2O3/Ge. Details about SE modeling are
given in the Supporting Information. The inset of Figure 3a
shows the SE response to sequential doses of TMA and H2O
separated by purge cycles. Each ALD cycle starts with a TMA
pulse (blue arrow), and the resultant change in surface optical
properties is reﬂected as a nominal increase of Al2O3 thickness.
The TMA adsorption on the surface saturates due to the self-
limiting nature of ALD. The amplitude of the nominal
thickness increase corresponds to the amount of TMA
adsorption. After purging, an H2O dose (red arrow inFigure
3a inset) removes the surface methyl (−CH3) groups10 and is
reﬂected as a nominal thickness decrease. The net thickness
change at the end of each ALD cycle provides the growth per
cycle (GPC).
The experiments were in excellent agreement with the
predicted nucleation delay on Ge:H surfaces, as revealed by the
nonlinearity of ALD growth. InFigure 3b, the trends of TMA
adsorption (red circles) and GPC (blue squares) are compared
to the Al2O3 ALD baseline (deposition on Al2O3 surface; see
Supporting Information). The TMA adsorption on Ge:H is low
in the ﬁrst cycle, ∼17% of the baseline, corresponding to a
coverage density of∼0.5/nm2 (see Supporting Informationfor
calculation details). Assuming TMA adsorption occurs only at
Ge−* sites, this density is comparable to the above-mentioned
ReaxFF result of ∼0.3/nm2. In subsequent cycles, the TMA
adsorption is still well below the baseline. This suggests that the
creation of new Ge−* sites driven either by H diﬀusion or
TMA adsorption is a slow process. The adsorption level
gradually approaches the baseline within 25−27 cycles. The
nucleation is strongly inhibited for theﬁrst few cycles but then
improved due to an increased Al2O3 surface coverage through
lateral expansion from initial nucleation sites as implied by
ReaxFF simulations. Consequently, the growth rate or GPC
(blue squares inFigure 3b) is proportional to the TMA
adsorption and also lower than the baseline of 0.86 Å (see
Supporting Information). The island growth mode was
conﬁrmed by ex situ AFM measurements (Figure 3c). The
surface roughness, indicated by the root-mean-square (RMS)
and maximum surface corrugation, signiﬁcantly increases with
the number of ALD cycles during the nucleation delay.
Al2O3 ALD on GeO x/Ge(100) Surface. ReaxFF simu-
lations for Al2O3 ALD (TMA + H2O) were performed on
oxidized Ge surfaces to further explore the inﬂuence of surface
chemistry on the ALD nucleation behavior. A slab of Ge(100)
terminated by 5 Å of amorphous GeOx was used as the starting
surface (see Supporting Information for constructing the
model).
Figure 4a shows the snapshots of ReaxFF MD simulations
for the ﬁrst and second TMA doses and a subsequent H2O
dose. In contrast to the Ge:H surface, a pronounced TMA
absorption occurs on GeOx/Ge in the ﬁrst TMA dose,
consumes most of TMA molecules (80 in total), and results
in a conformal overlayer. The Al atom in the TMA molecule

directly attaches to the surface O sites and forms Al−O bonds
so only Ge−O and Al−O bonds are present. ReaxFF NEB
calculation (Figure 4b) reveals that TMA chemisorption onto
GeOx surfaces is highly reactive with no reaction barrier and
strongly exothermic ( −3.02 eV). Upon the ﬁrst TMA
adsorption, abundant volatile byproducts like methane (CH4)
and ethane (C2H6) are formed despite any H2O. This implies
that TMA is highly oxidized during the chemisorption. The
oxidant was found to be GeOx through an analysis of chemical
states of GeOx during TMA adsorption (Figure 4c). While Ge4+
is the dominant oxidation state of the initial GeOx surface layer,
the exposure to TMA reduces the average oxygen coordination,
rendering Ge3+ the dominant oxidation state. This strong redox
reaction in the absence of any H2O “cleans” the Ge surface
from GeOx.40 Note that the TMA cleaning mechanism on Ge is
diﬀerent from the ligand-exchange mechanism on III −V
surfaces.41−44 On III−V, the O atoms in native oxides directly
exchange with the−CH3 groups in TMA, which results in the
methylation of the native oxides and forms volatile byproducts.
On Ge, a similar ligand-exchange mechanism was also observed
in our simulation but in a much lower degree and resulted only
in a small amount of nonvolatile−Ge(CH3)x* surface species
with x <4 .
After the ﬁrst TMA dose, fewer GeOx surface adsorption
sites are available, i.e. the surface tends to saturate. In the
second TMA dose, fewer TMA molecules adsorb (Figure 4a),
and the change in the Ge oxidation state is smaller (Figure 4c).
Note that in the second TMA dose snapshot ofFigure 4a, Al
atoms more deeply di ﬀuse into the GeO x, resulting in an
intermixed amorphous (Al2O3/GeOx) layer. The driving force
of intermixing is attributed to the aforementioned self-cleaning
eﬀect. In the subsequent snapshot, the H 2Od o s e( 8 0
molecules) hydroxylates−CH4 groups located at the outermost
surface and forms volatile CH4 molecules. At this point, the
fully oxidized Al atoms have less driving force to diﬀuse into the
GeOx sublayer. By tracking the O atoms during the ReaxFF
MD simulations, it was found that over 90% of O atoms
bonded to Al originated from GeOx, with the rest contributed
by H2O. This O atom tracking con ﬁrms the direct redox
reaction between TMA and GeOx.
The formation of an (Al2O3/GeOx) intermixed layer was
found beneﬁcial to limit oxygen diﬀusion from the oxide into
the underlying Ge crystal, as revealed by the ReaxFF MD
simulations inFigure 5. A GeOx/Ge(100) structure capped
with an Al2O3 layer was annealed atT = 800 K for 2 ns (Figure
5a), and the same process was performed on a simple GeOx/
Ge(100) structure for comparison ( Figure 5 b). Position
tracking of O atoms during annealing ( Figure 5c) showed
that ∼20% of O atoms diﬀused into the Ge sublayer for the
GeOx/Ge case (red squares), but only ∼10% for (Al2O3/
GeOx)/Ge(blue circles). While the GeO x/Ge interface is
known to be thermodynamically unstable,45 as also observed
in our simulation, the incorporation of Al atoms into GeOx
signiﬁcantly suppresses oxygen out-diﬀusion. The thermody-

namic origin of this stabilization eﬀect is attributed to an Al−O
bond much stronger compared to that of Ge−O (see Ellingham
diagram analysis in theSupporting Information). The driving
force for O-diﬀusion is hampered by the presence of Al−O
bonds and therefore O remains better con ﬁned. Similar
stabilization eﬀects have also been observed by incorporating
other metal elements or nitrogen into GeOx.46
Three major consequences of Al2O3 ALD on GeOx/Ge can
be derived from the ReaxFF simulations. First, a pronounced
TMA adsorption is expected along with a conformal growth
mode. Second, an (Al2O3/GeOx) intermixing layer is formed,
and only Al−O and Ge−O bonds are present at the interface.
Third, the intermixing layer suppresses oxygen diﬀusion into
Ge. All three contribute to a reduction of trap state density at
the dielectric/Ge interface.
In situ SE monitoring experiments were performed to
validate the ReaxFF predictions of Al2O3 ALD on GeOx/Ge. A
nominally 5 Å-thick GeOx overlayer was formed prior to ALD
deposition by exposing the hydrogenated Ge surface to a
remote oxygen plasma.39 The ALD nucleation behavior (Figure
6a) is also nonlinear but with distinctively diﬀerent character-
istics of TMA adsorption and GPC compared to those of Ge:H
surfaces. The nucleation can be categorized into four regions
(Figure 6b). During the ﬁrst ALD cycle (region I), TMA
adsorption is pronounced at ∼45% higher than the baseline;
this is attributed to the high density of TMA chemisorption
sites on GeOx, as predicted in ReaxFF simulations. The high
conformity growth mode revealed by the simulation was also
veriﬁed using postdeposition AFM measurements (see
Supporting Information). The resultant GPC/TMA-adsorption
ratio is signi ﬁcantly higher than the baseline ( Figure 6c),
indicating that H 2O is not the only oxidizing agent. This
signature is in agreement with the ReaxFF predicted self-
cleaning eﬀect where TMA is directly oxidized by GeOx in the
absence of H2O.
In the followingﬁve cycles (region II inFigure 6b), the TMA
adsorption level is moderate and relatively constant (∼60% of
the baseline), but the GPC is close to zero, resulting in a large
deviation of the GPC/TMA-adsorption ratio from the baseline
(Figure 6c). Even with a sizable TMA adsorption, a small Al2O3
overlayer is formed due to intermixing, whereby the Al atoms
penetrate into GeOx, densifying the oxide, as predicted by
ReaxFF. In region III, TMA adsorption level and growth rate
gradually approach the baseline; the self-cleaning and
intermixing eﬀects are still present but to a smaller degree.
After ALD cycle n = 9 in region IV, all parameters remain
relatively constant with values similar to the baseline. At this
point, the Al2O3 overlayer coalesces, and the conventional ALD
Al2O3 process becomes the dominant reaction mechanism.
Ex situ high resolution XPS measurements were performed
to determine the chemical bonding state of Ge after Al2O3 ALD
on GeOx/Ge surfaces (Figure 7). Three samples with diﬀerent
starting surfaces were evaluated: Ge:H, GeOx(3 Å)/Ge, and
GeOx(5 Å)/Ge. An Al2O3 cap layer of∼1 nm was deposited to
ensure a coalescedﬁlm and avoid Ge valence state changes by
air exposure during sample transfer to the XPS system; this
thickness also allowed suﬃcient signal from the GeO x/Ge
interface. The Ge:H sample is a control sample that shows a
minimal amount of GeOx, with +3 and +4 oxidation states
absent and only a small signal from +1 and +2 states. The lower
oxidation states can be ascribed to the transition region of a
suboxide layer separating the Ge bulk from the Al2O3
overlayer.37 For the GeO x/Ge samples, peak intensities of
lower Ge oxidation states are similar to those measured from
the Ge:H sample and also attributed to the suboxide transition
layer. Higher oxidation states (+3 and +4) that were expected
to occur for GeOx/Ge47 are barely above the detection limit for
GeOx (3 Å)/Ge and give rise to only weak signals for the GeOx
(5 Å)/Ge sample. This experimentally con ﬁrms the self-
cleaning eﬀect where oxygen is scavenged from GeOx.40,48
Properties of the (Al2O3/GeOx)/Ge(100) Interface. The
electrical properties of (Al2O3/GeOx)/Ge(100) interfaces were
tested by fabricating MOSCap with a device structure shown in
Figure 8a. The starting surface was GeOx(5 Å)/p-Ge(100) on
which Al2O3 was deposited by ALD forn cycles, followed by 24
Å of HfO2 to limit the gate leakage current (JG) and enable
impedance measurements. A 60 nm-thick Ni gate contact was
used. More details on the fabrication process are given in the
Supporting Information. Four MOSCap devices were evaluated
using n = 0, 4, 9, and 15 cycles of Al2O3 ALD, corresponding to
the following four nucleation stages on GeOx/Ge surface: (1)
no Al 2O3, (2) partially intermixed Al 2O3/GeOx, (3) fully
intermixed Al 2O3/GeOx capped with a coalesced Al 2O3
overlayer, and (4) overgrowing Al2O3 after coalescence.Figures

8b and c exemplarily show results forC−V and JG−V curves for
the n = 9 device.
The MOSCap device performances were evaluated by the
following electrical parameters: capacitance density at accumu-
lation (Cmax), C−V hysteresis (ΔVFB), JG at 1 V overdrive, and
Dit at valence band top (Ev) (seeFigures 8d−g). Trends in the
electrical characteristics correlate well with the four-stage
nucleation scenario of Al2O3 ALD on GeOx/Ge. Cmax directly
reﬂects the capacitance density of the gate oxide and is
determined asCmax = εox/tox, whereεox and tox are the dielectric
constant and thickness of the gate oxide layer, respectively.
Instead ofn = 0 (no Al2O3), Cmax is the highest in then =9
device. An insuﬃcient Al2O3 ALD (n = 0 and 4) will result in a
direct contact between the subsequently deposited HfO2 and
the unstable GeOx/Ge interface, which has been reported to
form volatile GeO di ﬀusing into HfO2 and to oxidize Ge
sublayers via a two-step reaction mechanism.46 The additional
GeOx formed increases the overalltox and lowers the eﬀective
εox of the gate oxide due to a lower εox of GeOx (∼4.5)
compared to those of Al2O3 (∼9) and HfO2 (∼18), leading to
Cmax reduction. Forn = 9 cycles, intermixing of (Al2O3/GeOx)
is maximized, and the Al2O3 overlayer is coalesced, preventing a
direct contact between GeO x/Ge and HfO 2. Due to the
intermixing, Al2O3 ALD results in a smalltox increase, and the
resultant densiﬁcation of the dielectric slightly increases the
eﬀective εox;49 both factors contribute to a higherCmax for n =9
compared to those of n = 0 and 4. An overgrowth of Al2O3
ALD (n = 15) only causes additional Al2O3 thickness to the
overall tox, which leads to a decreasedCmax compared to that of
n =9 .
The systematic changes in other parameters are in agreement
with the trends inCmax.I nFigure 8e, the high leakage current in
n = 0 and 4 samples can be attributed to the conductive defects
formed by GeO diﬀusion into HfO2. This diﬀusion also creates
slow trap states and causes largeC−V hysteresis,28 as shown in
Figure 8f. With the dielectric/Ge interface stabilized with
suﬃcient Al2O3 (n = 9), overgrowing Al2O3 (n = 15) does not
further reduce the hysteresis but lowers the leakage current due
to an increased thickness of the gate oxide. The absence of any
Al2O3 results in a high interface trap density (Figure 8g) due to
the formation of Ge dangling 50 and Hf−Ge bonds.37 The
device performances bene ﬁt from the self-cleaning and
intermixing eﬀect as well as the formation of a coalesced
Al2O3 cap to avoid direct physical contact between GeOx and
HfO2.
■ CONCLUSIONS
A strategy to rationalize how surface chemistry a ﬀects the
nucleation kinetics in an ALD process was demonstrated by
combining ReaxFF simulations with in situ spectroscopic
ellipsometry of ALD Al2O3 (TMA + H2O) on hydrogenated
and oxidized Ge surfaces. The nucleation characteristics
predicted by simulations were in excellent agreement with
experiments. While the Al2O3 ALD on hydrogenated Ge
surface showed an island growth mode resulting in defective
dielectric/semiconductor interface, a TMA self-cleaning eﬀect
of GeOx was observed during the Al2O3 ALD on GeOx/Ge.
Tandem simulations and experiments revealed that the self-
cleaning eﬀect was accompanied by the formation of an
(Al2O3/GeOx) intermixing layer which was found thermody-
namically stable on Ge by limiting the O diﬀusion from the
GeOx to Ge sublayer. The impact of surface chemistries on the
nucleation behavior was correlated with the electrical character-
istics of the dielectric/semiconductor interface. Optimum
electrical performance of high gate oxide capacitance density,
low gate leakage, smallC−V hysteresis, and low interface trap
density was found for the sample with an intermixed layer and a
completely coalesced Al2O3 overlayer, thus clarifying the origin
of the high quality Al2O3/GeOx/Ge interface and the intimate
connection to the nucleation kinetics and surface reactions at
play. This work clariﬁes the atomic scale mechanism of Al2O3
ALD nucleation on chemically dissimilar Ge surfaces and more
generally demonstrates the potential of a combined simulation
and experimental approach to quantify the ALD processes at a
molecular level duringﬁlm nucleation, which can be expanded
to other precursor and surface chemistries as well.
