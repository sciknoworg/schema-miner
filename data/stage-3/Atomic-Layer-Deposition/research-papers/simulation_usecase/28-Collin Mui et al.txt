We have used density functional theory to investigate the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of hafnium oxide
(HfO 2 ) thin films using metal alkoxides as both metal and oxygen precursors. In particular, we have predicted
chemical mechanisms for the ALD of HfO 2 using tetraethoxyl hafnium [Hf(OEt) 4 ] and water. We find that
the ALD half-reactions involve the formation of stable adsorbed complexes and precursor-mediated ligand-
exchange mechanisms. When Hf(OEt)4 is used as the metal precursor and water is used as the oxygen source,
both the metal and oxygen ligand-exchange reactions are unactivated with respect to the reactants. However,
the reactions have moderate barriers relative to the adsorbed complexes, and the removal of the ethanol
byproducts requires substantial desorption energies. However, when HfCl4 is used as the metal precursor and
Hf(OEt) 4 is used as the oxygen source, both the metal and oxygen half-reactions possess high activation
barriers ( 30 -40 kcal/mol). Our results imply that although Hf(OEt) 4 may be a suitable metal precursor it
has relatively slow kinetics when used as an ALD oxygen source. We have also investigated several alternative
reaction pathways that may affect the overall growth rate, including incomplete elimination surface reactions
and nongrowth ligand exchange reactions. Finally, we discuss the self-limiting nature of the half-reactions
and chemical strategies for adjusting the reactivity of alkoxide ALD precursors.
Introduction
Moore’s law, which states that the number of electronic
devices in integrated circuits increases exponentially over time,
has driven the microelectronics industry for the past several
decades. However, continued scaling of semiconductor devices
requires the integration of novel fabrication processes and new
materials into future semiconductor technology. For example,
as the thickness of the SiO2 gate dielectric in silicon -metal
oxide -semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) devices
approaches atomic dimensions, the tunneling current through
the gate dielectric increases exponentially, and serious perfor-
mance and reliability issues arise. Hence, there is an urgent need
for an alternative higher-permittivity gate dielectric to replace
SiO2 . In addition, the deposition process must result in uniform
and conformal thin films of the high-  dielectric material with
atomic-level control over large areas.
Although many materials have been proposed to replace SiO 2
in MOSFET devices, oxides of zirconium and hafnium, which
possess good dielectric properties, are currently the leading
candidates for future generation semiconductor devices.1 -6 The
deposition of zirconium oxide and hafnium oxide ultrathin films
can be achieved by a process called atomic-layer deposition
(ALD), which is a vapor deposition process based on sequential
self-terminating surface reactions.7,8 Because the precursors are
introduced into the reactor separately, ALD does not involve
gas-phase reactions, ideally meaning that it is a completely
surface-reaction-limited process. Not only can ALD be used
for a variety of different materials, but it is also capable of
depositing highly conformal and uniform thin films with atomic-
level thickness control. Thus, ALD is particularly suitable for
the deposition of high- ZrO 2 and HfO 2 gate dielectrics for
future MOSFET devices.
ALD of ZrO 2 and HfO 2 is commonly performed using the
respective metal chloride and water as precursors. 5,6,9 -12 How-
ever, the metal chloride -water ALD process suffers from
several disadvantages, such as chlorine contamination and slow
growth rates due to submonolayer growth per cycle. As a result,
high deposition temperatures are required to minimize Cl
contamination. Unfortunately, for ALD of ZrO2 and HfO 2 , the
film quality degrades at high temperatures. To deposit very pure
and uniform thin films at lower temperatures by ALD efficiently,
alternative precursors that are reactive on the growing film
surface but thermally stable in the liquid phase are preferred.
Organometallic compounds, such as metal amides and metal
alkoxides, have been proposed as ALD precursors for ZrO2 and
HfO 2 , and high-quality thin films have been obtained at
temperatures as low as 150 ° C. 3,4,13 -17
Metal alkoxides possess many desirable advantages as ALD
precursors compared to metal chlorides. First, the high reactivity
of metal alkoxides may result in lower deposition temperatures.
Also, the use of metal alkoxides in ZrO2 and HfO 2 ALD
eliminates the possibility of chlorine contamination in the thin
film, which is detrimental to device reliability. Moreover,
because metal alkoxides contain both metal and oxygen, not
only can they be used as both metal and oxygen precursors,
but it is also possible to use them to deposit mixed metal thin
films by ALD.3,15 Finally, the chemical properties of metal

alkoxide precursors can be changed using principles of organic
and organometallic chemistry. For example, because tert -butyl
groups donate electrons more readily than methyl groups as a
result of inductive effects, the reactivities of tetra-tert -butoxyl
hafnium and tetramethoxyl hafnium are expected to be influ-
enced by the ligands.
In this paper, we present a DFT study of the surface reactions
of a proposed HfO 2 ALD mechanism using hafnium alkoxides
as precursors. On the basis of our previous work, we expect
the chemisty of ZrO2 deposition to be similar to that of HfO 2
deposition; 5,6 therefore, we focus on the surface reactions of
tetraethoxyl hafnium [Hf(OEt) 4 ] during ALD of HfO 2 .I n
particular, we have determined atomistic mechanisms of two
chemical systems for HfO2 ALD involving Hf(OEt) 4 . First, we
have calculated the surface reactions of HfO 2 ALD with
Hf(OEt) 4 as the metal precursor and water as the oxygen source.
Second, we have investigated ALD of HfO 2 with HfCl 4 as the
metal precursor and Hf(OEt) 4 as the oxygen source. We focus
on the chemical mechanisms of the ALD ligand-exchange half-
reactions and alternative pathways for competing reactions.
Although there is currently no experimental data for HfO2 ALD
using Hf(OEt) 4 , our calculations on this relatively simple model
system explain the surface chemistry and reactivity trends of
HfO2 ALD using alkoxide precursors. In particular, we expect
more complicated alkoxide precursors to behave similarly to
Hf(OEt)4 , and we will discuss precursor design using principles
of organic chemistry to adjust the reactivity of the metallorganic
precursor.
Computational Details
Our approach involves the application of quantum chemistry
to the calculation of energies and other properties of reacting
chemical systems from first principles. In particular, density
functional theory (DFT) employing the B3LYP hybrid functional
was used to determine the energies of the reactants, products,
intermediates, and transition states of the surface reactions
possibly involved in HfO2 ALD. 18 To model the active surface
sites on the HfO 2 surface during ALD, we employed a cluster
approximation. Specifically, the Hf(OH) 3 -OH, Hf(OH) 3 -OEt,
and Hf(OH) 3 -Cl clusters were used to model the hydroxyl,
ethoxyl, and chloride sites, respectively, on the as-grown HfO 2
thin-film surface (Figure 1). It has been shown that ALD surface
reactions on ZrO2 and HfO 2 are localized in nature. 5,6 However,
the reaction energies are affected by the surrounding material
if the precursor interacts directly with neighboring surface atoms,
such as when the precursor adsorbs to two reactive sites or when
the ligand bonds to neighboring surface atoms. In the cases that
we have investigated, the additional interactions shift the PES
by an amount equal to the energy of the additional interaction
but generally do not affect the energetics of the elementary
steps. 19 In this paper, we have not included reactions involving
multiple surface ligands.
The electronic structure was expanded using atomic basis
functions. Energy minima and transition states on the potential
energy surface (PES) for the reactions are obtained by perform-
ing unconstrained geometry optimization calculations. In the
geometry optimization calculations, Hf atoms are described by
the LANL2DZ effective core potential (ECP) basis set,20 -22
whereas the 6-31G(d) basis set 23 -27 is used to describe nonmetal
atoms such as C, Cl, H, and O. To improve the accuracy of the
calculated reaction energies, we performed single-point energy
calculations on the optimized structures with an enhanced mixed
basis set scheme in which Hf and nonmetal atoms are described
by the LANL2DZ and 6-31++G(d,p) basis sets, respectively.
We have also performed full geometry optimizations with the
enhanced mixed basis set for the reaction between water and
the ethoxyl surface group and find that the relative energies
from single-point calculations are accurate to within 1.2 kcal/
mol compared to those calculated using full geometry optimiza-
tions. All energy minima and transition states are verified by
frequency calculations to have zero and one imaginary fre-
quency, respectively. The energies reported are zero-point
corrected. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian
98 program.28
Results
Tetraethoxyl Hafnium as a Metal Precursor. The ligand-
exchange half-reactions of HfO 2 ALD using Hf(OEt) 4 and water
as precursors involve ethanol (EtOH) elimination. In the metal-
ligand exchange reaction, Hf(OEt)4 reacts with a surface
hydroxyl group [Hf -OH*] to form a new Hf -O bond on the
surface and three surface ethoxyl groups [Hf -O -Hf(OEt) 3 *]
(reaction 1). We have calculated three pathways for the metal-
ligand exchange reaction. Ethanol (EtOH) is eliminated in the
hydrogen-transfer and ethyl group-transfer pathways (reaction
1a), whereas theâ-hydride-elimination pathway results in
ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) and water (H 2 O) as byproducts (reaction 1b).
The oxygen-ligand exchange reaction (reaction 2) involves
the reaction of water with a surface ethoxyl group produced by
the metal-ligand exchange reaction. Although the oxygen-ligand
exchange reaction also results in ethanol elimination, it does
not lead to the formation of new Hf-O bonds. Instead, the
reaction converts the surface ethoxyl groups to surface hydroxyl
groups to prepare the surface for the subsequent metal half-
reaction. This reaction is isodesmic (the reaction conserves the
number of each type of bond) and should thus be approximately
thermoneutral.
Metal-Ligand Exchange Half-Reactions. We have calculated
several pathways that may occur during the Hf(OEt) 4 metal-
ligand exchange cycle. Optimized structures of the hydrogen-
transfer pathway and the ethyl-transfer pathway (reaction 1a)
are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The calculated
energies of the products, transition states, and intermediates at
different temperatures are shown in Table 1 for both pathways.

The hydrogen-transfer pathway begins with the adsorption of
Hf(OEt) 4 onto the surface hydroxyl group to form a four-
membered-ring complex in which each Hf atom of the complex
is 5-fold coordinated [Ads-Hf -OH -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. We find that
the adsorbed Hf(OEt) 4 surface complex is very stable because
it involves the formation of two dative bonds. The binding
energy of the adsorbed complex is-27.2 kcal/mol with respect
to the energy of the reactants. The hydroxyl group in the
complex then transfers its hydrogen atom to one of the ethoxyl
ligands of Ads-Hf -OH -Hf(OEt) 4 through a hydrogen-transfer
transition state [TS1 -Hf -OH -EtOH] to form a bound ethanol
molecule. We find that the transition state is located at 15.5
kcal/mol with respect to the adsorbed complex. The hydrogen-
transfer process results in an ethanol molecule bound to a four-
membered-ring intermediate through a dative bond [Int-Hf -
OEt -EtOH], which has an overall energy of -15.3 kcal/mol
with respect to the reactants. The bound ethanol molecule then
desorbs directly from the four-membered-ring intermediate
without a transition state, and the resulting four-membered-ring
intermediate is located 16.3 kcal/mol above the bound ethanol
state [Hf-Ring -OEt]. Finally, the four-membered-ring inter-
mediate undergoes a ring-opening transition state [TS -Hf -
Ring -OEt], which is located 16.0 kcal/mol above the four-
membered-ring intermediate, to form the ethoxyl-terminated
surface [Hf-O -Hf(OEt) 3 *]. The hydrogen-transfer pathway for
the metal-ligand exchange cycle of HfO 2 ALD is 5.6 kcal/mol
exothermic relative to the gas-phase Hf(OEt) 4 and surface
hydroxyl group reactants.
In addition to the hydrogen-transfer pathway, we have
calculated two additional reaction pathways, namely, ethyl group
transfer andâ-hydride elimination, for the reaction of Hf(OEt) 4
with a surface hydroxyl group. Optimized structures for the ethyl
group-transfer pathway (reaction 1a) are shown in Figure 3.
Similar to the hydrogen-transfer pathway, the ethyl group-
transfer pathway involves the formation of a dative-bonded
complex upon the adsorption of Hf(OEt)4 onto a surface
hydroxyl group [Ads -Hf -OH -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. Next, the pathway
proceeds through an ethyl group-transfer transition state [TS2 -
Hf -OH -EtOH] and an ethanol-bound four-membered-ring
intermediate [Int -Hf -OEt -EtOH]. Following ethanol desorp-
tion, the resulting four-membered-ring intermediate [Hf -Ring -
OEt] is transformed to the ethoxyl-terminated surface [Hf -O -
Hf(OEt) 3 *] through a ring-opening transition state [TS -Hf -
Ring -OEt]. The rate-limiting step of the ethyl group-transfer
pathway is the ethyl group-transfer step, which involves an
overall activation barrier of 60.8 kcal/mol relative to the
adsorbed complex at 0 K. The products, which include EtOH
and Hf-O -Hf(OEt) 3 *, are located at -5.6 kcal/mol with
respect to the reactants (Table 1).
Optimized structures of the â-hydride-elimination pathway
(reaction 1b) are shown in Figure 4. The pathway proceeds via

an adsorbed surface complex [Ads -Hf -OH -Hf(OEt) 4 ], a
â-hydride-elimination transition state [TS3 -Hf -OH -C 2 H 4 -
H 2 O], a water-bound intermediate [Int -Hf -OEt -H 2 O], a four-
membered-ring intermediate [Hf -Ring -OEt], and a ring-
opening transition state [TS -Hf -Ring -OEt] to form the
ethoxyl-terminated surface [Hf -O -Hf(OEt) 3 *]. The rate-limit-
ing step of the â-hydride-elimination pathway is the elimination
of a â hydrogen from the ethoxyl group of the adsorbed complex
to form water bound to the four-membered-ring intermediate.
The overall activation barrier of the â-hydride-elimination
pathway is calculated to be 44.5 kcal/mol with respect to the
reactants, and the products of the reaction, which consist of
C2 H 4 ,H 2 O, and Hf -O -Hf(OEt) 3 *, are located 4.9 kcal/mol
above the energy of the reactants (Table 1).
Our calculations show that the hydrogen-transfer pathway is
kinetically the most favorable for the conversion of surface

hydroxyl termination on the HfO 2 surface to an ethoxyl-
terminated surface. In particular, the rate-limiting step of the
hydrogen-transfer pathway is ethanol desorption, and the
activation barrier for the elementary process is 16.3 kcal/mol.
Although the same adsorbed complex [Ads-Hf -OH -Hf -
(OEt) 4 ] is involved in the three pathways, the activation barriers
for the ethyl group-transfer and the â-hydride-elimination
elementary steps are 60.8 and 44.5 kcal/mol, respectively. In
addition, theâ-hydride-elimination pathway is thermodynami-
cally unfavorable. Therefore, the ethyl group-transfer and the
â-hydride-elimination pathways are not likely to compete with
the hydrogen-transfer mechanism of the metal-ligand exchange
cycle of HfO2 ALD using Hf(OEt) 4 as the metal precursor.
A major difference between the ethyl group-transfer and the
â-hydride-elimination pathways is that whereas the ethyl group-
transfer pathway involves ethanol as the only gas phase
byproduct theâ-hydride-elimination pathway results in two gas-
phase products, ethylene and water. Therefore, for the â-hydride-
elimination pathway, the free energy of the products has a larger
entropic contribution from the two gas-phase products at high
temperature. As a result, the reaction free energy of the
â-hydride-elimination pathway decreases more quickly than the
reaction free energy of the ethyl group-transfer pathway as the
temperature is raised, leading to the intersecting Gibbs free
energy curves seen in Figure 4.
Oxygen-Ligand Exchange Half-Reaction. The reaction path-
way for the oxygen-ligand exchange half-reaction (reaction 2),
which involves the reaction of water with surface ethoxyl
groups, is shown in Figure 5. In addition, the energetics for
this half-reaction at different temperatures are summarized in
Table 2. The first step of the oxygen-ligand exchange half-
reaction involves the adsorption of water onto the Hf atom of
the ethoxyl-terminated surface site (Hf-OEt*) to form a dative-
bonded water complex (Ads -Hf -OEt -H 2 O). Our calculations
show that the adsorption energy is 10.6 kcal/mol. A hydrogen
atom then transfers from the adsorbed water complex to the
surface ethoxyl group to form an adsorbed ethanol complex via
a transition state (TS-Hf -OEt -EtOH) located at 10.8 kcal/
mol with respect to the adsorbed complex. The energy of the
dative-bonded ethanol complex is-9.3 kcal/mol with respect
to the reactants (Int -Hf -OH -EtOH). Finally, ethanol desorbs
to complete the conversion of the surface ethoxyl group to a
surface hydroxyl group (Hf-OH*). The overall reaction is
endothermic by 2.5 kcal/mol. These results show that the
activation barrier of the oxygen-ligand exchange reaction is
lower than that of the metal-ligand exchange reaction.
Tetraethoxyl Hafnium as an Oxygen Precursor. Tetra-
ethoxyl hafnium can also be used as the oxygen precursor for
ALD of HfO2 . In particular, we have investigated surface
reactions that are likely involved in ALD of HfO 2 with HfCl 4
as the metal precursor and Hf(OEt) 4 as the oxygen precursor.
The metal half-reaction involves the surface reaction of HfCl 4
with surface ethoxyl sites, which results in the formation of a
chlorine-terminated surface (reaction 3). We have studied two

different reaction pathways for the reaction of HfCl 4 on the
ethoxyl surface site, namely, the ethyl group transfer (reaction
3a) and theâ-hydride elimination (reaction 3b).
The reaction of Hf(OEt) 4 with surface chloride groups
constitutes the oxygen half-reaction, which leads to the restora-
tion of the surface ethoxyl termination layer and the elimination
of gas-phase products (reaction 4). Similar to the metal-ligand
exchange reaction, the ethyl group-transfer (reaction 4a) and
the â-hydride-elimination (reaction 4a) pathways are investi-
gated.
Metal Half-Reaction. The metal half-reaction involves the
reaction of HfCl 4 with the ethoxyl surface site. We have
calculated two pathways for the reaction, with their energies
summarized in Table 3. The ethyl group-transfer pathway
(reaction 3a) involves an initial adsorption of HfCl4 onto the
ethoxyl surface site to form a dative-bonded complex with an
adsorption energy of 20.9 kcal/mol (Ads-Hf -OEt -HfCl 4 ). The
complex then undergoes ethyl group transfer via a transition
state (TS1-Hf -Cl -EtCl) to form the chlorine-terminated
surface site (Hf -O -HfCl 3 *) via elimination of ethyl chloride.
We find that the activation barrier for this ethyl group-transfer
process is 21.4 kcal/mol with respect to the reactants and 42.3
kcal/mol relative to the adsorbed complex. The products are
located at-13.4 kcal/mol with respect to the reactants. Although
the overall reaction is thermodynamically favorable, the calcu-
lated activation barrier for the ethyl group-transfer pathway of
the metal half-reaction is relatively high.
The â-hydride-elimination pathway (reaction 3b) begins with
the adsorption of HfCl 4 to form an adsorbed complex dative

bonded to the surface ethoxyl group (Ads -Hf -OEt -HfCl 4 ).
This pathway then proceeds via a â-hydride-elimination transi-
tion state (TS2 -Hf -OEt -C 2 H 4 -HCl) to form a weakly bound
hydrogen chloride complex (Int -Hf -Cl -HCl), releasing an
ethylene molecule to the gas phase. Finally, HCl desorbs to form
the ethoxyl-terminated surface site (Hf-O -HfCl 3 *). The â-hy-
dride-elimination transition state is located at 15.6 kcal/mol with
respect to the reactants and 36.5 kcal/mol above the adsorbed
state. The final products are 2.3 kcal/mol less stable than the
reactants at 0 K (Table 3).
Oxygen Half-Reaction. The oxygen half-reaction for ALD
of HfO 2 with HfCl 4 and Hf(OEt) 4 as precursors involves the
reaction of Hf(OEt) 4 on a chlorine-terminated surface site (Hf -
Cl*). Similar to the metal half-reaction, we find two reaction
pathways for the oxygen half-reaction with the calculated
energies summarized in Table 4. The reaction path for the ethyl
group-transfer pathway involves an initial adsorption of Hf-
(OEt)4 onto the chloride surface site to form a dative-bonded
complex [Ads -Hf -Cl -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. The complex then reacts to
form the final ethoxyl-terminated surface site [Hf -O -Hf -
(OEt) 3 *] via an ethyl group transition state [TS1 -Hf -OEt -
EtCl]. The adsorbed complex, transition state, and final products
are located at-17.0, 27.9, and -4.5 kcal/mol with respect to
the reactants, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, the activation
barrier of the reaction is 44.9 kcal/mol with respect to the
adsorbed complex. We find that the mechanisms for the ethyl
group-transfer pathways of the metal and oxygen half-reactions
are similar; both involve an initial adsorption and ethyl group
transfer to form the products in a single step.
The â-hydride-elimination mechanism for the oxygen half-
reaction involves the adsorption of Hf(OEt) 4 onto the chlorine-
terminated surface site to form a dative-bonded complex [Ads -
Hf -Cl -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. The complex then undergoes â-hydride
elimination [TS2 -Hf -Cl -C 2 H 4 -HCl] to form an HCl mol-
ecule bound to the ethoxyl-terminated surface site [Int -Hf -
OEt -HCl]. Finally, the desorption of HCl occurs to regenerate
the ethoxyl-terminated surface site [Hf -O -Hf(OEt) 3 *] for the
next metal half-reaction. We find that the adsorbed complex,
â-hydride transition state, bound HCl, and final products have
energies of -17.0, 19.8, 7.5, and 11.3 kcal/mol relative to the
reactants, respectively (Table 4). Thus, the activation barrier of
the oxygen half-reaction is 36.8 kcal/mol with respect to the
adsorbed complex.
When the energies of the ethyl group-transfer and the
â-hydride-elimination pathways for both the metal and oxygen
half-reactions are compared, the calculations show that whereas
the ethyl group-transfer pathway involves a higher activation
barrier the products are thermodynamically more stable at 0 K.
However, the reaction free energy for the ethyl group-transfer
pathway increases as the temperature is increased. On the other
hand, theâ-hydride-elimination pathway results in two gas-
phase products, and the reaction free energy decreases when
the temperature is increased because entropic driving forces
dominate at high temperatures. In particular, the products of
theâ-hydride-elimination pathway have lower free energy than
those of the ethyl group-transfer pathway at 750 K.
Incomplete Elimination Surface Reactions. Tetraethoxyl
Hafnium as a Metal Precursor. Competing reactions may lead
to the incomplete removal of surface termination groups or
submonolayer growth; therefore, we have investigated the
possibility of alternative reactions that may compete kinetically
with the ligand-exchange half-reactions described above. In
particular, we have studied two reaction pathways leading to
the incomplete elimination of surface ethoxyl terminating groups
during ALD of HfO2 with Hf(OEt) 4 as the metal precursor.
Figure 6 shows the ethyl group-transfer pathway for a
competing reaction to the metal half-reaction of HfO 2 ALD with
Hf(OEt) 4 as the metal precursor. Temperature-dependent ener-
getics for the incomplete-elimination pathway are summarized
in Table 5. The pathway involves an initial adsorption of Hf -
(OEt) 4 onto a hydroxyl surface site [Ads -Hf -OH -Hf(OEt) 4 ],
followed by an ethyl group-transfer transition state [TS1 -Hf -
OH -EtOEt] to form a four-membered-ring intermediate with
a bound diethyl ether molecule [Int -Hf -OEt -OH -EtOEt].
Then, diethyl ether desorption occurs, and a four-membered-
ring intermediate is formed [Hf-Ring -OEt -OH]. Finally, the
four-membered-ring intermediate undergoes ring opening [TS -
Hf -Ring -OEt -OH] to form an ethoxyl-hydroxyl termination
layer [Hf -OH -(OEt) 2 *]. Whereas the metal half-reaction
between Hf(OEt) 4 and the hydroxyl surface site (Figure 3)
results in the formation of three ethoxyl groups, the alternative
reaction pathway in Figure 6 results in two ethoxyl groups and
one residual hydroxyl group on the surface Hf. Therefore,
although this alternative surface-reaction pathway leads to HfO2
deposition, it results in the incomplete elimination of surface
hydroxyl groups; therefore, the reaction is not self-limiting.
However, the activation barrier of this incomplete-elimination
surface reaction is 31.5 kcal/mol relative to the entrance channel
and 58.7 kcal/mol relative to the adsorbed complex (Table 5)
and is therefore not expected to compete with the hydrogen-

activation barrier of 16.3 kcal/mol. (Figure 2).
Figure 7 shows another reaction pathway that leads to the
incomplete elimination of surface ethoxyl groups of the metal
half-reaction of HfO2 ALD with Hf(OEt) 4 as the metal precursor.
The species of the incomplete-elimination surface reaction
pathway are the initial adsorbed complex [Ads-Hf-OH -Hf -

be 15.6 kcal/mol relative to the reactants and 42.8 kcal/mol
relative to the adsorbed complex (Table 5), which is significantly
higher than the hydrogen-transfer barrier of the metal half-
reaction. Therefore, we do not expect incomplete elimination
via either ethyl group transfer orâ-hydride elimination to
compete with the hydrogen-transfer pathway of the metal half-
reaction for HfO2 ALD. In other words, the incomplete

elimination of surface hydroxyl groups is not likely to occur
during HfO 2 ALD via these two pathways when Hf(OEt) 4 is
used as the metal precursor.
Tetraethoxyl Hafnium as an Oxygen Precursor. When
Hf(OEt) 4 is used as the oxygen precursor, we find two
incomplete-elimination reaction pathways that may compete
kinetically with the oxygen half-reaction. Free energies at several
temperatures for the incomplete-elimination reactions are sum-
marized in Table 6. The ethyl group-transfer reaction proceeds
by the adsorption of Hf(OEt)4 onto the chlorine-terminated
surface site [Ads -Hf -Cl -Hf(OEt) 4 ], followed by ethyl group
transfer [TS1 -Hf -Cl -EtOEt] to form a bound diethyl ether
[Int -Hf -OEt -Cl -EtOEt]. Finally, diethyl ether desorbs from
the complex to form a Hf surface site terminated with two
ethoxyl ligands and one chlorine atom [Hf -Cl -(OEt) 2 ]. The
ethyl group-transfer pathway for incomplete elimination has an
activation barrier of 47.6 kcal/mol with respect to the adsorbed
complex, and the overall reaction is exothermic by 8.8 kcal/
mol (Table 6).
An alternative reaction pathway for the incomplete elimina-
tion of surface chlorines involves the â-hydride elimination of
an ethoxyl group. Similar to the ethyl group-transfer pathway,
theâ-hydride-elimination pathway proceeds by an initial
adsorption of Hf(OEt) 4 onto the chlorine-terminated surface site
[Ads -Hf -Cl -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. Then, â-hydride elimination [TS2 -
Hf -Cl -C 2 H 4 -EtOH] results in the removal of ethylene and
the formation of a bound ethanol species [Int -Hf -OEt -EtOH].
Finally, ethanol desorbs from the complex to form a Hf surface

site terminated with two ethoxyl groups and one chlorine atom
[Hf -Cl -(OEt) 2 ]. This â-hydride-elimination pathway for in-
complete elimination has an activation barrier of 31.3 kcal/mol
and an enthalpy change of 6.0 kcal/mol at 0 K (Table 6).
When the energetics of incomplete elimination and the oxygen
half-reaction of HfO 2 ALD with Hf(OEt) 4 as the oxygen source
are compared, our calculations show that incomplete elimination
throughâ-hydride elimination is likely to compete kinetically
with the oxygen half-reaction. This is because incomplete
elimination throughâ-hydride elimination involves an activation
barrier of 31.3 kcal/mol (Table 6), which is lower than the
activation barriers of either the ethyl group-transfer pathway
(44.9 kcal/mol) or theâ-hydride-elimination pathway (36.8 kcal/
mol) of the oxygen half-reaction (Table 4). Furthermore, the
incomplete-elimination reaction results in a residual chlorine
atom on the surface. Consequently, chlorine incorporation into
the HfO2 film is facilitated by the incomplete-elimination
pathway, and because this reaction competes kinetically with
the ligand-exchange half-reactions, it is a likely mechanism for
Cl contamination of ALD-grown HfO2 using HfCl 4 as the metal
source and Hf(OEt) 4 as the oxygen source.
Nongrowth Ligand-Exchange Reactions. Although incom-
plete-elimination reactions result in residual surface termination
groups, they deposit a metal atom as do the ligand-exchange
half-reactions. However, nongrowth ligand-exchange reactions
do not result in material deposition and therefore may affect
the overall ALD growth rate. Figure 8 shows a nongrowth
ligand-exchange reaction between Hf(OEt) 4 and a surface
hydroxyl group, the energies of which are summarized in Table
7. The nongrowth ligand-exchange reaction involves the adsorp-
tion of Hf(OEt)4 onto the surface hydroxyl group [Hf -OH*]
to form a dative-bonded complex [Ads -Hf -OH -Hf(OEt) 4 ],
followed by the desorption of triethoxylhydroxyl hafnium
[HfOH(OEt)3 ] to form an ethoxyl-terminated surface site [Hf -
OEt*]. In this reaction, the hydroxyl ligand is converted to the
ethoxyl ligand through a ligand-exchange process with gas-phase

Hf(OEt) 4 . This reaction has no transition state, and the products
are located 0.1 kcal/mol above the reactants a t 0 K (Table 7).
Nongrowth ligand-exchange reactions can also compete with
the ALD half-reactions when Hf(OEt) 4 is used as the oxygen
precursor. For example, nongrowth ligand exchange between
HfCl4 and an ethoxyl surface site involves the adsorption of
HfCl 4 onto the ethoxyl surface termination group (Hf -OEt*)
to form an adsorbed complex (Ads -Hf -OEt -HfCl 4 ), followed
by the desorption of gas-phase trichloroethoxyl hafnium (HfCl 3 -
OEt) to form an Hf -Cl* site on the surface. This reaction has
no overall activation barrier a t 0 K and is exothermic by 9.6
kcal/mol a t 0 K (Table 7).
We have also calculated the reaction path for a nongrowth
ligand-exchange reaction between Hf(OEt) 4 and a chlorine-
terminated surface site. Similar to the nongrowth ligand-
exchange reactions described above, the pathway proceeds by
the initial adsorption of Hf(OEt)4 onto the surface, in this case,
the chlorine-terminated surface site [Hf -Cl*], to form a dative-
bonded complex [Ads -Hf -Cl -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. This step is followed
by the desorption of chlorotriethoxyl hafnium [HfCl -(OEt) 3 ],
which results in an ethoxyl ligand on the surface [Hf -OEt*].
The reaction is exothermic by 1.7 kcal/mol and has no transition
state (Table 7).
Unlike incomplete-elimination reactions, which possess rela-
tively high activation barriers, nongrowth exchange reactions
have no transition states, and thus their activation energies
relative to the reactants are equal to their reaction energy.
Therefore, whereas the incomplete-elimination reactions are
unlikely to compete with the ligand-exchange half-reactions for
HfO2 ALD using Hf(OEt) 4 , nongrowth ligand-exchange reac-
tions can compete kinetically with the half-reactions. For
example, when Hf(OEt)4 is used as the oxygen source, the
â-hydride-elimination pathway of the oxygen half-reaction and
incomplete elimination have calculated activation barriers of
36.8 and 31.3 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas nongrowth ligand
exchange between Hf(OEt)4 and Hf -Cl* has an effective
activation barrier of 15.3 kcal/mol. In addition to kinetic
competition, nongrowth ligand-exchange reactions merely in-
volve the exchange of surface termination groups and do not
deposit material. Therefore, they decrease the overall ALD
growth rate to the degree that these pathways are active. This
is especially true when Hf(OEt)4 is used as the oxygen precursor
because the ligand-exchange half-reactions leading to growth
possess relatively high activation barriers.
Self-Terminating Nature of the Half-Reactions. Whereas
nongrowth ligand-exchange reactions decrease the overall
growth rates, the reaction of gas phase precursors with the
surface termination layer beyond the self-terminating limit
increases the overall deposition rate. However, these reactions
are undesirable in ALD because its self-limiting nature and
associated desirable properties are negatively affected. To
investigate the self-limiting nature of HfO2 ALD using Hf(OEt) 4 ,
we have calculated two pathways for the reaction of Hf(OEt) 4
with surface ethoxyl termination groups.
Figure 9 shows the ethyl group-transfer pathway for the
nonself-limiting reaction of Hf(OEt) 4 with a surface ethoxyl
termination group. The energetics of the self-limiting surface
reactions are summarized in Table 8. The reaction proceeds by
an initial Hf(OEt)4 adsorption, which results in the formation
of a dative-bonded adsorbed complex consisting of five ethoxyl
groups [Ads-Hf -OEt -Hf(OEt) 4 ]. The complex then undergoes
an ethyl group-transfer transition state [TS1 -Hf -OEt -EtOEt]
to form a bound diethyl ether intermediate [Int -Hf -OEt -
EtOEt]. Diethyl ether then desorbs to form a second complex
with three ethoxyl groups attached to it [Hf -Ring -OEt]. The
final product of the surface reaction, which is a surface Hf with
three ethoxyl ligands [Hf-O -Hf(OEt) 3 *], is formed via a ring-
opening transition state [TS -Hf -Ring -OEt]. The activation
barrier for this pathway is 60.8 kcal/mol with respect to the
adsorbed complex, and the products are located 7.5 kcal/mol
below the reactants at 0 K (Table 8).
The nonself-limiting â-hydride-elimination pathway for the
reaction of Hf(OEt) 4 with a surface ethoxyl termination group
(Figure 10) proceeds by the initial adsorption of Hf(OEt) 4 onto
the ethoxyl surface site to form an adsorbed complex [Ads -
Hf -OEt -Hf(OEt) 4 ], similar to the ethyl group-transfer reaction.
One of the ethoxyl groups in the complex then undergoes
â-hydride elimination [TS2 -Hf -OEt -C 2 H 4 -EtOH] to elimi-
nate ethylene, which results in an ethanol molecule bound to
the complex [Int-Hf -OEt -EtOH]. Finally, the four-membered
ring complex [Hf -ring -OEt] is transformed into the ethoxyl-
terminated surface product [Hf -O -Hf(OEt) 3 *] via a ring-
opening transition state [TS -Hf -ring -OEt]. The activation
barrier of this surface reaction is 42.3 kcal/mol with respect to
the adsorbed complex, and the products are 7.4 kcal/mol less
stable than the reactants at 0 K (Table 8).
In addition to the nonself-limiting reaction of gas-phase
Hf(OEt) 4 with surface ethoxyl groups, the continuous growth
of HfO 2 can occur through the self-elimination of surface
ethoxyl groups. In particular, Table 9 shows the free energies
for theâ-hydride elimination of an ethoxyl termination group.
Here, the surface ethoxyl group (Hf -OEt*) undergoes â-hydride
elimination (TS -Hf -C 2 H 4 -OH) to eliminate ethylene and form
a surface hydroxyl group (Hf -OH*). Subsequent reaction of
the surface hydroxyl group with gas-phase Hf(OEt) 4 can lead
to multilayer growth. The activation barrier of the self-
elimination process is 62.7 kcal/mol, and the products are 12.9
kcal/mol less stable than the reactants. Because the activation
barrier for this reaction is much higher than those of the ligand-
exchange half-reactions, it is not likely to compete kinetically
with the ALD half-reactions.
Alkoxides can be used as a single source precursor for the
metal -organic chemical deposition (MOCVD) of ZrO 2 and
HfO 2 thin films. 29,30 The difference between MOCVD and ALD
is that whereas ALD surface reactions are self-limiting MOCVD
results in continuous film growth. Therefore, MOCVD surface
reactions are undesirable in an ALD process. Although MOCVD
of HfO2 can occur via either the surface reaction of Hf(OEt) 4
with ethoxyl surface sites or the self-elimination of ethoxyl
groups on the surface, our results show that the surface reaction
of Hf(OEt)4 with ethoxyl groups is kinetically and thermody-
namically more favorable. When Hf(OEt) 4 is used as the metal
precursor, MOCVD surface reactions are not likely to affect
the self-limiting nature of HfO 2 ALD. This is because the
lowest-energy pathway for the metal half-reaction of HfO 2 ALD
is hydrogen transfer, which has an activation barrier of 16.3
kcal/mol with respect to the adsorbed complex, whereas the
â-hydride-elimination pathway that is active in MOCVD for
the reaction between Hf(OEt) 4 and the surface ethoxyl termina-
tion group has an activation barrier of 42.3 kcal/mol. However,
when Hf(OEt)4 is used as the oxygen precursor, the â-hydride-
elimination pathway for the oxygen half-reaction has an
activation barrier of 36.8 kcal/mol relative to the adsorbed state,
which is close to that of the reaction of Hf(OEt)4 with surface
ethoxyl groups. Because a high deposition temperature is
required to overcome the high activation barriers of the half-
reactions for ALD with the alkoxide used as an oxygen source,
15160 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 108, No. 39, 2004 Mui and Musgrave


the rate of MOCVD surface reactions may be substantial at ALD
temperatures, and self-termination ALD may not occur.
ALD Precursor Design. Our results indicate that when
combined with HfCl 4 , Hf(OEt) 4 is not a good oxygen precursor
for HfO 2 ALD because the half-reactions have high activation
barriers. However, because alkoxide precursors are organo-
metallic compounds, it is possible to “tune” the reactivity of
alkoxide precursor using principles of organic chemistry. We
use a simple example to demonstrate the design of alkoxide
precursors.
Here, we consider the self- â-hydride elimination of different
surface alkoxide groups. Elimination reactions are classical
organic reactions, and it is well known that the activation barrier
of elimination decreases with electron-donating substituent
groups. To demonstrate the application of this classic organic
chemistry principle to the molecular engineering of alkoxide
precursors, we have calculated the reaction energies and
activation barriers for theâ-hydride elimination of different
alkoxide ligands. We find that the activation barrier for self-
elimination decreases with methyl substitution in the alkoxide

for the self-elimination of ethoxyl, isopropoxyl, and tert -butoxyl
termination groups are 62.7, 58.6, and 55.2 kcal/mol, respec-
tively (Table 9). Because methyl groups are electron donating,
our results show that modifying the metal precursor ligands to
increase their basicity can be used to adjust the kinetics of the
self-elimination of surface alkoxide groups. In other words, the
surface reaction kinetics can be tuned through precursor ligand
selection using simple organic chemistry principles.
Discussion
Our results predict that when Hf(OEt) 4 is used as a metal
precursor the activation barriers of the half-reactions are
relatively low. In particular, the rate-limiting step of the
hydrogen-transfer pathway of the metal half-reaction has an
activation barrier of 16.3 kcal/mol, and the transition state of
the oxygen half-reaction is located 10.8 kcal/mol above the
adsorbed complex. In addition, alkoxides are organic and do
not contain halogens. Therefore, the use of alkoxides as ALD
precursors eliminates the issue of Cl contamination, which is
detrimental to device performance.
However, when Hf(OEt) 4 is used as an oxygen precursor,
the calculated activation barriers for the half-reactions are
relatively high. Specifically, the activation barriers for the
â-hydride pathway of the metal and oxygen half-reactions are
36.5 and 36.8 kcal/mol, respectively. However, we also find
that incomplete-elimination surface reactions are likely to
compete kinetically with the ALD ligand-exchange half-
reactions, possibly leading to carbon contamination of the film.
In addition, the reaction of gas-phase Hf(OEt)4 with surface
ethoxyl groups can also compete with the oxygen half-reaction,
violating the self-limiting characteristic of ALD. Therefore, our
results suggest that using Hf(OEt)4 as an oxygen source
combined with HfCl 4 as the metal precursor has several
disadvantages.
Most of the calculated reaction pathways involve one or more
adsorbed complexes. Moreover, because of the stability of the
Hf-O dative bond, the adsorbed complexes are often more
stable than the final products of the half-reactions. For example,

Hf(OEt) 4 with surface hydroxyl groups (Figure 2), the initial
adsorbed complex and the ethanol-bound complex are located
at-27.2 kcal/mol (two dative bonds) and -15.3 kcal/mol (one
dative bond), respectively, relative to the reactants, whereas the
overall energy of the reaction is only-5.6 kcal/mol (Table 1).
In the oxygen half-reaction (Figure 5), the initial adsorbed
complex, the ethanol-bound complex, and the final products are
located at-10.6, -9.9, and 2.5 kcal/mol, respectively, relative
to the energy of the reactants (Table 2). This means that both
the metal and oxygen half-reactions are likely to be trapped in
one of the adsorbed states, and the net rate of product formation
is determined by the barriers relative to these intermediates and
is thus slow, even under the nonequilibrium conditions at which
ALD processes operate unless rather high temperatures are used.
This effect increases the exposure pulse time required to
complete each half-cycle.
According to the calculated free energies, the stability of the
adsorbed complexes decreases relative to the reactants as the
temperature is increased. Furthermore, temperature only slightly
affects the free energy of the products relative to the reactants,
except when two gas-phase byproduct molecules are produced.
At high temperatures, the free energies of the products become
lower than the free energies of the adsorbed complexes.
However, the activation free energies relative to the reactants
increase with temperature. Therefore, although raising the
temperature decreases the population of the trapped intermedi-
ates, the net reaction rates are reduced, and higher exposures
are required in each half-cycle to saturate the surface.
There are three pathways for the reaction of Hf(OEt) 4 with
surface hydroxyl sites. We find that the hydrogen-transfer
pathway (Figure 2) is kinetically the most favorable because
its rate-limiting step has the lowest activation barrier. In
particular, although the hydrogen-transfer and the ethyl group-
transfer pathways result in exactly the same products, the
activation barrier of the hydrogen-transfer pathway is much
lower. The difference in activation barriers can be explained
by classic organic chemistry principles.31 The hydrogen-transfer
reaction can be considered to be a proton-transfer reaction
between two ethoxyl groups, and the ethyl group-transfer
reaction is analogous to a nucleophilic substitution reaction. In
both cases, the ethoxyl group of the complex acts as a
nucleophile. In the transition state for hydrogen transfer, the
ethoxyl group attacks the proton of the hydroxyl group from
its back side, and the interaction is symmetry-allowed. There-
fore, the hydrogen-transfer pathway has a low activation barrier.
However, back-side attack is not favorable in the ethyl group-
transfer process because of the close proximity of the two
ethoxyl groups in the adsorbed complex. As a result, the
transition state for ethyl group transfer involves a front-side
attack of the ethyl group by the ethoxyl nucleophile, which is
symmetry-forbidden; consequently, the ethyl group-transfer
pathway involves a high activation barrier. This orbital sym-
metry argument has been used to explain the difference between
proton transfer and nucleophilic substitution reactions of meth-
ylamines on the Si(100)-2 1 surface. 32
Conclusions
We have performed a quantum chemical study of the surface
chemistry of HfO 2 ALD with Hf(OEt) 4 as the metal and oxygen
precursors. Specifically, we have calculated the energetics of
the half-reactions for HfO2 ALD. Our results show that when
Hf(OEt) 4 is used as the metal precursor the ligand-exchange
half-reactions are unactivated relative to the reactants but possess
activation barriers of 15.5 and 10.8 kcal/mol relative to the
adsorbed complexes for the metal and oxygen half-reactions,
respectively. However, when Hf(OEt) 4 is used as the oxygen
precursor, the ligand-exchange barriers are generally high, 36.5
and 36.8 kcal/mol for metal and oxygen half-reactions, respec-
tively. In addition, we find that undesirable surface reactions,
such as incomplete elimination, reaction of Hf(OEt)4 on the
ethoxyl-terminated surface, and nongrowth ligand-exchange
reactions, can compete kinetically with the ALD half-reactions.
Therefore, our results indicate that Hf(OEt)4 has several
disadvantages as an oxygen precursor. Finally, we have
discussed the relationship between general chemical principles
and the surface reaction energetics, as well as the use of organic
chemistry principles to select ALD precursors with different
reactivities.
