ABSTRACT
Being able to control the exposure of precursors to the substrate surface is essential towards an optimum Atomic
Layer Deposition (ALD) process. Conventional ALD usually requires large excess of precursors and expensive
vacuum chamber in which the precursor exposure can be controlled via the injection pulse duration followed by
a delay time. A version of ALD, namely Spatial ALD (SALD), which has the same unique assets as conventional
ALD but being faster, vacuum-free, and easier to scale up, has recently attracted much attention. In SALD,
precursors are continuously exposed to a moving surface, and thus it is more complicated to tune precursor
exposure than with conventional ALD. Here, we present a study on how to control this critical parameter for the
deposition of ZnOﬁlms using a close-proximity, open-air SALD. Our results are based on both simulations and
experiments. A simple physical model supported by Comsol Multiphysics simulations has been developed to
study the eﬀect of the substrate velocity as well as the precursor concentration in the carrier gas onﬁlm growth
rate. We found that the precursor entrainment by the moving substrate induces an asymmetric precursor con-
centration proﬁle that aﬀects the obtained GPC. Also, we show that the mass density and structural properties of
the depositedﬁlms depend closely on theﬁlm growth rate. For instance, fast growth does not always produce
dense ﬁlms. Indeed, a compromise between the growth rate and the precursor consumption should be considered
to obtain both good process eﬃciency and high-qualityﬁlms. Our ﬁndings are particularly relevant for using
SALD in large-scale coating applications, in which high deposition rate and good coating density should be
obtained with a minimal ALD precursor consumption.
1. Introduction
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been considered as one of the
best thin-ﬁlm growth technologies thanks to its capability of depositing
pinhole-free, conformal ﬁlms at relatively low temperatures [1–3].
Over the past decades, research advances have expanded the use of this
surface-controlled layer-by-layer technology beyond microelectronic
applications [4,5], including the development of biosensors[6], mate-
rials for barrier coatings [7–11] or energy conversion and storage
[12–18]. However, one of the main drawbacks of ALD is a slow growth
rate, which can be attributed to slow purging steps alternatively per-
formed between diﬀerent precursor injections[19]. Additionally, the
use of a vacuum chamber makes conventional ALD technology more
diﬃcult and expensive to scale up towards an industrial level. In this

context, a variation of ALD technique, namely spatial ALD (SALD), has
been recently attracting much attention since this ALD-based tech-
nology can be applied to deposit materials at atmospheric pressure and
low temperatures. Additionally, SALD provides very fast deposition rate
and in a scalable fashion, while keeping the unique assets of ALD
technology [20–23]. For instance, SALD is compatible with roll-to-roll
technology for fast industrial thinﬁlm deposition[24]. The key point of
an ALD technology is the possibility of thoroughly controlling the half-
reactions between precursors and the substrate surface, and at the same
time to minimize the precursor use and optimize the ALD growth rate
(expressed in the thickness of the layer deposited on the surface after
each ALD cycle, i.e. nm/cycle) [3,25]. In an ideal ALD process, a
complete monolayer of precursor molecules would be formed on the
substrate surface after each precursor exposure to the substrate surface.
In such an adsorption process, the amount of precursor being exposed
to the surface (calculated as the product of the precursor exposure time
and the precursor concentration) should be appropriately selected to
achieve the saturation state of the precursor-substrate surface reaction.
The determination of a critical value of the exposure corresponding to
such a complete ALD half-reaction is thus necessary. Indeed, since ALD
is a self-limiting process, for a given precursor concentration in the gas
phase, an exposure time longer than the critical value is not useful but
causes a waste of ALD precursors, which are commonly expensive. In
conventional ALD, the exposure time usually depends on the chamber/
sample size, the concentration of the precursors in the gas phase, the
chamber pressure, as well as the substrate temperature.
Contrarily to conventional ALD, in SALD the precursors are con-
tinuously injected onto the substrate, for instance from diﬀerent gas
outlets of an injection head. These reactive precursor regions are spa-
tially separated from mixing thanks to inert gas barriers, which are
alternatively located between the precursor regions. Given the close
distance needed between the injection head and the substrate
(~200 µm) to avoid precursor cross-talk, this kind of approach is
commonly called close-proximity SALD[26,27]. When performing
SALD with a moving substrate, the distribution of precursors to the
substrate surface will be considerably aﬀected. As a result, controlling
the precursor exposure is much more complicated in the case of SALD
than in ALD since there is no longer a deposition chamber and the
purging step is indeed substituted by passing the substrate through an
inert gas region. Obviously, the optimization of the exposure is more
critical for metal precursors than for oxidizing agents, especially for
large-scale applications since the ALD precursors are usually very ex-
pensive. In literature, several approaches related to modeling the ALD
deposition reaction, such as adsorption kinetics or surface reaction
mechanisms have been proposed[28–31]. In the case of SALD, Poodt
et al. developed a physical model to study the deposition kinetics of
Al2O3 when using a rotating SALD injection system[32], in which the
exposure time of precursors is simply supposed to be inversely pro-
portional to the rotation frequency. Also, while Denget al. proposed a
model to quantitatively link theﬁlm growth throughput and precursor
utilization, it is only based on the gasﬂows and precursor concentra-
tion, and other parameter such as the injector-substrate gap or the gas
entrainment due to the moving substrate are not taken into account
[33]. Finally, the eﬀect of the deposition parameters on the ﬁlm
properties is not discussed in previous works. Thus, in-depth studies to
link the optimization of theﬁlm growth rate with ALD precursor con-
sumption, taking into account precursor concentration, gasﬂow values,
substrate velocity and deposition gap, and discuss the properties of the
ﬁlms obtained as a function of the parameters used are still needed.
In this work, we present simulation and experimental results related
to tuning the precursor exposure to the substrate surface via the sub-
strate velocity, precursor concentration in the carrier gas and substrate/
injection head gap. The eﬀect of these parameters on the growth rate
and the physical properties of deposited ZnO thinﬁlms is thoroughly
discussed. The study has been performed for the case of ZnO deposition
using a close-proximity SALD approach. However, it can be easily
extended to any material or other SALD approaches.
2. Experimental section
The deposition of ZnOﬁlms was performed with a home-made at-
mospheric pressure spatial atomic layer deposition (AP-SALD) system
[34]. Diethylzinc (DEZ, Zn(C2H5)2 from Sigma Aldrich) and water
(H2O) were used as zinc precursor and oxidizing agent, respectively,
while nitrogen was used as carrying and purging gas. The substrate
oscillated at a constant distance of 180 µm from the injection head. All
samples were deposited on borosilicate glass substrates at a substrate
temperature of 200 °C. Such experimental conditions have been pre-
viously used to deposit thin ZnO conformal layers at the top of silver
nanowire networks to enhance both the thermal and electrical stability
of such networks (seeFig. S1 in the supporting information) [35].
Several simulation results were obtained using Comsol Multiphysics
via a combination of three modules: heat transfer inﬂuids, laminar
ﬂow, and transport of diluted species. The details related to the simu-
lations are described in part 4 of theSupporting Information. When
studying the eﬀect of the substrate velocity, other experimental para-
meters such as substrate temperature, the substrate/injection head gap,
or nitrogen bubblingﬂows through zinc precursor and water (which are
supposed to be directly related to reactant quantity carried to the in-
jection head) were maintained constant. The thickness, density, and
crystalline structure of the depositedﬁlms were investigated using an
FS‑1™ Multi-Wavelength Ellipsometer from Film Sense, an X-ray Re-
ﬂectometry system (D500 Siemens), and an X-ray Di ﬀractometry
system (D8 Advance Bruker). The texture coeﬃcients of the diﬀerent
ZnO ﬁlms were calculated from the diﬀraction peak intensities relative
to each other and to the standard powder pattern (ICSD 29272), as
follows:
=
∑
TC hkl I hkl I hkl
I hkl I hkl
() () / ()
() / ()N

where TC hkl() and Ih k l( ) are the texture coeﬃcient and the peak in-
tensity of the(hkl) reﬂection peak, respectively.Ih k l()0 is the(hkl) peak
intensity in the powder pattern (considered from ICSD 29272) andN is
the number of reﬂections present in the powder pattern (N = 4 in our
case). For a randomly oriented polycrystalline sample, the texture
coeﬃcients are equal to unity, as in the case of the powder pattern.
Conversely, for samples having a preferential orientation, the corre-
sponding texture coeﬃcient is equal toN while the other coeﬃcients
are equal to zero.
3. Theory
An ideal ALD process should provide a single monolayer of pre-
cursor after each successive exposure. However, when precursor mo-
lecules from the gas phase impinge on the substrate surface and begin to
stick, a complete monolayer may not be formed due to several factors
including the steric hindrance of bulky precursors[36], or the balance
between absorption and desorption kinetics of precursor molecules
(which depends on the deposition pressure, substrate temperature, and
precursor concentration in the gas phase). For a given precursor and
deposition pressure and temperature, the eﬀect of the precursor con-
centration in the gas phase on the ALD growth of ZnOﬁlm can easily be
understood. In the case of the ZnO deposition presented here, we
maintained suﬃcient water supply to ensure surface water saturation.
The nitrogen bubblingﬂow through DEZ container was then varied to
study the eﬀect of the concentration of DEZ con the growth rate of ZnO
ﬁlms.
Using a simple model based on Langmuir isotherm adsorption and
desorption curves [37], the growth rate of ZnO at a constant tem-
perature can be theoretically calculated. Beθt( ) the fraction of the
surface covered at the timet, the variation of this quantity is simply the

follows:

where ka, kd and DEZ[ ] refer to the rate constants for the adsorption and
desorption processes, and the gas phase concentration of the molecular
species (in this case is zinc precursor,DEZ), respectively. This equation
can be easily solved, giving the expression of the fraction of surface
covered (with the boundary condition (==θt(0 ) 0 ):

(3)
In the case of SALD, the deposition is usually carried out at low
temperatures and under atmospheric pressure. It can therefore be
classed as a high-pressure process. As aﬁrst approximation, we as-
sumed that the desorption rate is small compared to the adsorption rate
during the precursor exposure time. Hence, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as:
=− −θt k D E Zt() 1 e x p ( [ ])a (4)
We assume that theGPC is proportional to the fraction of surface
coverage θ after each precursor exposure, which is associated with the
exposure time, also called residence timetres, calculated from the sub-
strate velocity. Therefore, the dependence of GPC on precursor ex-
posure can be simply expressed as follows:
=− −GPC DEZ t K k DEZ t([ ], ) [1 exp( [ ] )]res a res1 (5)
where K1 is a constant corresponding to the static growth rate,GPC0,
when using a suﬃciently long exposure.
A typical 3D scheme of a SALD injection head is shown inFig. 1a.
The head, which is placed at a short distance from the moving sub-
strate, delivers the reactive precursors onto the substrate surface to
reproduce ALD cycles, i.e. DEZ/ N2/H 2O/ N2 and so on. If the substrate
is immobile and placed close enough to the injection head, Comsol
Multiphysics simulation shows that the reactants can be adequately
separated from mixing, as shown by gas velocity and precursor con-
centration proﬁle inFig. 1b and c, respectively, and by previous reports
[38]. In the close-proximity SALD approach, the precursor exposure
depends on several parameters including substrate velocity (ν), the
distance between two adjacent exhaust channels next to the precursor
outlets (noteddDEZ or dH O2 as shown inFig. 1c), the concentration of
precursor in the gas phase (DEZ[ ] or HO[ ]2 ), the gasﬂow through each
channel, as well as the distance between the injection head and the
substrate (dgap).
As aﬁrst approximation, at a givenDEZ[ ], when the substrate moves
at a speedν (cm/s), every point on the substrate will be exposed to DEZ-
containing gas during a so-called residence time, =t dv /res DEZ , where
dDEZ is the distance between two adjacent exhaust channels, as shown in
Fig. 1c(dDEZ = 2.5 mm in the design shown inFig. 1a). Therefore,GPC
versus substrate velocity (ν) can be expressed as follows:

In practice, the precursor concentration in the gas phase,DEZ[ ],i s
not easily accessible but it is assumed to be proportional to the nitrogen
bubbling ﬂow through DEZ, denoted fDEZ. Therefore, Eq. (6) can be
rewritten as:

(7)
where K2 is a constant proportional to the rate constant for the
adsorption reaction. This simple equation can be used to study the ef-
fect of the substrate velocity or DEZ bubblingﬂow on the ZnO growth
while keeping the other parameters constant. We will see later that the
DEZ delivered to the substrate surface is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the
substrate velocity, leading to a spatial redistribution of the precursor
along the substrate surface. The gas molecules at the substrate surface
are indeed entrained by the movement of the latter. This eﬀect will be
discussed in the next part with simulation and experimental results.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Eﬀect of precursor concentration
As mentioned previously, ALD precursors being usually expensive,
an excess injection of precursors to the substrate surface is not desir-
able. It may also lead to unexpected eﬀects such as precursor con-
densation or etching, as schematically represented in Fig. 2a. The
condensation eﬀect is more favorable at high deposition pressure and
low-temperature [37], which is indeed the case of AP-SALD.
Fig. 2b shows the experimentally obtainedGPCas a function offDEZ
and the corresponding ﬁtting curve using the simple Langmuir ad-
sorption kinetics model presented in Eq. (7). In this experiment, the
substrate temperature (200 °C), the injector/substrate gap (180 µm),
the substrate velocity (5 cm/s), or the N2 purging ﬂow (150 sccm) was
maintained constant and onlyfDEZ varies. Theﬁrst ﬁtting parameterK1
represents the growth rate at the saturating state of the substrate sur-
face, whileK dv /DEZ2 represents a constant depending on the volatility,
the adsorption coeﬃcient of DEZ[ ] and the substrate velocity. Theﬁt
results in a growth rate value at the saturating state of the substrate
surface of 0.235 nm/cycle, which is comparable to the values found in
the literature [39]. The ﬁtting quality is good for low fDEZ values.
However, for higher values (fDEZ > 30 sccm), the growth rate becomes
faster and cannot be appropriatelyﬁtted using the simple model any-
more. This might stem from precursor condensation for high fDEZ

values. It could also originate from the use of a constant N2 purging
ﬂow (150 sccm) which is no longer suﬃcient to remove the excess of
DEZ (given the increasingﬂow of gas through the DEZ channels).
The structural properties of the deposited ZnOﬁlms with varying
precursor concentration were evaluated using X-ray diﬀraction (XRD).
Fig. 3a shows an increase of the XRD peak intensities of ZnOﬁlms
versus fDEZ, which is mainly due to the thickness eﬀect. We remark that
the samples deposited with small fDEZ values ([10 sccm, 30 sccm])
exhibit similar crystalline nanostructure with (100) reﬂection as the
dominant peak. The texture coeﬃcients corresponding to (110) and
(002) reﬂection peaks are rather close to each other, while the value
for the (100) peak is almost twice higher, as shown inFig. 3b. In the
cases of fDEZ > 30 sccm, the (002) reﬂection peak appears more in-
tense compared to the (100) peak, which can also be visualized by an
abrupt variation in the texture coeﬃcient. In summary, the precursor
concentration in the gas phase, which is related tofDEZ in our case, has
a signiﬁcant impact not only on theﬁlm growth rate but also on the
nanostructure of the depositedﬁlms. Thus, while it has been shown that
close-proximity SALD can be used in CVD mode[38,40], care must be
taken to ensure that the properties of the depositedﬁlms are still ac-
ceptable for the targeted applications. The ALD condition can thus be
achieved by placing thefDEZ value in an appropriate range ([25 sccm,
30 sccm]) to reach the ALD saturation condition while avoiding any
precursor condensation.
4.2. Eﬀect of substrate velocity on GPC andﬁlm properties
Fig. 4a shows a 2D Comsol Multiphysics simulation of the DEZ
concentration proﬁle at the corresponding injection channel for dif-
ferent values of substrate velocity, i.e. from 0 cm/s to 16 cm/s. In the
case of an immobile substrate, the DEZ concentration pro ﬁle is
symmetric and centered between the two DEZ exhaust channels ad-
jacent to the DEZ channel. When the substrate is moving beneath the
gas injector (to the right in this illustration), the precursor molecules
are entrained by the moving substrate, creating an asymmetric con-
centration proﬁle, as observed inFig. 4a.
As a consequence, the simple relationship between the precursor
exposure and the substrate velocity previously shown Eq. (6) is no
longer appropriate to describe the dependence of the GPC versus the
substrate velocity and therefore needs a better approach. Although the
precursor concentration in the gas phase is not constant in the vertical
direction, the fraction of precursor molecules, that eﬃciently partici-
pate in ALD half-reactions, concerns only theﬁrst layers in contact with
the substrate.Fig. 4b shows this fraction for various substrate velocities.
As the substrate velocity increases, both an asymmetry and a decrease
in DEZ concentration are observed. This can be attributed to two main
reasons: i) the gas-entraining eﬀect caused by the moving substrate, and
ii) the presence of two adjacent exhaust channels located next to the
DEZ outlet. Although the high velocity of the substrate could facilitate
the mixture of DEZ and H2O in the gas phase, thus enhancing a CVD
contribution to theﬁlm growth, our simulations show that this is not
the case (see part 3 of theSupporting Informationfor details).
In an ideal case, the substrate surface would be exposed to a con-
stant concentration of DEZ, namely DEZ[ ]input as shown in Fig. 4c,
during a constant exposure time that is simply equal to the ratio of the
distance between two adjacent exhaust channels,dDEZ, to the substrate
velocity, v. In such a case, the precursor exposure to the substrate
surface would be calculated as follows:

velocity, substrate temperature, and injector/
substrate gap wereﬁxed at 5 cm/s, 200 °C, and
180 µm, respectively.

in Fig. 4c. However, the simulation shows that the precursor con-
centration proﬁles are not simply constant but quite complex and
shifted to the direction of substrate motion. InFig. 4c, we suggest a
more meticulous estimation of the eﬀective exposure of DEZ to the
substrate surface by discretizing the DEZ[ ] proﬁles into N small seg-
ments indicated by coordinatesx0, x1…xN.I fN is large enough, the
precursor concentration in each segment +xx[ ,]ii 1 can be considered
constant and the exposure of the precursor to this portion of the sub-
strate would indeed be equal toDEZ x d x[ ]( ) ·i . Therefore, we deﬁne an
eﬀective exposure,Exeffective, which can be calculated as follows:

represents the area under the DEZ[ ]
proﬁle.
Fig. 5a illustrates the eﬀective exposure as a function of the sub-
strate velocity (data obtained from Comsol Multiphysics simulation).
Interestingly, the behavior ofADEZ[] versus substrate velocity,ν, can be
appropriately ﬁtted by using a second-order polynomial regression
without the linear term as aﬁrst approximation to reduce the number of
ﬁtting parameters to only A0 and kss: =−AA k v ·DEZ ss[] 0 2. Here, A0
corresponds to the symmetric DEZ[ ] distribution under the precursor
channel when the substrate is immobile (ν=0 cm/s).kss is a constant
depending on many parameters including the DEZ concentration in the
gas phase, the viscosity of the mixed gas, as well as the substrate
temperature. According to this simulation result, the exposure shown in
the Eq (6) is not simply inversely proportional to the substrate velocity,
but there exists an eﬀective exposure, as shown inFig. 5a. Hence, a new
physical approach towardsGPC ν( ) can be calculated as follows:

The right side of Eq. (10) can be simpliﬁed by setting =Xk Aa 0 and
=Yk kas s . Fig. 5b shows the experimental data and correspondingﬁt-
ting curves using Eq. (10) for theGPCof ZnOﬁlms deposited at diﬀerent
DEZ[ ] values as a function of substrate velocity,ν. Our model properly
ﬁts the data of the high and intermediate substrate velocities for various
DEZ bubbling ﬂow rates (15, 30 and 50 sccm). Conversely, it can be
observed that the growth rates deviate from the theoretical model at
low substrate velocities, which correspond to the longer exposure time.
As discussed inFig. 2, an extra injection of precursors to the substrate
surface can create condensation if the subsequent purging step is not
suﬃciently long. This fact was not taken into account in our simple
model, yielding an underestimation of the growth rate at low substrate
velocities. The same argument could also explain the increase of the
static growth rate,K1, obtained at higher values offDEZ (30 or 50 sccm
compared to 15 sccm). Indeed, the N2 purging ﬂow should be adapted
for each value offDEZ and substrate velocity. However, in this work, it
was maintained constant at 150 sccm to keep the gasﬂow balance at all
the outlets of the injection head. Consequently, this value may not be
suﬃcient to purge the excess physisorbed precursor molecules in the
case of high DEZ[ ]. Concerning theﬁtting parameters, whileK1 is as-
sociated with the static growth rate,X and Y do not have a direct
physical meaning. On the contrary, the ratio betweenY and X is equal
to the ratio betweenA0 and kss, which can be related to the eﬀective
exposure tres

where =vY X /c is a characteristic velocity (cm/s). Intuitively, when
the substrate velocity approaches this critical value, the eﬀective ex-
posure would rapidly decrease, which yields a lower growth rate. The
summary of the parameters extracted from theﬁts is shown inTable 1.
The static growth rate obtained when using the value offDEZ equal to
30 sccm is about 0.27 nm/cycle, which is indeed similar to the value
obtained in a conventional thermal ALD process at atmospheric pres-
sure [39].
In general, experimental parameters should be optimized to obtain a
fast deposition rate, which is indeed a compromise between a high
substrate velocity and a long enough residence time. Therefore, ac-
cording to Eqs. (7) and (8), high values ofkss and vc are expected. Since
kss characterizes how easily the DEZ ﬂow can be entrained by the
moving substrate, the observed decreasing trend ofkss versus fDEZ in-
dicates that the growth rate of ZnO is less aﬀected by the substrate
velocity if higher DEZ bubbling ﬂow is used. The opposite trend is
observed forvc. A higher value of this characteristic velocity is expected
given the fact that a fast substrate velocity can be used while main-
taining a constanttres
eff. From another point of view, the optimization of
the SALD process concerns the improvement of the growth rate with as
little precursor consumption as possible. Three pivotal parameters
should be taken into account: growth rateGPC (nm/cycle), precursor
consumption that is directly proportional tofDEZ (sccm) and deposition
time tdep (s), of which the latter is related to the substrate velocityv
(cm/s). Let ηdep denote a parameter combining these factors, namely
process eﬃciency, and be written as follows:
=η GPC v

·
dep
DEZ (12)
Fig. 6describes the variation of process eﬃciency ηdep as a function
of the time required to perform a constant number of cycles (for ex-
ample 100 cycles in this illustration). It can be calculated by using the
experimental data shown inFig. 5b. A longer deposition time corre-
sponds to a slower substrate velocity and leads to a high precursor
consumption, which makes, in general, a low process eﬃciency. On the
other hand, using the low value offDEZ (15 sccm) can save precursor,
however, the disadvantage is a longer deposition time to maintain a
constant process eﬃciency. Remarkably, using a moderate value offDEZ
(30 sccm) yields a signiﬁcantly higher value of eﬃciency ηdep. This in-
teresting observation provides a guide on how to optimize the SALD
deposition process by controlling at the same time the precursor con-
sumption and the deposition time.
Apart from the growth rate, other important features that have to be
considered such asﬁlm density.Fig. 7a shows the X-ray Reﬂectometry
(XRR) patterns of ZnOﬁlms deposited at various substrate velocities in
the range of [3.3, 8.3 cm/s], from which two important parameters can
be extracted, i.e.ﬁlm mass density and thickness. This range of sub-
strate velocities generates a variation inﬁlm thickness from 27.5 nm to
60 nm, which corresponds to GPC values in between [0.15, 0.33 nm/
cyc]. Fig. 7b shows the dependence of the mass density of the deposited
ZnO ﬁlms on the growth rate. An optimum range of GPC values cor-
responding to a maximum mass density of 5.42 g/cm3 can be appre-
ciated, while the bulk value is expected to be 5.61 g/cm3. For high GPC
values (≥0.3 nm/cycle), the lower mass density of the depositedﬁlms
can be related to excess precursor physisorbed on the substrate surface,
making somehow a mixed CVD-ALD deposition mode rather than a
pure ALD mode. In the case of slower growth rates (< 0.2 nm/s),
corresponding to non-saturating ALD surface reaction, the low mass
density values could be related to theﬁlm thickness eﬀect. Indeed, ZnO
thin ﬁlms prepared by SALD at 200 °C using diethylzinc result in

polycrystalline structure, in which the grain size (and therefore theﬁlm
density) signiﬁcantly depends on theﬁlm thickness. The dependence of
the optical properties of ZnOﬁlms deposited by SALD on the substrate
velocity is also discussed in part 2 of theSupporting Information.
5. Conclusions
In this work, simulation and experimental studies have been con-
ducted to study the eﬀect of a critical parameter, namely, precursor
exposure in the case of a close-proximity spatial atomic layer deposition
(SALD) approach. This parameter depends directly on the substrate
velocity, the geometric design of the injection head, as well as the
carrier gas ﬂow rate. A simple physical model has been developed to
study the eﬀect of the substrate velocity and the precursor concentra-
tion in the carrier gas (DEZ[ ]) on the growth rate of the deposited ZnO
ﬁlms. Comsol Multiphysics results show that the entrainment of the
precursor molecules by the moving substrate induces an asymmetry in
the DEZ[ ] proﬁle that aﬀects the obtained growth per cycle (GPC).
When studying thoroughly the experimental data based on the eﬀect of
DEZ[ ] and the substrate velocity at constantDEZ[ ], we found that an
excess of physisorbed precursor molecules on the substrate surface in
the case of highDEZ[ ] can be indirectly observed via the clear variation
of theﬁlm growth rate when either increasingDEZ[ ] or decreasing the
substrate velocity beyond a certain value. The agreement between ex-
perimental observations and the model appears very good. Finally, we
have also shown that the mass density of the deposited ZnOﬁlms de-
pends closely on the substrate velocity, and that a fast growth rate does
not always produce denseﬁlms. Indeed, a compromise between growth
rate and precursor consumption should be considered to obtain both a
highﬁlm density and a good process eﬃciency, of which the latter is
proposed for theﬁrst time to quantify such analysis in SALD. The simple
and original approach presented can pave the way to better understand
thin-ﬁlm growth using any SALD system, since it provides a compre-
hensive guide on optimizing growth rate,ﬁlm density, and precursor
consumption. This is indeed crucial when using SALD for large-scale
coating applications.
