ABSTRACT: Area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) is
rapidly gaining interest because of its potential application in
self-aligned fabrication schemes for next-generation nano-
electronics. Here, we introduce an approach for area-selective
ALD that relies on the use of chemoselective inhibitor
molecules in a three-step (ABC-type) ALD cycle. A process
for area-selective ALD of SiO2 was developed comprising
acetylacetone inhibitor (step A), bis(diethylamino)silane
precursor (step B), and O2 plasma reactant (step C) pulses.
Our results show that this process allows for selective
deposition of SiO2 on GeO2, SiNx, SiO2, and WO3, in the
presence of Al2O3, TiO2, and HfO2 surfaces. In situ Fourier
transform infrared spectrosc opy experiments and density
functional theory calculations underline that the selectivity of the approach stems from the chemoselective adsorption
of the inhibitor. The selectivity between diﬀerent oxide starting surfaces and the compatibility with plasma-assisted or
ozone-based ALD are distinct features of this approach. Furthermore, the approach oﬀers the opportunity of tuning the
substrate-selectivity by proper selection of inhibitor molecules.

irecting matter to create structures with atomic-level
control of physical and chemical properties is a long
sought-after goal in nanotechnology. The deposition
of atoms at speciﬁc locations on a surface can boost advances in
catalysis,1−3 energy harvesting, 4 and semiconductor device
fabrication.5 Today, the semiconductor industry is one of the
main driving forces that pushes for advancing theﬁeld of area-
selective deposition.6,7 As the state-of-the-art technology is
entering the sub-10-nm scale, the conventional patterning of
thin ﬁlms is becoming extremely challenging in terms of
atomic-scale precision and reliable processing. Current semi-
conductor manufacturing requires many lithography and
etching steps to fabricate multilayered 3D devices with perfectly
aligned features.8 Especially alignment issues leading to the so-
called edge placement errors (EPEs) have become the prime
bottleneck for continued downscaling.9 Therefore, innovative
bottom-up techniques are required to replace or complement
top-down fabrication schemes.
One of the main emerging solutions is to implement self-
aligned fabrication schemes, in which a material is deposited on
a predetermined area in a selective manner. Area-selective
deposition will reduce the number of photolithography and
etching steps and thereby enable cost-eﬀective options to create
these structures in a bottom-up approach. Hence, a signiﬁcant
eﬀort is underway in both industry and academia to develop
robust area-selective deposition techniques.10
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) enables layer-by-layer growth
with atomic-level thickness control. The technique relies on the
cyclewise and alternate exposure of a substrate to various vapor-
phase precursors that undergo self-limiting surface reactions,
thereby allowing for uniform and 3D-conformalﬁlm deposi-
tion.11 However, ALD typically leads to deposition on the
entire surface, and therefore the process needs to be adapted to
enable area-selective deposition.7,12−15 To date, most of the
eﬀorts in the ﬁeld of area-selective ALD include substrate
patterning steps before the area-selective ALD.12,16,17 On the

other hand, in self-aligned fabrication, a partially processed
device architecture is taken as the starting point, where
patterning has been performed in a previous processing step.
Thus, the sample surface consists of several diﬀerent materials,
and the challenge is to selectively deposit on the surface of only
one or a subset of these materials. The area-selective ALD
processes developed so far often concern metal-on-metal or
oxide-on-oxide deposition.18−21 However, self-aligned fabrica-
tion can also require other material combinations to be
deposited in an area-selective manner. For example, some
applications might demand area-selective ALD on a speciﬁc
metal oxide in the presence of other oxide surfaces.
In this work, an approach for area-selective ALD is
introduced. It is based on a three-step (ABC-type) ALD
cycle, where step A is the exposure of the surface to inhibitor
molecules, and B and C are the steps of a regular ALD process.
Earlier investigations in chemical vapor deposition illustrate
some of the advantages of using inhibitors for achieving area-
selective deposition.22 Our approach is inspired by the work of
Yanguas-Gil et al., who used inhibitor molecules (e.g., ethanol,
acetone, hexane) in ABC-type ALD cycles to improve the
doping eﬃciency in ALD-grown materials. 23 Instead of
reducing the growth per cycle by partial blocking of the
adsorption sites for the precursor molecule,23 we intend to
completely block precursor adsorption on speci ﬁc starting
materials.
Our approach for achieving area-selective ALD is illustrated
in Figure 1. In step A, we use an inhibitor molecule that
selectively adsorbs on certain materials on which no deposition
is desired (referred to as the non-growth area). The inhibitor
blocks the precursor adsorption during the subsequent step B.
The cycle is completed in step C by removing the precursor
ligands together with the inhibitor molecules and by activating
the surface for the next cycle. This approach should ideally
allow for area-selective ALD on surfaces where the inhibitor
does not adsorb (referred to as the growth area).
A pronounced beneﬁt of this approach is that the selectivity
no longer relies solely on the chemoselective adsorption of an
ALD precursor on a speciﬁc surface. Chemoselective
adsorption is decoupled from the precursor by inserting an
inhibitor step, and this will therefore yield more freedom for
developing area-selective ALD processes. Similar to previous
work on the application of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
for area-selective ALD, this approach relies on the blocking of
surface sites for precursor adsorption. However, the main
diﬀerence is that the inhibitor molecules are reapplied every
single cycle, which can potentially lead to a more robust
approach that does not suﬀer from a gradual degradation of the
blocking layer.13 Another advantage of reapplying the inhibitor
every cycle is that it renders area-selective deposition
compatible with (or accessible to) more types of ALD
processes, including plasma-assisted or ozone-based ALD.
This will therefore extend the set of materials that can be
deposited by ALD in an area-selective manner.
In this article, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept for using
ABC-type ALD cycles to achieve area-selective ALD of SiO2,a
low-κ material that is ubiquitous in many devices. The process
consists of acetylacetone (abbreviated in the literature as
Hacac) as the inhibitor, bis(diethylamino)silane (BDEAS) as
the Si precursor, and O2 plasma as the co-reactant. In contrast
to previous area-selective ALD studies in which typically only
two surfaces were considered, the nucleation behavior of this
ABC-type ALD process is investigated here on as many as 14
diﬀerent starting surfaces. As a proof-of-concept, the process
was tested on patterned Al 2O3/GeO2 samples, and the
selectivity was probed using s urface analysis techniques.
Theoretical calculations as well as in situ studies were
performed to determine the mechanistic aspects of the
chemoselective inhibitor adsorption and the precursor blocking.
The basic understanding obtained this way can be used to
further improve the selectivity of the current approach. Finally,
the opportunities enabled by this area-selective ALD approach
will be discussed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Impact of Hacac Adsorption on SiO 2 Nucleation.
Saturation curves for the ABC-type ALD cycle, included in the
Supporting Information(Figure S1), demonstrate that the
saturation behavior and the growth per cycle are not inﬂuenced
by the addition of the Hacac step. ABC-type ALD cycles of
SiO2 were carried out on various starting surfaces to identify on
which surfaces deposition of SiO2 is obtained and on which
ones it is blocked. Figure 2 depicts the nucleation curves as
measured byin situspectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The graph
shows that SiO2 grows without any nucleation delay on GeO2,
SiO2,W O3, and SiNx. On these substrates a growth per cycle of
approximately 0.09 nm/cycle was obtained. This is comparable
to the growth per cycle of the regular two-step ALD process,
consisting of BDEAS precursor and O2 plasma pulses (referred
to as the BC process).24 Figure 2also shows that growth delays
for ABC-type ALD of SiO2 are observed on Al2O3 (15 cycles),
TiO2, and HfO2 (both 10 cycles). The growth delay of 15
cycles that is obtained when using the ABC-type cycles on
Al2O3 means that a SiO2 ﬁlm of ∼1 nm thickness can be
selectively deposited on GeO 2 in the presence of Al 2O3.
Nucleation curves for the BC process are shown inFigure S2,
demonstrating that there is no nucleation delay for the regular
Figure 1. Schematic illustration of an ideal area-selective ALD
process using ABC-type ALD cycles with inhibitor molecules. The
starting point is a patterned surface with two diﬀerent materials:
the growth area on which selective deposition is desired, and the
non-growth area on which deposition should not occur. In step A,
the inhibitor molecules selectively adsorb on the non-growth area.
These inhibitor molecules block the precursor adsorption in step B,
such that precursor molecules adsorb only on the growth area. This
results in area-selective deposition on the growth area after removal
of the precursor ligands and inhibitor molecules in step C. By
repeating the cycles, material can be deposited by ALD area-
selectively. It should be noted that in reality some inhibitor
adsorption could still be allowed on the growth area, provided the
growth rate and/or material properties of the depositedﬁlm are not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected.

ALD process on these starting materials. Additional data for
ABC-type ALD cycles of SiO2 on Pd, Pt, Ru, ZnO, FeOx,
MoOx, and CoOx starting surfaces, presented in Figure S3a,
show immediate deposition on Pd, short nucleation delays (of
∼5 cycles) on Ru, ZnO, FeOx, and Pt, and longer delays (of
∼8−12 cycles) on MoOx and CoOx. Figure S3b depicts that
the deposition temperature also plays a role in determining the
extent of the nucleation delay, and slightly better results were
obtained at 200°C.
To gain insights into the inhibited deposition on Al2O3 and
the immediate deposition on SiO 2, SE measurements were
conducted after every individual subcycle.Figure 3a,b show the
results for a sequence of AC, ABC, and BC cycles on Al2O3 and
SiO2 starting surfaces. Similar data are presented for other
starting surfaces such as TiO2, GeO2, and HfO2 in Figure S4.
The data for the AC cycles on Al2O3 in Figure 3a show a
thickness increase after each A step and a decrease after every
subsequent C step. This suggests that Hacac adsorbs on Al2O3
and can be removed by an O2 plasma pulse. The thickness
increase does not correspond directly to the thickness of the
Hacac monolayer, because its dielectric function is unknown
and not taken into account in the SE modeling. However, the
thickness increase can be considered as a measure for the
amount of adsorbed material and is therefore represented as an
apparent thickness.25 Pulse C removes the adsorbed Hacac by
combustion reactions and prepares the surface for the
subsequent cycle. The thickness does not decrease completely
to zero during theﬁrst O2 plasma step, which is attributed to a
slight change of the optical response of the underlying Al2O3
ﬁlm aﬀecting the ellipsometry modeling. The middle part of
Figure 3a representing the ABC cycles indicates that after
exposing the Al2O3 surface to Hacac (A), no signiﬁcant amount
of BDEAS adsorption takes place (B). Conversely, when
exposing the Al2O3 surface to BDEAS (B) and O2 plasma (C),
as shown at the right-hand side in the graph, there is a net
thickness increase indicating deposition of SiO2 with a growth
per cycle of∼0.09 nm/cycle.
Marked diﬀerences are observed when performing AC and
ABC cycles on a SiO2 substrate (Figure 3b). There is virtually
no change in apparent thickness during AC cycles on SiO2,
which indicates that Hacac adsorbs, at most, in minute and
ineﬀective amounts on a SiO2 surface. Consequently, ABC-type
cycles on SiO2 result in the same growth per cycle (∼0.09 nm/
cycle) as observed for regular ALD using BC cycles. This
demonstrates that the addition of Hacac does not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the SiO2 deposition on SiO2 starting surfaces. To
conclude, Figure 3suggests that the selectivity of the ABC-type
process stems from the chemoselective adsorption of Hacac
and that Hacaconce adsorbed eﬀectively blocks the
precursor adsorption.
Proof-of-Concept of Area-Selective Deposition.ABC-
type ALD of SiO2 was performed on Al2O3 and GeO2 surfaces.
GeO2 was selected as a starting surface because it shows similar
behavior to SiO2; that is, the addition of an Hacac pulse to the
cycle does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the deposition of SiO2 on this
surface. Moreover, the GeO2 surface allows for quantiﬁcation of
the amount of SiO 2 deposited using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of- ﬂight secondary ion mass
spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). Figure S5 shows the Si 2p signals
for SiO2 after 12, 15, and 21 ABC-type ALD cycles of SiO2 on
both GeO2 and Al2O3 starting surfaces. After 15 ABC-type
ALD cycles the ratio of the Si 2p integrated peak areas on
Al2O3 and GeO2 is ∼0.11. Consistent with the SE data, the
integrated peak areas for the Si 2p peak conﬁrm the blocking
eﬀect of Hacac.
The selectivity was further investigated on a patterned
Al2O3/GeO2 sample. To this end, an ALD-prepared Al2O3 layer
Figure 2. Nucleation curves for ABC-type ALD of SiO2 on diﬀerent
starting surfaces. The graphs show the thickness as a function of the
number of ALD cycles as measured byin situ SE. We note that due
to the use of an O2 plasma as the co-reactant, the topmost layer of
the starting surfaces can be oxidized during the ﬁrst few ALD
cycles, which was accounted for in the SE modeling of SiNx.

dosing pulse on (a) Al2O3 and (b) SiO2. The left-hand part of the
ﬁgure represents 3 AC cycles with Hacac (A) and O2 plasma (C)
pulses, the middle part 3 ABC cycles with Hacac (A), BDEAS
precursor (B), and O2 plasma (C) pulses, and the right-hand part 3
BC cycles with BDEAS precursor (B) and O2 plasma (C) pulses.
The apparent thickness is used to reﬂect that the SE modeling did
not take into account the dielectric function of the surface groups
such that the thickness after step A might not correspond to the
physical thickness.25 The starting surfaces were prepared by regular
ALD.

Figure 4a−c show the TOF-SIMS elemental mapping images
for the Ge+,A l+, and Si+ secondary ions for the patterned
sample after 15 ABC-type ALD cycles of SiO2. The mappings
conﬁrm that ALD of SiO 2 occurred predominantly on the
GeO2 regions. The line scans, presented inFigure 4d, show a
high Si+ signal in the regions not covered by Al2O3, indicating
area-selective deposition of SiO2 on GeO2. Only a very small
amount of Si is also present on Al2O3, which was quantiﬁed to
correspond to a 0.01 nm thick SiO2 layer, as derived from
calibration measurements (see the Methods section). Also,
lateral broadening of∼1 nm, the so-calledmushrooming effect,i s
expected to take place given the nature of the ALD technique.
This will mainly impact (and be observable for) nanoscale
patterns, and the eﬀect will be investigated on such samples in
future work.
Surface Chemistry of the ABC SiO2 ALD Process. In
order to investigate the Hacac and BDEAS adsorption on SiO2
and Al 2O3 starting surfaces, in situ infrared absorption
spectroscopy experiments were performed on pellet-pressed
SiO2 powder using a Fourier transformed spectrometer
(FTIR). To this end, the SiO2 powder was ﬁrst coated using

ALD of SiO2 on (a) an Al2O3-coated substrate and (b) a SiO2-coated substrate. The graph for Al2O3 shows the adsorption of a large amount of
Hacac and the blocking of BDEAS precursor adsorption during the subsequent pulse. The graph for SiO2 reveals that only a small amount of
Hacac adsorbs on SiO2, which does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the adsorption of the BDEAS precursor. The spectra collected after steps A and B
are both referenced to the starting surface (i.e., Al2O3 and SiO2).

30 ALD cycles of SiO2 or Al2O3, respectively. FTIR spectra
were collected after coating the powder and after the
subsequent Hacac and the BDEAS dosing steps. Figure 5a
shows the results on Al2O3 as diﬀerence spectra, using the
spectrum collected after Al2O3 coating as the reference. The
results conﬁrm that Hacac adsorbs on Al2O3, as indicated by
the absorption peaks in the wavenumber range 1300−1650
cm−1.26,27 Subsequent dosing of BDEAS precursor causes only
a minor change in the spectrum, which con ﬁrms that the
preadsorbed Hacac molecules act as inhibitors and block the
impinging BDEAS molecules from chemisorbing onto the
Al2O3 surface. It is estimated that the minor change
corresponds to a fraction of ∼8% of the amount of BDEAS
molecules adsorbed on bare Al2O3. This indicates that Hacac is
not fully eﬀective in blocking the precursor adsorption.
A similar experiment on the SiO 2-coated sample, using
identical Hacac and BDEAS dosing times, revealed a distinctly
diﬀerent behavior, as shown in Figure 5b. Now, only 8% of
Hacac adsorbs on SiO2 as compared to the amount that adsorbs
on the Al2O3-coated surface. Consequently, the adsorption of
BDEAS is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected on this surface, as shown by
the large (positive) absorption peaks. BDEAS adsorption
results in positive peaks in the wavenumber ranges 2800 −
3000 cm−1 and 2130−2240 cm−1, originating from the C−H
and Si −H stretching vibrations of the adsorbed BDEAS
molecules.28,29 Concurrently, there is a loss of absorbance
around 3740 cm −1, characteristic for the O −H stretching
vibrations of the surface hydroxyl groups that are consumed
during BDEAS precursor adsorption.28,30
In conclusion, the FTIR studies con ﬁrm that Hacac
selectively adsorbs on Al 2O3 and subsequently inhibits the
BDEAS adsorption. Yet, the studies also provide insights for
further improvement of the process that will be discussed
below.
Mechanism Underpinning the Chemoselective Ad-
sorption of the Hacac Inhibitor.Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations were performed to better understand the
mechanism of the chemoselective Hacac adsorption at a
molecular level. Hydroxylated surfaces ofα-Al2O3 (0001) and
α-SiO2 (0001) were employed to represent the experimentally
used Al2O3 and SiO2 surfaces. The calculations revealed that
Hacac prefers to bind in a chelate con ﬁguration on both
surfaces, with both of its oxygen atoms bonded to Al3+/Si4+
surface sites. Alternative binding con ﬁgurations were also
found, as discussed below. Concertedly, H2O is predicted to
form as a byproduct on both surfaces through a proton transfer
to a hydroxyl surface group. The H2O byproduct is expected to
stick to the surface, where it plays an important role in
stabilizing the chemisorbed acac − product through H-bond
interactions (see Supporting Information, Figure S7 and the
accompanying discussion).
The structures and associated relative energies were
calculated for the stationary points along the suitable reaction
pathways (i.e., minimum energy paths) for the adsorption of
the Hacac inhibitor on Al2O3 and SiO2 (Figure 6). For theﬁrst
step in Hacac binding, i.e., physisorption, two distinctive
binding orientations were identiﬁed by the DFT calculations
(horizontal and vertical; seeFigure S6and detailed description
in theSupporting Information). As evident fromFigure 6a, the
dissociative binding of Hacac on Al2O3 is associated with an
overall exothermic reaction with an energy gain of 0.49 eV. The
chemisorption involves the formation of an intermediate
complex through a slightly exothermic ( ΔE = −0.07 eV)
process with near-zero barrier (Ea ≈ 0.01 eV). The intermediate
complex comprises Hacac that is bonded to the Al 3+ site
through one of its oxygen atoms ( Figure S7a ). This
intermediate species is predicted to lose its hydroxyl proton
through a kinetically accessible process ( Ea = 0.25 eV),
producing a monodentate adduct (type A, Figure S7b )
alongside H 2O. However, this adduct corresponds to a
transition-state species on the energetically downhill path that
yields the chelate end-product (type B, Figure S7c) through
binding of acac− via its second oxygen to the same surface Al3+
site. Considering that the Hacac would have already gained

corresponding insets), where some oxygen and hydrogen atoms are hidden for clarity. First points of the energy proﬁles correspond to the

suﬃcient kinetic energy by physisorbing on the Al2O3 surface
(i.e., ΔEp = −0.75 eV, physisorption energy), it would readily
overcome the overall barrier of 0.25 eV and be converted to the
chelate (type B) end-product. Therefore, none of the
monodentate (type A) species (intermediate or adduct) are
expected to accumulate on the Al2O3 surface.
Similar to the Al2O3 case, a chelate (type B, Figure S7d)
species is the end-product of Hacac adsorption on SiO 2,
whereas the monodentate (type A) complex is only a transition
state (Figure 6b). More importantly, the overall chemisorption
reaction on SiO2 is calculated to be endothermic and to require
an energy of 0.98 eV, accompanied by an extremely high kinetic
barrier (Ea = 2.35 eV). In accordance with the SE and FTIR
results, these DFTﬁndings suggest that Hacac binds readily on
hydroxylated Al2O3, while the overall reaction on hydroxylated
SiO2 is both thermodynamically and kinetically hindered. This
explains the selectivity of Hacac adsorption on Al 2O3 as
opposed to SiO2 during the ABC-type ALD of SiO2.
Role of Surface Acidity on Hacac Adsorption. The
chemoselective adsorption of Hacac on various starting surfaces
can also be interpreted in terms of surface acidity.31 This allows
explaining the results obtained on the experimentally used
starting surfaces. Hacac has a pKa value of 9.0 in aqueous
solution at 25 °C, and therefore it should behave as a weak
acid.32 A reaction with Hacac is not likely to occur with the
hydroxyl groups that possess an acidic character (e.g., SiO2).33
Conversely, hydroxyl groups with more basic character can
react with Hacac. In this framework, an acid/base surface
reaction between Hacac and the surface hydroxyl groups of a
given oxide (e.g., Al2O3) can be written as
‐* + → * +M OH Hacac M(acac) H O(g) 2 (g) (1)
where M is a generic atom of the oxide (either metal or
nonmetal) and the asterisks represent the surface species. A
generalization can be made in order to explain which surfaces
allow for the chemoselective adsorption of the Hacac inhibitor
(and potential blocking of the precursor) and which surfaces
will lead to immediate deposition instead. The acidity of an
oxide can be predicted from the electronegativity of the cation
element, M.34 The relative acidity of several oxide surfaces was
calculated using Sanderson’s electronegativity scale and the
electronegativity equalization principle, in order to explain the
data ofFigures 2 and S3, as presented in Figure S8. The
agreement of the calculated values with the experimental data
underlines that the distinct acidic/basic behavior of diﬀerent
oxide compounds governs the chemoselective adsorption of
Hacac. Therefore, this provides a framework for predicting the
area selectivity on diﬀerent starting surfaces.
Merits and Opportunities Provided by the Approach.
The approach introduced in this article shows similarities with
recent work by Engstrom and co-workers in which inhibitor
molecules are co-injected into the reactor together with the
precursor.35 Also that approach relies on in ﬂuencing the
precursor adsorption by an inhibitor molecule. The beneﬁto f
dividing the inhibitor and precursor exposure over two diﬀerent
dosing steps is that the adsorption of both molecules can reach
saturation independently, without suﬀering from competitive
adsorption eﬀects. Consequently, similar to regular two-step
ALD processes, an ABC-type ALD process should allow for the
deposition of conformalﬁlms on nanostructured surfaces.
A more natural approach for achieving area-selective ALD
would be to design dedicated ALD precursors to enable
chemoselective adsorption on materials on which deposition
should occur. However, in practice this is extremely challenging
because the precursor molecule has to contain the atom to be
deposited, while also satisfying other requirements to behave as
an eﬀective ALD precursor (in terms of stability, volatility, and
self-limiting adsorption). By using two diﬀerent molecules in an
ABC-type ALD cycle, the inhibitor provides the selectivity in
step A, without compromising the properties of the precursor
dosed in step B.
When the ABC-type ALD approach is compared to other
area-selective ALD approaches, several distinctive aspects can
be identiﬁed. As discussed in the introduction, reapplying the
inhibitor molecules every cycle can be bene ﬁcial from a
reliability point-of-view, while it also makes the approach
compatible with plasma-assisted or ozone-based ALD. More-
over, an important merit of this approach is that it distinguishes
between the growth on diﬀerent oxide surfaces (e.g., GeO2/
SiO2 versus Al2O3/HfO2/TiO2).
The FTIR studies revealed that the selectivity of the Hacac
adsorption is not perfect, since some adsorption was also
observed on SiO2. However, the amount of Hacac on SiO2 is
suﬃciently small such that it does not inﬂuence the deposition
on the growth area, as we concluded from the in situ SE
measurements (Figures 2and S1). Moreover, a small amount of
BDEAS adsorption was detectable on Al2O3 after dosing the
Hacac inhibitor. Ex situ XPS and TOF-SIMS also conﬁrmed
that a minor amount of SiO2 was deposited on Al2O3 after 15
cycles, suggesting that the adsorbed Hacac does not completely
block the precursor adsorption. This incomplete precursor
blocking can occur most likely due to the presence of (i)
surface defects or impurities that can negatively inﬂuence the
ideal inhibitor adsorption behavior; (ii) surface reactive sites
that remain accessible to the precursor; and (iii) physisorbed
water molecules on the surface that can compete with the
Hacac chemisorption, as discussed in the DFT calculations in
theSupporting Information, Figure S7. This implies that the
selectivity of the ABC-type ALD process can be further
improved by exploring diﬀerent surface preparation procedures
and by optimizing the deposition conditions. In addition,
alternative inhibitors, diﬀerent inhibitor dosing strategies, or co-
dosing two or more inhibitor molecules can be considered for
improving the selectivity. All these parameters oﬀer phys-
icochemical pathways to enhance the inhibitor surface coverage
and, therefore, maximize the blocking eﬀect during the
precursor dose step. For these reasons, we foresee that it
should be possible to signiﬁcantly improve the selectivity to the
extent it meets the requirements of semiconductor manufactur-
ing.
The ABC approach provides the opportunity of tailoring the
substrate-selectivity of an ALD process by selection of the
chemoselective inhibitor molecule. There is a wealth of
information in surface science and catalysis literature about
the adsorption of organic molecules on inorganic surfaces,36,37
which can serve as a good starting point for selecting suitable
inhibitor molecules.23 The ideal case would be to use an
inhibitor molecule that adsorbs on all surfaces, except for the
particular surface on which deposition is needed. Additional
research is required to investigate whether such selectivity is
achievable and to further explore the toolbox of using inhibitor
molecules for area-selective ALD. We expect that this approach
can enable area-selective ALD for diﬀerent materials by using
other precursors and for example H 2 or NH3 plasma co-
reactants. To this end, the interaction of the inhibitor with the
material to be deposited and with the plasma needs to be

studied. In view of the large set of possibilities, this will be the
subject of a follow-up study.
CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated the use of chemoselective inhibitors in
ABC-type ALD cycles as a route for area-selective ALD. Area-
selective ALD of SiO2 was achieved using a process consisting
of alternated Hacac inhibitor, BDEAS precursor, and O2 plasma
pulses on a GeO2 substrate with patterned Al2O3 features. SiO2
is an extremely relevant and widely employed low-κ material,
for which no area-selective ALD process is available.In situ SE
studies revealed that area-selective (i.e., noninhibited) growth
can also be obtained on WOx, SiO2, SiNx, and Pd, while there
are nucleation delays of 10−15 cycles on TiO2, HfO2, CoOx,
and MoOx. The selectivity originates from the chemoselective
adsorption of the Hacac inhibitor molecule. This was
corroborated in detail byin situ SE and FTIR experiments, as
well as by DFT calculations, and generalized by correlating the
Hacac adsorption to the acidity of the starting surface. SE and
FTIR experiments conﬁrmed that adsorbed Hacac blocks the
subsequent BDEAS precursor adsorption, thereby resulting in
area-selective deposition of SiO2 on those surfaces on which
Hacac does not adsorb.
The presented results establish a proof-of-concept for the
introduced approach and provide insight into how the
selectivity can be further improved. The SiO2 ABC-type
process oﬀers an exceptional substrate-selectivity, by distin-
guishing between diﬀerent oxide starting surfaces. We expect
that the compatibility of the approach with ozone-based or
plasma-assisted ALD, as well as the ability to tune the substrate-
selectivity by selection of the inhibitor molecule, will extend the
portfolio of materials that can be deposited by ALD in an area-
selective manner.
METHODS
ALD Processes. The depositions were carried out in an Oxford
Instruments FlexAL reactor, which is described in detail in ref38.I n
short, it is a vacuum vessel equipped with a remote inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) source, a 200 mm substrate table, a turbo-molecular
pump, and a loadlock. The SiO2 plasma-assisted ALD recipe with
BDEAS (H2Si[N(C2H5)2]2) precursor (also known as SAM.24) and
O2 plasma pulses, characterized by Dingemanset al.,24 was used as the
starting point. The recipe was changed to an ABC-type ALD process
by adding a step of Hacac dosing before the precursor step. The Hacac
(≥99% ReagentPlus; CAS 123-54-6) was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich, and it was employed without further puriﬁcation. The Hacac
has a vapor pressure of 6 Torr at 25°C, and it exists in two tautomeric
forms: keto and enol. In gas phase, the tautomeric equilibrium is
shifted toward the enol form,39 which was the form considered in the
DFT calculations. The Hacac inhibitor was kept at room temperature
in a stainless steel container and vapor drawn into the chamber using 3
pulses of 5 s each. All experiments were carried out at a substrate
temperature of 150°C.
Substrate Preparation Methods.A set of 14 diﬀerent materials
was investigated as starting surfaces in this study. Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2,
WOx, CoOx, MoOx, FeOx, ZnO, Pt, Pd, Ru, and SiNx samples were
prepared by ALD in our lab using standard ALD recipes. In addition,
crystalline Si and Ge substrates were used. All these substrates were
cleaned by 5 min O2 plasma exposure (8 mTorr O2, 200 W) prior to
the deposition, with the exception of SiNx. Because of this O2 plasma
cleaning step, the Si and Ge substrates are referred to as SiO2 and
GeO2, respectively, in this article.
Analytical Methods. In situ SE was performed using a J.A.
Woollam M2000D ellipsometer as the main diagnostic technique to
characterize the process and to measure the nucleation curves, using a
Cauchy parametrization to model the data. In the case of SiNx,O 2
plasma oxidation occurs during the SiO2 deposition, which was taken
into account in the modeling of the data ofFigure 2. The nucleation
delay was deﬁned as the number of cycles until theﬁrst data point that
showed a measurable increase in thickness. The dielectric function of a
monolayer of adsorbed Hacac molecules was not taken into account,
and the same Cauchy parametrization as used to describe the
deposited SiO2 was employed to model the subcycle SE data of
Figures 3 and S4. In these results, the thickness obtained from
modeling the data after Hacac exposure is therefore represented as an
“apparent thickness”.
XPS measurements were performed using a K-Alpha system from
Thermo Scientiﬁc. TOF-SIMS analysis was performed at Philips
Innovation Laboratories using an Ion-Tof TOF-SIMS IV instrument,
which was operated in positive mode to measure Al+ (m/z = 27), Si+
(m/z = 28), and Ge+ (sum of m/z = 70, 72 representing the most
abundant isotopes of Ge). In addition, TOF-SIMS mapping was
performed on patterned GeO 2/Al2O3 samples by applying burst-
alignment with long pulses of 200 ns, resulting in high lateral
resolution (∼0.3 μm), but low mass resolution (∼1 m/z). A series of
2, 5, and 10 regular ALD cycles for SiO2 deposition was performed on
Ge substrates to calibrate the TOF-SIMS signals for thickness
quantiﬁcation. These samples were probed using the high-current
bunched mode, which allows for measurement with high mass
resolution. Note that the thickness of the deposited SiO2 on the GeO2
regions is already beyond the linearity limit of TOF-SIMS, meaning
that the ratio of the Si+ intensity of the GeO2 and Al2O3 regions in the
line scans underestimates the selectivity.
In situ FTIR experiments were carried out in a home-built ALD
setup, which is very similar to the FlexAL reactor in terms of the
plasma source and pumping system. This home-built setup is equipped
with a Bruker Vector FTIR spectrometer with a mid-infrared light
source (Globar ∼10 000−50 cm−1) and a liquid N2 cooled mercury
cadmium tellurium detector with a spectral range of 12 000−550 cm−1,
a translational and rotational sample manipulator, and KBr windows
that can be isolated from the chamber with gate valves. FTIR
measurements were performed on Aerosil OX50 SiO2 powder that was
pellet-pressed on a tungsten mesh. The powder was heated to 150°C
by passing a current through the mesh. To account for the accessible
surface area of the powder, the spectra were normalized to the peak
intensities of regular saturated TMA or BDEAS adsorption on the
same sample before the Hacac dosing.
Computational Methods. All electronic structure calculations
were performed using the projector-augmented wave function40,41 as
implemented in Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP
v.5.3.5).42−44 First-principles calculations were carried out using the
generalized gradient approximation to the DFT.45,46 Perdew−Burke−
Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange−correlation functionals47 were employed,
and the van der Waals interactions were also accounted for on an
empirical basis (PBE-D3).48 Hydroxylated α-Al2O3 and α-SiO2 clusters
were used as approximations of the amorphous hydroxylated Al2O3
and SiO2 used in the experiments. Additional computational details
including the model system preparation can be found in the
