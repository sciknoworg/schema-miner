1. Introduction
Zirconium and hafnium oxide ﬁlms are char-
acterized by speciﬁc electrical, optical, and chem-
ical properties, which make them of great interest
as catalysts [1,2] and as candidates for SiO2 gate
dielectric replacement in the next generation of
ﬁeld eﬀect transistors [3,4]. Atomic layer chemical
vapor deposition (ALCVD or ALD) is one of the
mostpromisingmethodsofoxideﬁlmgrowthand
is being studied intensively [5]. In particular, this
interest is due to the capability of controlling epi-
taxial or amorphous ﬁlm growth to an atomic
layer precision.

The growth of hafnium and zirconium oxide
ﬁlms (MOx,M ¼ Hf, Zr) in an ALD reactor with
MCl4 and water as precursors, the structural
properties and chemical composition of these
ﬁlms were comprehensively studied in [6–13]. It
was shown that at low temperatures the ALD
methodproduceduniformamorphousﬁlms.How-
ever, these ﬁlms were of low density and were
highly contaminated with chlorine atoms. The
subsequent annealing, commonly used to densify
the ﬁlms and to remove contaminations, leads
to the formation of polycrystalline structures,
which often suﬀer from high leakage current den-
sities. Films grown at higher temperatures had a
lowchlorinecontamination,butevenas-deposited
ﬁlms were polycrystalline in this case. Hence, a
fundamental understanding of the chemistry and
kineticsofoxideﬁlmgrowthinanALDreactoris
ofprimaryinterestandimportanceinordertoﬁnd
the best conditions for obtaining high-quality
ﬁlms.
In the experimental works cited above a quali-
tative chemical mechanism of MOx ﬁlm growth
was suggested and discussed. The thermodynamic
characteristics of the main surface half-reactions
proposed in [6–13] were theoretically estimated in
[14,15]usingquantum-chemicaldensityfunctional
theory (DFT) calculations of relatively small
molecular clusters. Nevertheless, a quantitative
description of ﬁlm growth kinetics has not been
developed so far, in spite of the availability of
numerous experimental data on MO2 ﬁlm growth
inan ALD reactor. Moreover, as it will beshown
below, the existing interpretation of MO2 ﬁlm
growth experiments meets signiﬁcant diﬃculties.
This work is dedicated to a theoretical investi-
gationofthemechanismandkineticsofMO 2 ﬁlm

tor-scale and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simula-
tions. This paper is organized as follows. The

tionsofMO2 ﬁlmgrowtharepresentedinSection

outlined in Section 5.
2. Mechanism of MO2 ﬁlm growth in an ALD
reactor: state of the art and problems
The main experimental features of MO2 ﬁlm
growth kinetics in the ALD process can be sum-
marized as follows [6–11]:
(a) the MO2 ﬁlm growth rate (mass or thickness
increment per cycle) on hydroxylated surfaces
is much higher than on bare metal oxide sur-
faces;
(b) the maximum amount of the deposited oxide
(ﬁlm mass increment) per cycle is 30–50% of
MO2 monolayer (ML), depending on process
conditions;
(c) the average ﬁlm mass and thickness incre-
mentsperALDcycle decreasewithincreasing
temperature (more than a factor of 2 in the
temperature range 200–800/C176C);
(d) the Cl:M ratioðxÞ in the chemisorbed MClx
surfacegroupsatthesurfaceofagrowingﬁlm
varies fromx ¼ 2 (MCl2) at low temperature
(200 /C176C) tox ¼ 3–4 at high temperature (600
/C176C);
(e) the residual chlorine concentration in the ﬁlm
decreasesfrom /C245%tolessthan1%astemper-
ature increases from 200 to 600/C176C.
The following simpliﬁed empirical mechanism
wassuggestedbyKytokivi andco-workers [12,13]
for MO2 ﬁlm growth at low temperatures, when
the surface is normally hydroxylated:
MðOHÞ2=s= þ MCl4
()MO2=b= þ MCl2=s= þ 2HCl ð1Þ
MCl2=s= þ 2H2O()MðOHÞ2=s= þ 2HCl ð2Þ
Here, we use the notation for surface sites in
accordance with that generally accepted in the
68 M.Deminskyetal./SurfaceScience549(2004)67–86

literature[12].Designations/s/and/b/correspond
to the surface groups and the bulk oxide, respec-
tively. Overall reactions (1) and (2) compose one
ALD cycle. Each of them can be naturally repre-
sented as a sequence of simple reaction steps
shown schematically in Fig. 1. These reactions
lead to the formation of a stoichiometric single
(though, incomplete, see point (b) above) MO2
submonolayer (see point (b) above) on a hydrox-
ylated metal oxide surface. This scheme of com-
plexchemicalreactionsofMCl4 andH2Owiththe
surface of a growing ﬁlm is based on the results
of quantum-chemical calculations [16,17] of the
t-ZrO2(001) surface. It was shown that water
adsorption at this surface should proceed with
dissociation(adissociativelyadsorbedwatermole-
culewasfoundtobesomewhatmorestablethana
molecularly adsorbed one) to form two bibridged
hydroxyl groups in accordance with experimental
data [18–20].
To explain the decrease in the ﬁlm growth rate
(see points (a) and (c) above) and the variation of
the composition of chemisorbed MClx surface
groups (point (d)) with temperature, it was as-
sumed that the concentration of surface OH
groupsiscontrolledbythedehydroxylation(water
desorption) reaction [6]
MðOHÞ2=s= ()MO=s= þ H2O ð3Þ
drawn schematically in Fig. 2.
An increase in temperature leads to a decrease
in the number of reactive –OH surface sites
throughreaction(3).Hence,theprobabilityofthe
formation of the bridged MCl2/s/ groups in the
reaction of MCl3/s/ groups with the neighboring
hydroxyl (Fig. 1) becomes lower at higher tem-
peratures, and MCl3/s/ groups become the domi-
nating surface species after the MCl4 pulse is
introducedintheALDchamber.Thechemisorbed
MCl3/s/ groups can react with water in the same
way as MCl2/s/ in reaction (2), thus allowing the
completion of the ALD cycle [6]. Surface dehydr-
oxylation (reaction (3)) explains the decrease in
the mass increment per cycle and the increase in
the number of Cl atoms per metal in the surface
MClx/s/ groups. In [21], it was suggested that the
growth rate can also be aﬀected by the chemical
readsorbtion of HCl. Therefore this process will
also be taken into account in the kinetic scheme
developed below.
The high Cl:M ratioðx > 3Þ in MClx surface
groups observed after the MCl4 pulse at tempera-
tureshigherthan400 /C176C(point(d))wasexplained
by the dissociative chemisorption of MCl4 on the
fully dehydroxylated surface areas [6]

MClOðMCl3Þ=s= þ 2H2O

Accordingtotheexperimentaldata(seepoint(a)),
reaction (4) should result in a lower mass incre-
ment per cycle than reaction (1).

[22].
Hence, important features of the MO2 ALD
process (points (a)–(d)) can be explained by the
mechanism that combines low-temperature depo-
sition at a more reactive hydroxylated surface
(reactions (1) and (2)), surface dehydroxylation
(reaction(3))andhigh-temperaturedepositionata
less reactive dehydroxylated surface (reactions (4)
and (5)).
Although the suggested simpliﬁed mechanism
(reactions (1)–(5)) can qualitatively explain some
important features of the MO2 ALD process [6–
13], its application to the quantitative description
of ﬁlm growth kinetics meets signiﬁcant diﬃcul-
ties.First,thismechanismcannotexplaintheslow
decrease in the ﬁlm growth rate with increasing
temperatureobservedexperimentally(Fig.3).The
recombinationreactionofsurface–OHgroups(3),
whichdiminishesthesurfacedensityofactive–OH
sites, should give a sharp decrease in the mass
increment per cycleDm0 with temperature at a
constant adsorption energyEad. Indeed, the mass
increment per cycle should be proportional to the
number density of surface OH groups [OH]s,
which is described by the well-known Langmuir
equation
Dm0 /C24½OH/C138s
/C241=ð1þ K expð/C0Ead=RT ÞÞ; K /C254nsx=nv:
ð6Þ
Heren isthe water vapor number density,v isthe
average velocity of gas-phase molecules,ns is the
total number density of surface sites available for
water adsorption, and x is the characteristic
desorption frequency of water molecules. The
hydroxylation degree (b ¼½ OH/C138s=2ns) calculated
byEq.(6)asafunctionoftemperaturefortypical
values ofEad (inthe range 25–45 kcal/mol[23,24])
is given in Fig. 3. It is evident that an increase in
temperature by onlyDT /C24100 /C176C leads to about
90% surface dehydroxylation for allEad values,
indicating that virtually all of the variation in the
deposition rate with temperature should occur
within a 100/C176C temperature range. However, this
behavior is obviously in contradiction with the
available experimental data, also shown in Fig. 3,
in which the deposition rate gradually decreases
over a range of more than 400/C176C [6,10,11].
Anotherdeﬁciencyoftheexistingmechanismis
concerned with the chlorine contamination in the
ﬁlm. Because the water concentration during the
water pulse is in signiﬁcant excess with respect to
the total amount of surface sites and the chemical
readsorption of HCl is presumably low, the water
reaction with surface chlorine atoms can be accu-
ratelydescribed bytheﬁrst-orderkineticequation
d½Cl/C138=dt /C24/C0kðT Þ½Cl/C138nH2O;
½Cl/C138/C24expð/C0kðT Þ/C2nH2O /C2sÞ; ð7Þ
where kðT Þ is the eﬀective rate constant of the
water reaction with surface chlorine ands is the
duration of the water treatment. Eq. (7) is valid if
the dependence of the eﬀective rate constantkðT Þ
onthelocalenvironmentofchemisorbedClatoms
is disregardedaswas implicitlyassumedin[6–13].
According to Eq. (7), the residual chlorine
concentration should depend exponentially onT
and s. It should be noted ﬁrst that the experi-
mental dependence of the residual chlorine con-
centration on the substratetemperature(see point
(e)) is very far from the exponential form of Eq.
(7). The exponential dependence ons is also in
strong contradiction with the experimental data.

Since the steady state ﬁlm growth rate is lower
than0.5MLperALDcycle(seepoint(b)),several
ALD cycles are required to bury a chemisorbed
chlorine atom inside the growing ﬁlm (more than
three cycles to form a monolayer over a chlorine
atom). Hence, according to Eq. (7), in order that
about5%Clremaininthegrowingﬁlm(seepoint
(e)), about 37% ð0:373 /C250:05Þ of the surface
chlorineatomsadsorbedduringthepreviousmetal
precursorpulseshouldnotreactwithwaterduring
eachpulse.However,suchasigniﬁcantamountof
unreacted Cl atoms was not observed in mass
increment measurements [6].
The problems outlined above show that the
existingmechanismofHfO 2 andZrO2 ﬁlmgrowth
in an ALD reactor needs a qualitative modiﬁca-
tion. To eliminate the contradiction between the
theoretical curves obtained based on the current
understanding of the ﬁlm growth mechanism and
the experimental temperature dependence of the
ﬁlm growth rate as demonstrated in Fig. 3, we
suggestthatthewateradsorptionenergydecreases
with increasing hydroxylation degree. In this case
the hydroxylation degree and, hence, the ﬁlm
growthrate(seeEq.(6))willdecreasemuchslower
with temperature than for a constant water
adsorption energy.
Estimations of the ratio of ﬁlm growth rates at
low and high temperatures based on Eq. (6) show
that an agreement with experiment can be
achieved if the increase in the water adsorption
energythroughthetemperaturerangefrom200to
600/C176Cis /C2415kcal/mol.Thisvalueisinagreement
with thermogravimetric experiments [23,24] of
wateradsorptiononZrO2 samples.Similarresults
were obtained in quantum-chemical calculations
of water adsorption energy [25].
In order to describe the smooth dependence of
theresidualchlorineconcentrationintheas-grown
ﬁlmonthewaterpulsedurationandthesubstrate
temperature, we made an additional assumption
that the rate constants of reactions (2) and (5)
depend on the local chemical environment of the
chemisorbed chlorine atom. It is reasonable to
assumethataClatombecomesstrongerboundto
the surface as the number of the nearest neigh-
boring metal atoms increases and, hence, the
number of short M–Cl contacts also increases. In
this case, the activation energy of possible reac-
tionsbetweenwaterandchemisorbedchlorinewill
also increase. Steric hindrances from neighboring
chemisorbed surface groups will act in the same
direction. Therefore, as the ﬁlm grows, the reac-
tion of water with a chemisorbed chlorine atom
will slow down. This eﬀect results in the fact that
theresidualchlorineconcentrationisnotdescribed
by Eq. (7) and the chlorine atoms can be can be
readily captured in the growing ﬁlm. It should be
noted here that the processes of chlorine diﬀusion
should also be taken into account under real
deposition conditions.
Thus, the analysis presented above indicates
that the mechanism and kinetics of the ALD
process cannot be interpreted even qualitatively
withouttakingintoaccountstereochemicaleﬀects,
in particular, the eﬀects of surface coverage on
the reactivity of chemisorbed surface species. An
appropriate approach to the description of the
ALD process should involve atomistic concepts
andamoredetailedformulationofthemechanism
in terms of surface groups and elementary reac-
tions of key chemical steps.
At present, even approximate estimates of the
necessary rate constants for the gas-surface reac-
tionsinvolvedinZr(Hf)O2 ALDareunavailablein
the literature. Therefore, we performed ab initio
quantum-chemical and quantum-kinetic calcula-
tions to evaluate some of the most important
reaction constants.
3. Preliminary ab initio evaluation of reaction rate
parameters for the key reaction steps of MO2
deposition
A great diversity of surface reactions can pro-
ceed on the growing Zr(Hf)O2 surface, which is
covered by various chemisorbed surface groups.
These reactions include reactions of incident gas-
phase molecules (MCl4,H 2O, and HCl) with the
surface, yielding ‘‘primary’’ surface groups MCl3/
s/, MCl2/s/, and OH/s/. These groups can further
react with incident gas-phase molecules yielding
longer and more complicated surface groups like
–MCl2–OH, –O–MCl3,– M C l2–O–MCl3,– O –
MCl2–OH, –O–MCl2–O–MCl3, etc. Reactions
M.Deminskyetal./SurfaceScience549(2004)67–86 71

betweenchemisorbedsurfacegroups,assistedwith
their surface diﬀusion, lead to the formation of a
new surface layer (densiﬁcation). It is hardly pos-
sible todescribe allthese reactionsat theabinitio
level. However, a chemical consideration shows
that most of them involve interaction between an
M–ClbondofanMCl x moietyandanO–Hbond
of an H2O molecule or of an M–OH fragment.
Chemically, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence be-
tween these interactions and interactions involved
in basic reactions (1) and (2), because these inter-
actions are essentially local.
Therefore, the main goal of this section was to
use ab initio quantum-chemical calculations and
the quantum-statistical theory of chemical reac-
tionsinordertodeterminethebasicfeaturesofthe
elementary steps of the proposed overall mecha-
nism(reactions(1a),(1b),(2a),(2b),seeFig.1)and
to obtain basic estimates for their rate constants.
Because of the local character of interactions in-
volvedintheseprocesses,ontheonehand,andin
order to avoid indeterminacy associated with the
local chemical environment on the surface, on the
otherhand,weapproximatedrealsurfacereactions
with appropriate prototype gas-phase molecular
systems. Thus, steps (1a) and (1b) of reaction (1)
wereapproximatedbythemolecularreaction
MðOHÞ4 þ MCl4 ! MðOHÞ4/C1/C1/C1MCl4
! MðOHÞ3 /C0OMCl3 þ HCl;
whereas steps (2a) and (2b) of reaction (2) were
approximated by the molecular reaction
MðOHÞ2Cl2 þ H2O! MðOHÞ2Cl2 /C1/C1/C1H2O
! MClðOHÞ3 þ HCl
In general,calculations of the rate constants of
surface reactions require rather sophisticated
models. However, a comparison of the results
obtained in our work using periodic-type slab
models[25]andclustermodelsofsurfacereactions
[26] with the results obtained in [14,15] showed
thatevenrathersmallmolecularmodelsofsurface
sites qualitatively reproduce interaction energies
in chemical systems typical for ZrO2 and HfO2
deposition processes. Moreover, the use of simple
molecular models excludes the uncertainties asso-
ciatedwiththerealstructureofsurfaceactivesites
andtheirvariety.Inaddition,thisapproachavoids
complicated problems connected with the treat-
ment of vibrational degrees of freedom.
We calculated the energies and the structural
and vibrational parameters for the reagents, the
transition states, and the products of these model
gas-phase reactions. Then, we applied statistical
theorytocalculatereactionrateparametersforthe
corresponding gas-surface reactions within an ad
hoc quantum-kinetic model that takes into ac-
countthe eﬀectsofenergy exchangewith the bulk
andthefreezingofsomedegreesoffreedomatthe
surface.
Ab initio calculations were performed within
the framework of DFT with the hybrid three-
parameter Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) ex-
change-correlation functional [27,28] using the
Gaussian 98 program package [29]. The Zr, Hf,
andClatomsweredescribedusingtheHay–Wadt
pseudopotentials [30]) and LANL2DZ basis set;
for Cl atoms, the LANL2DZ basis set was aug-
mented with polarization d functions (with an
exponent of 0.75). The O and H atoms were de-
scribed with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set [31,32].
The frequencies of normal vibrations were cal-
culated for all fully optimized structures and used
toverifywhetherthestationarypointsfoundwere
true minima or ﬁrst-order saddle points. These
frequencies were also used in the subsequent
quantum-kinetic calculations of gas-surface reac-
tion rate parameters. The results of quantum-
chemical calculations for the model gas-phase
reactions are given in Table 1. Qualitative shapes
ofthecorrespondingreactionpathproﬁlesUrpðqrÞ
(qr isthereactioncoordinate)arepresentedinFig.
4. The energies of transition complexes (TCf) and
products are measured from the energy of the
corresponding isolated reagents.
The results of quantum-chemical calculations
show that the reactions under consideration pro-
ceed via stable intermediate complexes M(OH)-
OMCl3/s/ and MCl(OH) 3/s/ formed by the
gas-phase reagent (MCl4 or H2O) with the active
surfacesite(seealso[15])throughatypicaldonor–
acceptor coordination bond. These intermediate
complexes may play an important part in the
kineticsofﬁlmgrowth.Itwillbeshownbelowthat
the stabilization of these complexes at low tem-
72 M.Deminskyetal./SurfaceScience549(2004)67–86

peratures leads to the blocking of active surface
sites and, hence, to a decrease in the ﬁlm growth
rate (see Figs. 7 and 8).
The quantum-chemical calculations performed
using molecular models do not take into account
energy relaxation into the bulk. We developed a
special approach in which the total set of degrees
offreedomforalargemoleculeisdividedintotwo
sets (see, e.g. [33]). One set including the majority
of the degrees of freedom acts as a thermal bath.
The other set is directly related to the active
reacting center and includes the reaction coordi-
nate. This set includes only a relatively small
number of degrees of freedom.
We assumed that a gas-surface reaction that
proceeds through a precursor can be treated in
termsofthewell-developedstatisticaltheoryofgas-
phase bimolecular reactions proceeding through a
long-lived intermediate complex (see, e.g. [34,35]).

proceedstothermalequilibrium.Therefore,the
rateconstants ka,kd,kf andkr canbecalculated
usingtransitionstatetheory(see,e.g.[34]).The
details of these calculations are described in
AppendixA.Thecalculationsofrateconstants
were performed in the temperature range 25–
700/C176C and were further used in the kinetic
calculations described in Section 4 (reactions
(15)–(27) in Table 2).
Thus, the analysis of reactions with water and
chlorine precursors given above shows that even
the separate steps of reactions (1) and (2) cannot
be considered elementary and must be described
by a multistage mechanism that includes the for-
mation of an intermediate adsorption complex
(B+A/s/ ﬁ AB/s/). The intermediate complexes
have a signiﬁcant adsorption energy (Ead /C2415–20
kcal/mol), which becomes important at low tem-
peraturesT < 200 /C176C (see below), where the ﬁlm
growth rate can decrease signiﬁcantly because of
the stabilization of the adsorption complex.
4. Kinetic modeling of MO2 ﬁlm growth
Now we will show that the inclusion of the
qualitative concept of the dependence of reaction
parameters on the local chemical environment al-
lows us to describe the main quantitative kinetic
and mechanistic features of the ALD process. We
usedtwodiﬀerentapproachesforthesimulationof
MO2 ﬁlm growth: ALD reactor modeling in the
frameworkofformalkineticsandkMCmodeling.
The ﬁrst approach was used to model the
principal features of the ﬁlm growth rate and to
verify the kinetic parameters calculated using
quantum-chemical methods. An accurate descrip-
tionoftheprocessesofﬁlmcontaminationwithCl
impurities requires a detailed consideration of the
actual local surface structures, which cannot be
readilyimplementedusingsimplerateexpressions.
Therefore, we used the kMC approach, which al-
lows the local atomistic eﬀects to be implemented
inanaturalway,tomodelClincorporationinthe
ﬁlms.
We restricted our simulations to the tempera-
ture rangeT < 700 /C176C, which is typical for con-
ventional process conditions of zirconium and
hafnium oxide ALD.

The mechanism in Table 2 was implemented in
a non-steady-state plug-ﬂow reactor model to
simulaterealALDprocesses.Themodelassumesa
uniform distribution of gas-mixture velocities at a
given reactor cross section. Real experimental
conditions (the reactor geometry is described in
[6,8,10]) are diﬀerent from the proposed model.
Indeed,theuniformdistributionofgaseousspecies
in the reactor cross section suggests the absence
of diﬀusion and convection transport eﬀects on
the rates of surface chemical reactions. However,
because the main objective of this work is to
determine the principal features of the chemical
mechanism, the aspects of detailed ﬂow dynam-
ics can be neglected at this stage of consideration.
The goal of the simulations was to determine the
remaining adjustable parameters based on the
available experimental data. The following exper-
imentaldatawereusedtoverifythekineticscheme
and to adjust the reactor parameters: the depen-
dence of the ﬁlm growth rate on the process tem-
perature, the time dependence of the ﬁlm mass
increment during the MCl4 pulse, the ratio of the
totalﬁlmmassincrementattainedinanALDcycle
m0 tothemassincrementduringtheMCl 4 pulsem1
the Cl:M ratioðxÞ in the chemisorbed MClx sur-
face groups as a function of temperature, and the
chlorine concentration in the ﬁlm [6–11].
Calculations were carried out for the following
experimental conditions of HfO2 and ZrO2 ALD
[6,8,10]: carrier gas (N2) pressure, 250 Pa; tem-
perature range, 180–600/C176C; reactor volume, 160
cm3;substratesurfacearea,220cm 2;reactorcross
section, 10.2 cm2; substrate length, 6 cm; and
carrier gas ﬂow rate, 150 cm3/s.
In the experiments on ZrO2 ﬁlm growth [10],
the durations of the ZrCl4 pulse, the water vapor
pulse,andthepurgegaspulsefollowingtheZrCl 4
pulsewereeach2s.Thedurationofthepurgegas
(N2)pulsefollowingthewaterpulsewas5s.Inthe
HfO2 ﬁlm growth experiments [8], the duration of
the precursor (HfCl4,H 2O) pulses and the purge
gaspulseswereall2s.Theﬂowratesofprecursors
were estimated from the available data of their
vapor pressure in the eﬀusion cell: 1.8–3 cm3/s for
MCl4 and2.4–3cm 3/sforwatervapor.Thepartial
pressures of precursors in the reaction chamber
that correspond to the experimental conditions
usedin[8,10]canbeapproximatelyestimatedat2–
4 Pa for MCl4 precursors and at 4–6 Pa for H2O.
According to our discussion in Section 2, the
growth of the oxide ﬁlm at low temperatures is
fully determined by reactions on the hydroxylated
surface (reactions (15)–(27) in Table 2). The
M.Deminskyetal./SurfaceScience549(2004)67–86 75

parametersofthesereactionsareknownfromour
quantum-chemical and quantum-kinetic calcula-
tions.Therefore,theremainingprocessparameters
thatdonotrelatetothekineticschemeinTable2
can be adequately determined using the experi-
mental results for the low-temperature region
withinareducedkineticschemethatincludesonly
reactions (15)–(27). We found that the number
density of available surface metal atomsns ¼ 6/C2
1014 cm/C02 for the growing ZrO2 surface and
ns ¼ 5/C21014 cm/C02 for the growing HfO2 surface,
the MCl4 ﬂow rate is 1.8 cm3/s, and the H2O ﬂow
rate is 2.4 cm3/s.
Thevariationoftheﬁlmmassincrementduring
one ALD cycle calculated with these parameters
and the corresponding experimental data are
shown in Fig. 5. The theoretical curve describes
well the typical behavior of the chloride–water
ALD process: an increase in the ﬁlm mass due to
theadsorptionofprecursors,theﬂatportionofthe
curve during the purge pulse, a sharp decrease in
theﬁlmmassduringthewatervaporpulse,andan
additional mass decrease due to release of the ad-
sorbed water. However, the theoretical curve
somewhat deviates from experimental data in the
transition region at the end of the MCl4 pulse,
where the curve ﬂattens out. This deviation indi-
cates that the rate of the MCl4 reaction with sur-
face OH/s/ groups may also depend on the degree
of surface coverage by MClx/s/ groups, as we
suggested for water adsorption and for water
interaction with MClx/s/ groups (see Section 2).
Fig. 6 demonstrates the dependence of the ﬁlm
mass increment Dm0 on the temperature in the
ZrCl4 eﬀusion cell, which, in its turn, determines
the ZrCl4 ﬂow rate. The theoretical data were

obtained using the values of the ZrCl4 saturated
vaporpressure[37]toestimatethevariationofthe
ZrCl4 ﬂow rate with temperature. For the case of
low eﬀusion cell temperatures, where the ZrCl4
ﬂow rate is insuﬃcient to saturate the substrate
surface during the ZrCl4 pulse, Dm0 increases
rapidly with increasing eﬀusion cell temperature.
On the other hand, when the amount of ZrCl4 is
suﬃcient to saturate the surface,Dm0 depends on
the total number density of the available surface
sitesns and becomes independent of the eﬀusion
cell temperature. Hence, we can see in Fig. 6 that
the relationship betweenns and the ZrCl4 ﬂow
rate is correctly reproduced with our choice of
parameters.Thebehaviorofcurvesreﬂectsthefact
that an increase in the temperature of the ZrCl4
eﬀusion cell from 145 to 160/C176C leads to an in-
creaseintheprecursorﬂowratebyafactorof /C245.
Therefore, within this temperature range, the sys-
tem passes from the regime of precursor deﬁcit to
the saturation regime.
Theresultsoftheexperiments [6,8,10]andsim-
ulationsoftheZrO 2 andHfO2 ﬁlmgrowthratesas
functions of the process temperature are shown,
respectively, in Figs. 7 and 8. In accordance with
the proposed model, water desorption/adsorption
reactions (28) and (29), which are sensitive to the
surface coverage (see Eq. (14))determine the tem-
perature dependence of the growth rate. The best

activation energies of reactions (28) and (29) in
Table2).
Thus, mechanism (15)–(29) describes satisfac-
torilytheexperimentaltemperaturedependenceof
the growth rate and can be interpreted as a
‘‘minimum’’ mechanism in this sense. The values
of the rate coeﬃcients of all reactions of the
‘‘minimum’’ mechanism are determined from QC
calculations.Therefore,thevalidityoftheresultsis
determinedbytheaccuracyoftheQCanalysisand
by our suggestion about the reasons for the de-
crease in the growth rate with increasing temper-
ature.
However, one can see that the minimum mech-
anism suﬀers from essential drawbacks from the
viewpointsof bothits physical validity and exper-
imental veriﬁcation. First, the minimum mecha-
nism neglects surface diﬀusion processes, which
may be important in the water desorption mecha-
nism.Thisassumptionisvalidonlyathighsurface
hydroxylationdegrees.However,atlowcoverages,
dehydroxylationiscontrolledbytwoprocesses:the
diﬀusion-assisted reaction of hydroxyl groups to
form a pre-desorption complex and the decompo-
sition of this complex to desorb water. The ﬁrst
process is of the second order with respect to the
concentrationofsurfacehydroxylgroups,whereas
the second one is of the ﬁrst order. Depending on
the reaction parameters and the hydroxylation
degree,theoverallrateofsurfacedehydroxylation
canbelimitedbyeitherprocess.Itcan,initsturn,
aﬀect the overallgrowth rate in the high tempera-
ture region, where the coverage decreases with
increasing temperature. Second, the minimum
mechanismcannotexplaintheexperimentalfactof

MClx surfacegroupsfrom x ¼ 2to x ¼ 3,because
itoperateswithasingletypeofhydroxylatedsites,
namely,M(OH)2.
Because of the reasons discussed above, the
minimum scheme was extended to take into ac-
countboththechangeinthestateofchemisorbed
MClx surfacegroupsandthediﬀusionprocessesin
theframeworkoftheformalkineticapproach(see
Table 3). We introduced the following additional
groups of surface sites (see Fig. 9):
(1) sites that describe the variable degree of sur-
face hydroxylation: 50% dehydroxylated site
M(OH)O(OH)M/s/ and 75% dehydroxylated
site M(OH)OMOMO(OH)M/s/;
(2) sitesthatdescribethephysicaladsorptionofa
metal precursor on partially dehydroxylated
sites: M(OH)O(OH)MMCl4/s/, MCl4M(OH)-
O(OH)MMCl4/s/, MCl4M(OH)OMOMCl3/s/;
(3) sites that describe the chemical adsorption
of a metal precursor on hydroxylated sites:
M(OH)OMOMCl3/s/, Cl3MOMOMOMCl4/s/,
Cl3MOMOMOMCl3/s/;
(4) sites that describe the products of water
treatment: M(OH)OMOM(OH)Cl 2/s/, Cl 3-
MOMOMOM(OH)Cl2/s/, Cl 2(OH)MOMO-
MOM(OH)Cl2/s/, Cl2(OH)MOMOM(OH)/s/.
It is reasonable to assume that the area r
occupied by a surface site is proportional to the
number of metal (M) atoms in this site, e.g.,
r(M(OH)2)/r(M(OH)O(OH)M)¼ 1/2.
Reactions (30)–(34) describe dehydroxylation/
hydroxylation in the case of control by the diﬀu-
sion-assistedreactionofhydroxylgroups.Thepre-
exponential factor of the rate constant of this
reaction is of the same order of magnitude as the
Fig. 8.HfO2 ﬁlmgrowthrate(averageﬁlmmassandthickness
increments per cycle) as a function of the process temperature:
squares and circles correspond to experimental results [6,8].
Dashed and solid lines correspond to the calculated results by
the minimum and extended mechanism. Dashed area corre-
sponds to sensitivity analysis for the extended mechanism.

reaction(28),theactivationenergyofthereaction
(32) was considered coverage-depending in accor-
dance with Eq. (14).
Reactions (35)–(54) describe ﬁlm growth on
partiallydehydroxylatedsurfaces.Becausethereis
no information on the kinetic parameters of these
reactions,theseparameterswereestimatedorwere
taken by analogy with reactions (15)–(27) of the
minimum mechanism.
The results of simulations of ZrO2 and HfO2
ﬁlm growth rates based on the extended mecha-
nism are shown, respectively, in Figs. 7 and 8 in
comparison with the results of the minimum
mechanism. Since there was some arbitrariness in
choosing the rate parameters of the extended
mechanism,theseresultsarepresentedlikeareasin
theﬁgures.Theseareascorrespondtothevariation
ofthepre-exponentialfactorsofreaction(30)–(54)

obtained withE0

and 43 kcal/mol andDe ¼ 16 and 20 kcal/mol for
HfO2 and ZrO2, respectively, (solid line in Figs. 7
and8).Thesevaluesareconsistentwiththeresults
of thermogravimetric experiments [24] and ﬁrst-
principlesplane-waveDFTcalculations[25].
Note that the extended mechanism gives lower
valuesoftheadsorptionenergythantheminimum
one. As it was mentioned above, the overestima-
tion of the adsorption energy in the minimum
mechanism is due to neglecting diﬀusion con-
trolled reactions and of the ﬁlm growth processes
on the partially dehydroxylated sites.
At T > 200 /C176C, the ﬁlm growth rate essentially
decreases with increasing temperature. In the
framework of the proposed mechanism, this
behavior is determined by the decrease in the
numberdensity ofthe availableactivesites dueto
therecombinationofOH/s/surfacegroups.Inthis
case, the formation of a new layer proceeds
through precursor reactions (35)–(48) with OH/s/
groupsonapartiallydehydroxylatedsurface.This
leads to a change in the Cl:M ratioðxÞ in the
chemisorbed MClx surface groups fromx ¼ 2t o

dependence ofx on the process temperature are
shown.
In the low-temperature region T < 150 /C176C,
where experimental points are absent, the results
of our simulations (Figs. 7 and 8) predict that the
ﬁlm growth rate decreases with process tempera-
ture.It wasemphasizedabove(seeSection3)that
this behavior is explained by the stabilization of
the adsorption complex at low temperatures.
The mechanism introduced above describes the
growth of an ‘‘ideal’’ MO2 ﬁlm (no defects or
spatialnon-uniformitieswereconsidered).Thereal
ﬁlm contains residual chlorine. The concentration
of chlorine in the ﬁlm obviously relates to its
concentrationonthesurfaceduringdeposition.In

tion after a water pulse was found to be a very
sensitive function of the process temperature and
the water pulse duration, which, as was discussed
above (see Section 2, Eq. (7)) is in contradiction
with the experimental data [10]. According to this
discussion, this discrepancy can be removed by
taking into account the dependence of the chemi-
cal activity of surface chlorine on its chemical
environment and chlorine diﬀusion processes,
which in principle is outside the scope of formal
kinetic modeling. To take into account these ef-
fects, we applied the kMC approach.
4.2. Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling of ZrO2 ﬁlm
growth
Weusedalattice kMCmodeltoexplicitly take
into account the following eﬀects of the inhomo-
geneous local chemical environment on the ﬁlm
growth kinetics:
(1) dependenceofthewateradsorptionenergyon
the surface hydroxylation degree;
(2) eﬀect of steric repulsion between neighboring
MClx/s/ surface groups;
(3) dependence of the activation energy of the
hydrolysis of M–Cl bonds on the chemical
environment of the chlorine atom.
Like in the formal kinetic scheme above, the
ﬁrst eﬀect allows us to describe the temperature
dependence of the surface hydroxylation degree
and,hence,thetemperaturedependenceoftheﬁlm
growth rate. The second eﬀect restricts the maxi-
mumcoverageofthemetaloxidesurfacebymetal
precursors and, hence, determines the highest
possible ﬁlm growth rate. The third eﬀect is
responsible for the enhanced incorporation of
chlorineatomsinthegrowingﬁlmandisusedhere
to explain the experimental temperature depen-
denceoftheresidualchlorineconcentrationinthe
as-deposited ﬁlm.
Thedescriptionofﬁlmgrowthwithinthelattice
kMC approach requires detailed information
about the structure of the growing ﬁlm. The
structure of ZrO2 ﬁlms deposited by the ALD
process under consideration was investigated in
[10].ItwasfoundthatmetastabletetragonalZrO2
with the preferred (001) orientation is the main
crystalline phase in thin ﬁlms 10–50 nm thick
deposited at 200–400/C176C. Therefore, we used the
t-ZrO2 crystal lattice as a rigid grid of adsorption
sites for zirconia ﬁlm growth in the lattice kMC
model and studied ﬁlm growth along the [001]
direction.
Inthislatticethedepositedzirconiaatomsfrom
metal precursors occupy their inherent cation

positions in the crystal lattice. In accordance with
experiment [20,39,40] and quantum-chemical cal-
culations [16,17], the adsorption of water mole-
cules on the t-ZrO2(001) surface results in the
formation of two bibridged hydroxyl groups
whose oxygen atoms are located close to the oxy-
gen anion sublattice sites previously unoccupied
in the crystal lattice. Therefore, in our lattice
kMC model, we assumed that the adsorbed oxy-
gen atoms occupy the available anion sites on
the surface of tetragonal zirconia. The hydro-
gen atoms were not considered explicitly, and the
chemisorbed hydroxyl groups were considered as
single entities. It was also assumed that chlorine
atoms occupy oxygen positions in the crystal lat-
tice (substitutional chlorine impurity). This sug-
gestion is based on the fact that the Zr–Cl bond
lengthinthe ZrCl4 precursorsrZr–Cl /C252:35/C23AA falls
well within the range 2.05–2.45/C23AA of the Zr–O
bond distances in bulk t-zirconia.
The set of chemical reactions used in the kMC
model includes the chemical adsorption of the
ZrCl4 molecule on one, two, and three surface
hydroxyl groups (similar to Fig. 1). The eﬀect of
the inhomogeneous chemical environment was
modeled using the following two rules:
(a) a cation lattice site is unavailable for the
adsorption of a ZrClx group if at least one of
the neighboring anion lattice sites is already
occupied by a chlorine atom;
(b) a chlorine atom in the ﬁlm must have at least
one Zr vacancy in its nearest neighborhood,
because the chlorine ionic radiusrionðClÞ/C25

dius rionðOÞ/C251:2 /C23AA.
Rule(a)statesthatanadsorbedZrCl x (x ¼ 1–3)
group prevents the chemisorption of ZrCl4 with
the formation of ZrClx groups on the nearest
neighboringsites.Thisruleresultsinthemaximum
surface coverage by ZrClx groups of 50% for the
regular structure on the planar fully hydroxylated
surface (staggered adsorption) and about 35%
coverage for random adsorption on the surface.
Thefulﬁllmentofrule(b)leadstotheformationof
zirconium vacancies in the growing zirconia ﬁlm
together with residual chorine impurities.
The hydrolysis of Zr–Cl bonds and the reac-
tions of adsorbed ZrClx groups with neighboring
surface hydroxyl groups (ZrCl x/s/+OH/s/ ﬁ
OZrClx/C01/s/+HCl) are considered irreversible,
because the resulting HCl molecules are rapidly
carriedoutfromthereactorvolumewiththeinert-
gas ﬂow. It was also assumed that chlorine atoms
can also be removed from the ﬁlm bulk if there
exists a continuous free diﬀusion path connecting
the given chlorine atom to the surface through
oxygenvacancies.Here,whendeterminingthefree
diﬀusion path, we consider that, in accordance
withrule(b),achlorineatomcanoccupyananion
sublattice site only if there is at least one cation
vacancy in its coordination shell.
The dissociative adsorption of water proceeds
on a surface M–O pair with the formation of two
neighboring OH groups on the surface. It was
assumed that the energy of the reversible disso-
ciative adsorption of water depends on the chem-
ical environment of the corresponding surface
lattice sites

where NOH is the total number of the neighboring

This relationship plays the same role in the kMC
scheme as Eq. (14) in the formal kinetic scheme.
The chemical reactions discussed above are
suﬃcient in the case of an ideal ﬁlm. However, in
thecaseofrealﬁlmswithimpuritiesandstructural
defects (e.g., lattice vacancies), it is necessary
to supplement the set of chemical reactions with
the physical processes of diﬀusion and relaxation
(healing of defects). Therefore, we added surface
and bulk diﬀusion processes for zirconium, chlo-
rine, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms; hydroxyl
groups; and ZrOHyClx/s/ surface species (here,
only surface diﬀusion). Within the rigid lattice
model,thediﬀusionofatomsandgroupsproceeds
only through vacant lattice sites (note the above
deﬁnition of the free diﬀusion path for chlorine
atoms based on rule (b)). The diﬀusion of hydro-
gen atoms proceeds via jumps from one oxygen
atom to another. The mobility of a zirconium
groupbearingachlorineatomwasalsolimitedby
rule (b). Unfortunately, information available in
the literature on the diﬀusion coeﬃcients in zir-
82 M.Deminskyetal./SurfaceScience549(2004)67–86

conia ﬁlms is very scarce. However, under real
experimental conditions (gas pressure and process
temperature)theprocessesofdiﬀusionovervacant
lattice sites must be much faster than all gas-sur-
face chemical reactions. In our kMC simulations,
thisfactwastakenintoaccountbysettingtherates

In the computational procedure, the kMC sol-
ver chooses one chemical reaction at each instant

whereri

intermediate surface complexes were not consid-
ered in the lattice kMC scheme, the reaction rates
werecalculatedbasedonthedatainTable2within
the quasi-equilibrium approach, in which it is as-
sumed that an equilibrium exists between gas re-
agents and intermediate surface complexes. The
timestepofkMCintegrationisdeterminedbythe
sums inthedenominator,and,thus, oneandonly
one chemical reaction is treated at each time step.
In this way, we generated about 30000 chemical
events for each pulse of anALD cycle. The initial
substrate contained(5· 5) cells oft-ZrO2 oriented
along the [001] direction.
First,weinvestigatedthemaximumcoverageof
thefullyhydroxylatedzirconiasurfacewithZrCl 4.
The calculated coverage of the fully hydroxylated
(001) surface of t-ZrO2 averaged over a set of
simulations is about 35%. In ﬁlm growth simula-
tions, it has been found that the growing ﬁlm
thickness is proportional to the number of ALD
cycles,andthemaximumﬁlmgrowthrateisabout
0.4MLperALDcycle.Thisvalueisinreasonable
agreement with experimental results reported in
[22](about0.4MLperALDcycle)and[7](about
0.6 ML per ALD cycle). Moreover, the tempera-
ture dependence of the ﬁlm growth rate is similar
tothatinFig.7obtainedwithintheformalkinetic
approach: there is a maximum of the ﬁlm growth
rate at low temperatures (/C24200 /C176C) and a slow
decrease in the ﬁlm growth rate at higher temper-
atures.Here,thebestﬁtwasobtainedforE0

areinadequateagreementwiththecorresponding
values obtained in the formal kinetic simulations.
Indeed, with regard to the normalization ofDEad
to one OH group in kMC and to one surface site
in formal kinetics,De ¼ DEadN ¼ 14:4 kcal/mol,
whereN ¼ 6isthenumberoftheneighboringOH/
s/ groups per one dissociatively adsorbed water
molecule.
Next, we investigated the dependence of the
chlorine atom concentration in the growing ﬁlm
on the process conditions. To take into account
the eﬀect of the local chemical environment of a
surfacechlorineatomonitsprobabilityofreacting
with a water molecule, we used the following
dependence of the activation energy of this reac-
tion on the number of the nearest neighboring Zr
atoms in the chlorine coordination shell:
Ea ¼ E0
a /C0DEa /C1NZr; ð57Þ
where NZr is the number of zirconium neighbors.
Taking into account this dependence for the
reaction probability, we calculated the residual
chlorineconcentrationintheas-depositedzirconia
ﬁlm (see Fig. 11). The results in Fig. 10 were ob-
tainedwithE0
a ¼ 2:5kcal/mol andDEa ¼ 1:2kcal/

mental data. Thus the relatively weak dependence
of the activation energy on the chemical environ-
mentofthechlorineatomcanexplainthechlorine
concentration observed experimentally in the as-
deposited ﬁlm.
5. General conclusions and outlook
An extended kinetic mechanism of the ALD
growth of Zr(Hf)O2 ﬁlms from Zr(Hf)Cl4 and
water has been developed. This mechanism takes
into account the formation of relatively stable
intermediate surface complexes, the eﬀects of the
local chemical environment on the reaction rate
parameters,possiblesurfacereactions(inaddition
to gas-surface reactions), and diﬀusion. This
mechanism has been implemented using a formal
kinetic approach and the kMC method. The rate
parameters for the basic chemical reactions have
been evaluated using ab initio quantum-chemical
calculations and microscopic kinetic theory.
The results of simulations based on the mech-
anism developed in this work quantitatively de-
scribe the main experimental features of the ﬁlm
growth process. In particular, both the formal
kinetic and kMC approaches correctly describe
the experimental temperature dependence of the
growth rate, which decreases slowly over the
temperature range 200 /C176C< T < 600 /C176C. This
slow decrease in the growth rate is explained
within our mechanism on the assumption that the
water desorption energy increases with increasing
degree of surface dehydroxylation.
It is also shown that the kMC approach based
on the detailed chemical mechanism developed in
thisworknotonlyreproducesthekineticbehavior
but also adequately describes the accumulation of
chlorine atoms in the growing ﬁlm. The main
problem in this case is that the incorporation of
impurity chlorine atoms in the growing ﬁlm is
mainly determined by their interactions with
neighboring metal atoms. In order to describe
these interactions correctly, an atomistic model of
the growing ﬁlm capable of describing the local
environment of each chlorine atom becomes nec-
essary.
The results of this work indicate that an inte-
grated multilevel approach to kinetic modeling,
which combines ﬁrst-principle modeling at the
atomistic and mesoscale levels with macro-kinetic
modelingatthereactor-scale,canprovidevaluable
insights into the understanding of complicated
processes like ALD.

Appendix A. Calculation of rate constants of ele-
mentary gas-surface reactions
Two diﬀerent situations arise in the calculation
of rate constants of reactions (12) and (13). The
ﬁrst situation corresponds tothe reactions oftype
(13)withthereactionpathproﬁleshowninFig.4a
(right-hand side of the potential curve). These
reactions are characterized by a pronounced po-
tential barrier. Therefore, quantum-chemical cal-
culationsprovideallthenecessaryinformation on
the energy,Ef of the corresponding transition
complexanditsstructure,andstandardtransition
state theory can be used to calculatekf and kr for
these reactions. For all the reactions under con-
sideration, our quantum-chemical calculations
predict that the fragment H–Cl of the transition
complex TCf is structurally similar to the product
gasmolecule.Therefore,byanalogywiththeloose
transitioncomplexTCad (whichwillbeconsidered
below),itwasassumedthattheescapingfragment
H–Cl performs two surface-restricted rotations in
addition to vibrations, whose frequencies were
determined in the model from quantum-chemical
calculations.
For all other reactions, the potential barrier is
absent and there is no a priori prescription for
84 M.Deminskyetal./SurfaceScience549(2004)67–86

determining the structure of the corresponding
loose transition complex and its location in the
reaction path. To ﬁnd the structure of the transi-
tioncomplexandtocalculatetherateconstantsin
this case, we used the interpolation version of the
variational transition state theory developed in
[41].
For deﬁniteness consider reaction (12). In the
variational transition state theory, the positionq#

(see Fig. 4) corresponds to a maximum of the
