Abstract: Area-selective atomic layer deposition (ASALD) as a bottom-up nanopatterning technique
has gained recognition for its ability to address misalignment issues in semiconductor manufacturing.
This in silico study investigates process operation conditions for ASALD of SiO2/Al2O3 and reactor
optimization by using multiscale computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Several reactor
designs were modeled in Ansys Workbench and their results compared to ensure effective reagent
separation and homogeneous exposure to reagents across the wafer. Annular reaction zones and
asymmetrical inlets enhanced uniform exposure to reagents and minimized reagent intermixing,
which allowed the reactor to tolerate higher rotational speeds. Additionally, low rotation speeds and
high species mole fractions were required for complete deposition of a cycle of the ASALD process.
This research provides insight into the ASALD process operation and contributes to further industrial
versatility.

1. Introduction
The last decade has seen a rise in the performance and downscaling of technology due
to the successful commercialization of 5-nm Fin-Field Effect Transistors (FinFETs), which is
attributed to the newly developed, state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography
technology [1]. The semiconductor industry is now presumably on the verge of entering
the 3-nm process era [ 2,3], thereby meeting the projections of Moore’s Law. To further
miniaturize and improve nanochip performance, the stacking of transistors to assemble
elaborate three-dimensional (3D) structures is being implemented in nanodevices [4], and
the number of levels of stack is increasing signiﬁcantly [ 5]. However, chipmakers are
facing a challenge where vertically stacked features are often displaced from their original
positions as the feature sizes of electronic devices continue to shrink [ 6]. To maximize
chip performance, device features on 3D structures must be positioned with extreme
precision in the nanoscale, which poses an obstacle for transistor assemblage. If devices
are not aligned properly and features are not placed in precise locations, it may lead to
a misalignment or an edge placement error (EPE) [ 7]. The misalignment of features in
3D semiconductor chip stacks needs to be resolved, as this issue also causes structures
to be deformed [8,9]. Structure deformation disrupts the ﬂow of electric currents, further
increasing the likelihood of chip failure [10]. It has been reported that these misalignment
issues are associated with the conventional top-down fabrication methodology of using
a series of deposition, lithography, and etching processes [11]. The top-down process is
Coatings 2023, 13, 558. https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings13030558 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/coatings

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 2 of 26
deﬁned as the one that carves out large structures in the substrate to build a feature in a
subtractive fashion. This top-down paradigm has deﬁnitely contributed to the existence of
the modern 3D FinFET device. However, it has also limited the number of layers that can
be vertically stacked due to the stacking displacement.
As a compelling alternative that avoids the issue of misalignment, the bottom-up fab-
rication technique has gained momentum in recent years [12]. In this bottom-up synthesis
method, molecules are scaled up to build nanoscale features from reactive precursors in
a self-aligned manner that requires energetically favorable operating conditions [13] and
low surface defect densities [14] to yield anisotropic layering. However, the generation of
self-aligned structures allows for greater control over the morphologies of the patterned
surface and reduces EPEs while enabling smaller feature sizes for wafers [15]. Currently,
self-assembled nanostructures are constructed using lithographic techniques [16] to gen-
erate templates preceding thin-layer deposition to promote nanopatterning [ 17] in this
bottom-up approach. Recently, researchers have focused on self-assembling nanostructures
such as [18] who studied the chemoselective nature of a chemical inhibitor on chemically
similar metal-oxides and [19] who proposed a new precursor passivation technique that
was beneﬁcial for promoting higher controllable surface morphologies. In particular, a
nanowire, as a high aspect-ratio component of a transistor [20,21] that is capable of being
synthesized in one-dimensional (1D) structures [11], has been recognized for its potential to
fabricate gate-all-around (GAA) transistors [22]. Apart from self-assembly, the bottom-up
process is leveraged by a nonlithographic technique proposed in [23] and demonstrated
in [24]. This emerging technology is conducive toward reducing manufacturing costs [25],
eliminating lithography-related processes, and therefore, minimizing toxic reagents [26]
that are used in nanoimprint lithographic methods [27]. Area-selective atomic layer deposi-
tion (ASALD) is a promising candidate as a bottom-up fabrication process that addresses
the challenges of limiting multilayer stacking [ 26]. ASALD is a technique that locally
deposits materials on the growth area (GA), enabling self-aligned fabrication by reducing
EPEs [28,29]. To achieve area-selective atomic layer deposition, it is essential to protect the
top surface of the non-growth area (NGA) with surface modifying reagents or inhibitors.
In this manner, inhibitors passivate the surface of the NGA by creating protective layers
to hinder ALD growth on the NGA. Thus, ALD growth is permitted only on the GA in
chemoselective and regioselective behaviors. Inhibitor selection obviously plays an essen-
tial role to accomplish successful area-selective ALD, and several, long, aqueous polymeric
chain inhibitors have been experimented, such as octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) [28,30]
and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [ 31]. Additionally, gaseous small molecule in-
hibitors (SMIs) have been explored as a promising method [ 9,32] since the degradation
of protective coatings is insigniﬁcant, and SMI-based ASALD is readily integrated with
various vapor-phase ALD reactions [33].
However, it has been demanding to further commercialize and optimize ASALD
technology due to the difﬁculty of gaining an in-depth understanding of the process [29].
Even though experimental approaches are of value, not only are those experiments costly
and time-consuming, but in situ monitoring is also restricted, resulting in a lack of spa-
tiotemporal data. in silico studies using multiscale modeling addresses these issues by
simultaneously analyzing the features of surface kinetics and ﬂuid ﬂow throughout reactors
in a cost-effective manner. Therefore, in conjunction with experimental methods, the devel-
opment of multiphysics models is needed to offer high-ﬁdelity ﬂuid dynamics data and
robust guidelines for process operation and control. The study of multiscale modeling is
separated into three parts: (1) atomistic-mesoscopic modeling that characterizes the surface
reaction mechanism using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations and ab initio Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, (2) computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) modeling
that produces diverse data sets for multiphysics ﬂuid ﬂow, and (3) the design of optimal
control systems that ensures high-quality output and stable operation. The ﬁrst step of
developing an atomistic-mesoscopic model to delineate thin-ﬁlm surface kinetics with steric
repulsion effects for area-selective ALD of SiO2/Al2O3 in which the SMI, acetylacetone

(Hacac), precursor, bis(diethylamino)silane (BDEAS), and oxidant, ozone, are utilized for
Steps A through C, respectively, was successfully carried out [ 34]. In this paper, as the
second step, a multiscale model which combines the atomistic-mesoscopic model and a
macroscopic model is developed to offer insight for further industrialization.
Recently, there has been growing interest in spatial atomic layer deposition, which is a
potential substitute for conventional ALD processes in that it is capable of high-volume
manufacturing [35]. This high throughput capability is made possible by the injection of
reagents into separate reaction zones within the spatial reactor that are isolated with an
inert gas curtain and vacuum zones. Figure 1 depicts the schematic diagram of a sheet-
to-sheet spatial ALD reactor conﬁguration where the substrate is transferred between
reaction zones that are isolated by inert gases (gas curtain) by a conveyor belt. Due to
the spatially separated reaction zones, no lengthy purging steps are required to maintain
the self-limiting nature of the reactions. In other words, spatial ALD is able to save a
signiﬁcant amount of purging time, resulting in a high throughput ALD process. There
have been various proposals of different spatial ALD reactor conﬁgurations. The original
concept of a spatial reactor as a roll-to-roll reactor was ﬁrst proposed in 1977 [36], of which
applications were limited to ﬂexible substrates. Afterward, a few sheet-to-sheet designs for
solar photovoltaic technology and other applications have been developed and commer-
cialized [37,38]. Recent in silico research into multiphysics simulations have focused on
sheet-to-sheet designs to provide valuable insight into a route for further industrialization.
For instance, several works have explored the effects of the gap distance, which is the
separation distance between the dividers and surface of the substrate in Figure 1, on the
ﬂow dynamics [39] as well as reactor operating conditions including pumping pressure and
substrate velocity [40,41]. Furthermore, ref [42] examined how precursor ﬂow rates and
other process operating parameters impact on transport phenomena and surface reactions.
Additionally, prior works [43,44] investigated the effect of the substrate velocity on ﬁlm
uniformity and surface kinetics using a three-dimensional multiscale computational ﬂuid
dynamics model. Despite the potential of high-volume production, the sheet-to-sheet
reactors weaken in terms of versatile applications since it is impossible to avoid neces-
sitating larger equipment with longer substrates compared to standardized wafers. As
another approach, rotary designs have been experimented on a laboratory scale, and they
have demonstrated the operational capability to provide uniform ﬁlm growths [ 45,46].
Furthermore, the dimensions of rotary designs are comparable to that of stationary ALD
reactors. Nevertheless, a few studies have carried out experiments to evaluate the rotary
design [46,47]. Moreover, aforementioned in silico studies have solitarily focused on the
sheet-to-sheet type reactors, which are signiﬁcantly different from rotary type reactors in
many aspects including transport phenomena, reactor conﬁguration optimization, and
control strategies. At this stage, research studies aided by computational ﬂuid dynamics
simulations are needed to thoroughly investigate the surface kinetics in conjunction with
the ﬂuid dynamics of rotary designs.
Therefore, in this study, a computational simulation method, the so-called multiscale
model, is presented to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the features of a rotary
spatial ALD reactor design and the ABC-type ASALD process in an operable ALD window.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2.1 describes the methodology of integrating
an atomistic-mesoscopic model and a macroscopic model, Section 2.2 illustrates atomistic-
mesoscopic modeling with kinetic descriptions, Section 2.3 explains the methodology of
macroscopic modeling, Section 3 discusses the results of the multiscale modeling work,
and ﬁnally, Section 4 encapsulates the conclusion of this work.

2. Multiscale Modeling
2.1. Multiscale Modeling Framework
It is desired to establish a quantitative relationship between the mesoscale surface
kinetics on the substrate surface and the macroscopic ﬂuid dynamics of the reactor to
provide an effective and reproducible method for accurately simulating the overall process
through a multiscale modeling framework [48]. Additionally, multiscale models are capable
of modeling through various time and length scales, as illustrated in Figure 2. In this work,
a multiscale model is developed by integrating an atomistic-mesoscopic and a macroscopic
simulation that are conjoined by a data-sharing programming methodology. This new
model operates without requiring robust computational resources through appropriate pro-
cess assumptions and simpliﬁcations, and provides an accurate representation of realistic
phenomena encountered in industrial settings that have been incorporated into this work.
The atomistic-mesoscopic model of the ABC-type ASALD of SiO 2/Al2O3 surfaces
with a SMI was ﬁrst developed by [34], and it will be integrated into the multiscale model
of this work. For the purposes of this work, the atomistic-mesoscopic model will be referred
to as the mesoscopic model for simplicity. The mesoscopic model conjoins ﬁrst principles
ab initio quantum mechanics (e.g., Density Functional Theory and Nudged Elastic Band)
and statistical mechanics (e.g., Transition State Theory and Collision Theory) to evaluate
reaction rate constants that will be integrated into a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to
monitor the surface kinetics. While the mesoscopic simulation records the evolution of
surface kinetics, a macroscopic model is needed to examine the continuum mechanics in
the ambient ﬂuid conditions. A three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD)
simulation is employed to observe the spatiotemporal behavior of the species and ﬂuid
dynamics in a reaction chamber through a rigorous process of reactor optimization, mesh
discretization, and tailoring the macroscopic model to the ASALD reactor (e.g., boundary
conditions, user-deﬁned functions, numerical solver methods, and operating conditions).
From the development of the mesoscopic and macroscopic domains, the simulations are
conjoined by linking the surface partial pressure data evaluated from the macroscopic
CFD model to the kMC simulation, which successively evaluates the source accumulation
rates of species for a time progression to be deﬁned to the macroscopic CFD model. Thus,
a multiscale model is intimately constructed that enables the simultaneous modeling of
surface kinetics and continuum mechanics in a spatiotemporal manner, which is depicted
by the process diagram in Figure 3.

2.2. Mesoscopic Model
2.2.1. Surface kinetics
The abundance of undetermined reaction pathways present a challenge for deﬁning
the overall reaction mechanism for each step in the ASALD process. One methodology is to
simplify the reaction mechanism to purely consist of rate determining reactions that are also
elementary. Thus, the surface chemistries involved in ASALD of SiO2/Al2O3 are selected
from experimental works [9,50]. Below, the proposed reaction pathways for each step in
the ABC-ASALD process are summarized. There are three reactions that the mesoscopic
model must simulate that together make up one ASALD cycle. The ﬁrst reaction, Step A, is
where acetylacetone (Hacac) adsorbs to Al2O3 to act as an inhibitor on the non growth area.
This reaction has the following steps:

In Step A-1, an acidic, keto-enol tautomerized Hacac molecule reacts with the basic
hydroxyl group on the Al2O3 surface, which produces water vapor as a byproduct. Then,
in the following step, the monodentate structure of the adsorbed Hacac undergoes a
rearrangement mechanism to produce a more stable, chelate form.
The second reaction, Step B, is composed of an adsorption step of bis(diethylamino)silane
(BDEAS) onto SiO2 to propagate the growth of a monolayer of SiO2, which is referred to as
the growth area. Analogously to Step A, this reaction also consists of two steps:

In Step B-1, the bulky BDEAS molecule adsorbs to one hydroxyl site on SiO2, which
produces one molecule of diethylamine (DEA) as a byproduct. In Step B-2, the BDEAS
molecule binds to an adjacent hydroxyl site on SiO 2, which produces a second DEA
molecule as a byproduct. After Step B is completed, a monolayer of silicon atoms will have
been deposited on the original SiO2 surface.
Finally, the third reaction, Step C, is where the monolayer of Si is oxidized with O3 to
ﬁnish growing the layer of SiO2. Its reactions have the following form:
Si

Here, two ozone atoms are consumed per Si atom, leading to a homogeneous array
of geminal hydroxylated ligands of SiO 2 with two O2 atoms as the byproduct. For the
kMC algorithm, the kinetic rate constants of all reactions (above) including physisorption
and desorption of the reagents must be evaluated as a function of temperature and partial
pressures. Detailed descriptions of the reaction pathways and kinetic parameters can be
found in [34].
2.2.2. Quantiﬁcation of Surface Reactions
Various ab initio quantum and statistical mechanics as well as ﬁrst-principles physical
chemistry approaches were integrated into this work to evaluate the reaction rate constants
for each reaction. This section discusses the theoretical approaches for computing the reac-
tion rate constants for each reaction, which are categorized into two classes: nonadsorption
or adsorption.
For nonadsorption reactions, their reaction rate constants are calculated using the
Arrhenius equation, which requires the activation energy and pre-exponential terms to
be computed. The ﬁrst step towards the computing of these reaction rate constants is to
generate an optimized crystalline and molecular structure of the reactants and products of
the nonadsorption reactions. One underlying assumption of these optimized molecular

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 8 of 26
and crystalline structures is that the surface of the wafer, which is amorphous in nature,
is simpliﬁed to a homogeneous crystalline structure [ 51,52] and is modeled without the
presence of crystallographic defects. This procedure has been conducted in prior micro-
scopic and mesoscopic modeling of atomic layer etching and area-selective atomic layer
deposition processes to alleviate the computational burden of the simulation and to reduce
the complexity of the coding architecture for the kMC simulation while maintaining some
structural ﬁdelity [34,49]. The computations for structural optimization are achieved by
employing the open-source molecular dynamics program, Quantum ESPRESSO [53], to
perform a structural optimization of the lattice structure of the solid materials and the
molecular structure of the gaseous species. This procedure is conducted by ﬁnding the
minimum, total electronic energy of the species, Etotal, through tuning the independent
parameters k, Eψ, and Eρ, which are the k-points (speciﬁed as automatic), the kinetic energy
cut-off for wave functions (ecutwfc), and the kinetic energy cut-off for charge density and
potential (ecutrho), respectively, in an iterative procedure until a convergence threshold
speciﬁed to the program is satisﬁed. The parameters k, Eψ, and Eρ, are adjusted until the
inﬁmum of the total electronic energy is obtained, which is described below:
inf
k∈R6,Eψ∈R,Eρ∈R
Etotal
(
k, Eψ, Eρ
)
(1)
Following the molecular optimization procedure, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method is
employed to evaluate the activation energies for the nonadsorption reactions. The NEB
approach is a transition-path sampling procedure that identiﬁes saddle points to determine
the minimum energy path between the reactant(s) and product(s) by generating a user-
deﬁned number of images of the conversion and atomic movement for each molecular
structure [54]. Although a higher number of images (intermediate transition states with
minimum energy path) is essential for computing molecular properties of high ﬁdelity,
such a simulation will require greater computational resources to complete in ample time
as well; therefore, a total of nine images were used in a prior work [34] with results that
were veriﬁed to experimentally recorded data results observed by [9,33,50]. Once all the
intermediate images are produced along with the saddle point, the maximum energy peak is
determined, which is utilized to compute the activation energy for the forward and reverse
reactions. With the activation energy, the reaction rate constant for each nonadsorption
reaction is calculated with the Arrhenius equation, which is shown below:
knonad = ν exp
(
−Eact
RT
)
(2)
where knonad is the reaction rate constant for a nonadsorption reaction, ν is the temperature
dependent pre-exponential factor, Eact is the activation energy of the reaction, R is the
universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the reaction. The calculation of
the pre-exponential factor is simpliﬁed by assuming that the ratio between the transition
state and reactant partition functions is unity [55]. This yields the following equation for
the pre-exponential factor ν, which is dependent on the temperature, T, of the reaction:
ν = kBT
h (3)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and h is the Planck constant.
For adsorption reactions, it is simpler to calculate their reaction rate constants, which
are modeled as bimolecular reactions that follow Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and Colli-
sion Theory. The reaction rate constants for adsorbate species, s, are then characterized by
the following equation:
kads,s = Ps Asite σs
Zs
√2πmskBT (4)

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 9 of 26
where kads,s is the reaction rate constant for an adsorption reaction, Ps is the partial pressure
of the gaseous reagent, s, Asite is the surface area of a single active site, σs is an experimen-
tally determined sticking coefﬁcient unique to the reagent s, Zs is the coordination number
of the gas s, ms is the atomic mass of the gaseous reagent s, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
and T is the absolute temperature of the ambient environment. The sticking coefﬁcient was
found for Hacac to be 1.0 ×10−4 [56], that of BDEAS to be 2.0 ×10−5 [57], and that of O3 to
be 4.5 ×10−5 [58]. In [34], these sticking coefﬁcients were validated through comparison to
experimental results from [33].
2.2.3. kMC Algorithm
After characterizing the various reaction parameters through ab initio quantum and
statistical mechanics simulations as described above, the computationally efﬁcient kinetic
Monte Carlo (kMC) algorithm is integrated into the mesoscopic model simulation. The kMC
algorithm is an approach that uses randomly generated numbers to reﬂect the stochastic
and chaotic behavior of reactions occurring on the atomic scale [59]. This practice is used to
model the adsorption and interchanging of various species on the surface of the substrate
in this study. The procedure involves the weighting of potential reactions occurring on
active sites using a random number, which are discretized into a 300 ×300 array in the
Python programming language, resulting in 90,000 reaction sites in total. Following the
random selection of the reaction using the ﬁrst random number, the duration of the reaction
progression is then evaluated through a secondary random number that is independent of
the ﬁrst random number. A summary of the procedures from [55] are described below and
illustrated in Figure 4:

The kMC method establishes a stochastic procedure by randomly assigning a number,
γ1 ∈(0, 1] to select one of the reaction rate constants that were weighted during the prior
summation procedure [59]. Larger reaction rates will have a higher probability for selection
due to the weighting procedure, which is also consistent with the nature of kinetics in
favoring reaction processes with higher reaction rate constants or lower activation energies.

Although the kMC algorithm provides an efﬁcient procedure for predicting the oc-
currence of a reaction, it alone is not enough to provide an accurate description of the
overall kinetics. While activation energy barriers ultimately dictate the directionality of
reactions, other factors such as steric hindrance affect the probability of a successful adsorp-
tion reaction. The steric hindrance originates from the bulkiness of the Hacac and BDEAS
molecules in Steps A and B as the molecules must adsorb to multiple active sites to fully
adhere to the SiO2/Al2O3 surface. When these two molecules adsorb to an active site on
their respective substrates, the adsorbates are bulky that they inhibit adjacent active sites
from properly binding to other molecules, thereby generating atomic vacancies. Thus, the
kMC algorithm must be modiﬁed to account for these physical limitations by exercising
a novel methodology that simulates hindered sites. In a prior study, ref [ 34] performed
this modiﬁcation to the kMC algorithm by modeling the adsorption of individual Hacac
and BDEAS molecules by considering their orientations on the site of adsorption, which is
integrated into the multiscale modeling framework in this work.
The kinetic model described above was validated by comparing the in silico simulation re-
sults of Hacac adsorption on Al2O3 to reported experimental results of the same reaction. The
kinetic model simulated a chelate surface density of 1.45±0.02 molecules/nm2 [34] while ex-
perimental results determined a chelate surface density of 1.7±0.1 molecules/nm2 [33]. This
deviation is attributed to the longer atomic distances calculated with Quantum ESPRESSO
compared to the shorter atomic distances observed by [ 33]. Additionally, the ratio of
Hacac chelate to monodentates is also comparable with experimental ﬁndings. The kinetic
model simulation computed a monodentate fraction of 19.37 ±1.40% [34] while the experi-
mental value of monodentate fraction was found to be 20 ±5% [33] through infrared (IR)
spectroscopy. Furthermore, the computed process time to achieve full coverage for the
mesoscopic simulation was determined to be similar to results conducted in experimental
laboratory settings [34]; thus, the kMC algorithm is incorporated into the multiscale model
with conﬁdence.
2.3. Macroscopic Model
2.3.1. Macroscopic Modeling Logistics
The macroscopic model consists of preprocessing and postprocessing procedures that
are intended to simulate ﬂuid dynamics for the ASALD process. First, reactor conﬁgurations
are assembled through computer aided design (CAD) software. The conﬁgurations are
optimized computationally through a mesh of reasonable quality which ensures lower
simulation times and higher substrate quality. Once the reactor model is fully developed,
the simulation is tailored to the ASALD process environment by customizing various solver,
physics, and personalized settings such as boundary conditions, numerical solver methods,
convergence criteria, user-deﬁned functions, materials, ﬂuid dynamics conditions, and
remeshing methods. This section will discuss the various settings that are integrated into
the macroscopic computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulation.
Ansys Workbench (2022R2), a simulation integration platform, is used to access various
applications for constructing reactors through computer aided design (CAD) software,
performing discretized meshing, and conducting computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD)
simulation. In Ansys Workbench, Ansys DesignModeler is used to build reactor geometries
while the spatiotemporal ﬂuid dynamics of the gas-phase domain inside the designed
reactor conﬁgurations are simulated using Ansys Fluent.

2.3.2. Reactor Geometry and Meshing
Different rotary type reactor conﬁgurations are devised, which originate from indus-
trial patents [60]. Figure 5 illustrates the schematic representation of the spatial reactor
designs to investigate ﬂow proﬁles. R1 has a ring-shaped outlet for each reaction zone
and 6 10-mm round inlets (3 for the reagents and 3 for nitrogen), as depicted in Figure 5a.
Meanwhile, Figure 5b shows R2, and it is designed with three ring, sector-shaped outlets
and 6 round inlets. R3 features asymmetrical round inlets compared to R2 as shown
in Figure 5c. Figure 5d reveals that R4 is equipped with a ring, sector-shaped N2 inlet for
each reaction zone, enclosing a ring, sector-shaped outlet and an asymmetrical annular,
sector-shaped reagent inlet. Each reactor is designed with a diameter of 760 mm, in which
three wafers with a diameter of 200 mm are mounted on the rotating plate at the bottom of
the reactor. The rotating plate spins, causing the wafers to encounter the reaction zones
A, B, and C sequentially. The gas distribution assembly consists of differently shaped
inlets, outlets, and vacuum ports and is located on top of the reactor. With R1 through
R4, the effects of the differences in geometry are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed
to propose an optimal reactor geometry. Finally, with the selected reactor design, process
operation with different operating conditions is explored through multiscale simulations.

(ring or annular sector) and positioning (symmetric or asymmetric) of reagent inlets. Red and blue
areas indicate the outlets and inlets, respectively. 3 wafers are placed at the bottom inside the reactors.
In this study, the operating pressure of the reactor and the vacuum pressure of the
outlets are set to 1330 Pa and −150 Pa, respectively, and the temperature is set to 523 K.
These conditions are considered typical for silicon oxide deposition [9,50]. It is assumed
that a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller regulates the operating temperature
on each wafer surface so that the temperature of the wafers is maintained at a constant
temperature of 523 K. The three reagents (Hacac, BDEAS, and ozone) are injected through
separate inlet ports as a gas mixture with inert gas, N 2. It was reported that there is no
signiﬁcant temperature dependence in the ASALD process [34,50]; therefore, multiscale

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 12 of 26
simulations are performed with a ﬁxed temperature of 523 K while rotation speed is varied
in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 rad/s and the mole fractions of the reagents are varied in the range
of 0.05 to 0.7 each in Section 3.2.
The meshing package on Ansys Workbench is used to generate high-quality meshes.
Mesh discretization is conducted to obtain numerical solutions by adopting the ﬁnite
volume method, and has a signiﬁcant impact on the accuracy of the solution. Tetrahedral
elements are chosen as they are recommended for 3D geometries by providing high mesh
convergence. For mesh sizing, proximity, and curvature, reﬁnements are conducted to
capture more accurate ﬂow proﬁles in thin reactor conﬁgurations. In addition, the face mesh
of the outlets (i.e., vacuum ports) is enhanced through face meshing controls to determine
the suitable divisions of the face mesh. To capture the motion of the rotating boundaries,
the dynamic mesh model is necessary for modeling ﬂow dynamics spatiotemporally. This
feature facilitates the process for updating the volume mesh while preserving the quality of
the mesh. The mesh quality of the reactor conﬁgurations that are developed in this paper
is summarized in Table 1. The constructed meshes are qualiﬁed for CFD simulations in
accordance with the standardized ranges provided by [61].

2.3.3. Characterization of Materials and Macroscopic-Phase Reactions
Ansys Fluent contains a database of material properties that were integrated into the
simulation. The consumption (Hacac, BDEAS, and O 3) and generation (H2O, DEA, and
O2) of various species require the speciﬁcation of thermodynamic properties to simulate
the macroscopic behavior through computational ﬂuid dynamics. However, some thermo-
dynamic properties of the reagents, including Hacac and BDEAS, are limited in literature
and experimental data; thus, ab initio quantum mechanics simulations are performed to
compute the thermophysical parameters (enthalpy of formation, entropy of formation,
speciﬁc heat at constant pressure) for materials with insufﬁcient data. Quantum ESPRESSO
contains programs dedicated to evaluating material properties using density functional
theory (DFT) in conjunction with the Quasi Harmonic Approximation (QHA), which is
integrated to evaluate the material properties. The computed thermophysical properties
were cross-validated with literature results for some properties via the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) database for Hacac and by comparison to similar
molecules such as bis(dimethylamino)silane (BDMAS) for BDEAS. Additionally, properties
including the thermal conductivity and the viscosities were also deﬁned to each gaseous
species. The thermal conductivities of each gas-phase species were approximated to that
of air, which is composed of nitrogen and oxygen gas, and is similar to the composition
of the species in the reactor. The viscosities of each for species not available in the Ansys
Fluent database were obtained through material safety data sheets (MSDS) available online.
As summarized in Table 2, these thermophysical properties are then deﬁned into the
macroscopic simulation on Ansys Fluent for a reference temperature of 273 K.

In the reactor conﬁguration, highly pure ozone is generated from an ozone-enriched
source, which is available in industry [62]. Therefore, it is assumed that ozone is obtained
by liquid ozone from an ozone generator and fed to spatial reactors through the O3 injec-
tion port. However, as an oxidizing agent, ozone is used in Step C, which is capable of
decomposing in the ﬂuid phase at high operating temperatures in a mechanism that was
ﬁrst proposed in 1957 [63]. Thus, it is important to account for this thermal decomposition
of ozone, which is a highly unstable molecule, in the macroscopic CFD simulation.
O3 ⇌ O2 + 2O
O + O3 →O2
Apart from the surface kinetics established by the mesoscopic model, the volumetric
reactions from the ozone decomposition are directly deﬁned in the macroscopic model.
All kinetic parameters for the decomposition of ozone were determined by [ 63]. The
consumption of O3 and generation of O2 are calculated and included in the mass balance
equation for ozone in Equation (8).

gravitational acceleration constant, − →F is the external body force, E is the internal energy
of the system, hj symbolizes the sensible enthalpy of species j, Jj represents the diffusion
ﬂux of species j, and Sh denotes the heat ﬂux source rate term. Spatiotemporal numeri-
cal solutions for each node in the mesh are computed with the pressure-based coupled
solver provided by Ansys Fluent, which simultaneously solves the mass and momentum
continuity equations, Equations (8) and (9), with greater computational efﬁciency and
convergence speed compared to the segregated pressure-based solver approach. To model
the temporal dynamics, a transient solver method is proposed by adopting a ﬁrst-order
implicit formulation with a ﬁxed 0.001 s time interval. Although higher order methods
could have been employed to reduce the global error induced from the numerical method,
the ﬁrst-order implicit method was chosen to lessen the overall computation time of the
process while preserving convergence criteria. Lastly, the Gauss-Seidel iterative method is
utilized to solve algebraic systems by default.

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 14 of 26
2.3.5. Simulation Modeling
Several features are deﬁned to reduce the degrees of freedom by specifying boundary
conditions and ﬂuid ﬂow conditions. No-slip and zero diffusion ﬂux boundary conditions
are deﬁned to the reactor walls for simplicity and surface of the substrate to resemble the
self-limiting behavior of the ASALD process. Various in silico modeling works [ 64–66]
have assumed laminar ﬂow conditions, which are applicable in industry [67]. However,
notable disadvantages [68] of laminar ﬂow conditions are irrelevant to this study due to
the substrate being small in diameter (200 mm, in Section 2.3.2) and the reactor design is
modeled to limit depleted reagents along the perimeter of the reaction zones.
The most notable advantage of Ansys Fluent is its high versatility in the form of User-
Deﬁned Functions (UDFs). A UDF is a function that is able to enhance CFD simulations
by customizing boundary conditions, deﬁning material properties, and even initializing
simulations, for instance. In this study, several UDFs are utilized to deﬁne mass ﬂow
rates and reagent mole fractions, source terms for species generation and consumption,
temperature, the motion of the wafers with respect to the reactor, and allocating indexes in
User-Deﬁned Memories (UDMs). UDMs allow Ansys Fluent to ﬁnd the appropriate nodes
for computing reagent consumption and byproduct generation. Additionally, wafers are
radially sliced into 10 equiangular sections so that mesoscopic simulations are executed
in parallel, as shown in Figure 6. Thus, 10 mesoscopic simulations are conducted on each
wafer, and the coverage on the 10 sections of a wafer from the mesoscopic simulation is
computed as an area-weighted average. Given that 3 wafers are equipped in a spatial
reactor, 30 UDMs must be applied to specify the nodes in which the consumption and
generation of species take place.
Due to the versatility and advantages mentioned in Section 1 of numerical multi-
physics modeling, computational ﬂuid dynamics studies are broadly applied for industrial
processes under various operating conditions. However, the computation efﬁciency (e.g.,
computational burden and time) heavily relies on computing resources. For example,
to reduce numerical errors, high-order numerical methods with extremely ﬁne meshes
increase computing costs. Therefore, appropriate size of the mesh elements and numerical
methods should be employed. In this study, 36-core dual processors with 384 GB of RAM
(Random-Access Memory) are utilized to simulate the multiscale CFD model.

surface area-averaged pressures to evaluate an averaged surface coverage, and source generation
and consumption rates.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Reactor Optimization
In the design of the reactors for ABC-ASALD processes, the most important criterion
considered is the ﬁlm uniformity, as it is directly related to the quality of semiconductor
chips. A reactor with high ﬁlm uniformity guarantees precise control over the thickness of

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 15 of 26
deposition ﬁlms when constructing 3D features on nanochips. When discussing ﬁlm uni-
formity, there are several other factors that may be evaluated with a more rapid turnaround
time than directly measuring ﬁlm uniformity, such as the reagent exposure time distribution
of the substrate and whether there is any intermixing present.
3.1.1. Exposure Time Distribution
The exposure time is deﬁned as the amount of time that a section of the substrate is
exposed to the reagents. Depending on reactor geometry and design, the exposure time may
vary across the surface of the wafer. Thus, it is vital to examine the distribution of exposure
times for various reactors and ensure a tight distribution of exposure times. For a spatial
reactor, the exposure time for a speciﬁc point is determined not by the gas distribution
device, but rather by the shape of the reaction zones where the substrate enters by the
rotation of the bottom plate. To investigate the effect that reaction zone conﬁgurations
have on the exposure time distribution, steady-state and dynamic simulations of R1, which
has circular reaction zones, and R4, which has annular-sectioned reaction zones, were
performed with a reactant mole fraction of 0.1 and with an angular velocity of 0.8 rad/s.
The results are displayed in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Hacac partial pressure over time on a node in the mesh. As the wafer rotates, the pressure
rises around 0.8 s to reach the plateau and goes to 0 around 3.6 s. The length of the straight line in red
is deﬁned as the exposure time.
To evaluate the exposure time distribution for Hacac, the partial pressure of Hacac
was recorded at every node of the meshed wafer surface as it traveled through the Hacac
reaction zone. This data was then used to determine how long each wafer node spent
saturated with Hacac, which is the exposure time. After being processed, all the nodal
data was plotted in Figure 8c,d, and the wafer surface contours for all nodes are shown
in Figure 8a,b. Results suggest that the geometry of the reaction zones for R1 and R4,
which are presented in Figure 5a,d, respectively, directly affect the distribution of nodal
exposure time.
From a physical standpoint, the exposure time distribution is expected to exhibit low
variance when all the nodes on the moving wafer experience the same amount of time
in the reaction zone. However, the proposed circular spatial reactor differs from a linear
sheet-to-sheet reactor in that the wafers are rotating in an angular fashion around the
reactor, causing the edge of the wafer that is furthest from the center of the reactor to be
traveling at a faster tangential velocity. Thus, to ensure that each point of the wafer spends
the same amount of time in the reaction zone, the ideal reaction zone shape must consist of
arc lengths that are solely dependent on their radial distance from the center of the reactor.
This condition is best fulﬁlled by the annular-sectioned reaction zones of reactor R4. For
reactor R1, however, the central region of the substrate is expected to have longer exposure
times compared to that of the outer region of the substrate due to the round reaction zone,
which is easily demonstrated by examining the point on the wafer that is the furthest from
the center of the reactor. This point will only be present in the reaction zone for a short time

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 16 of 26
as the arc length of the reaction zone at that radius is small; thus, all sections of the wafer
will not be exposed at the same time.
As illustrated in Figure 8c, the bar chart for R1 shows that the reactor has a wide
exposure time distribution, especially when compared to the tightly centered exposure
time distribution of R4, whose bar chart is found in Figure 8d. While the average exposure
time for both reactors is around 2.7 s, with R1 having an average exposure time of 2.717 s
and R4 having an average exposure time of 2.701 s, the two vary greatly in terms of the
standard deviation; the standard deviation of R1 and R4 were computed as 0.1925 and
0.0079, respectively. This large difference in standard deviation between the two reactors
aligns with the predicted result, and it demonstrates that the standard deviation of the
exposure times on the wafer is directly correlated to the shape of the reaction zones. To
produce ﬁlms with high uniformity, the reactor must have reaction zones shaped like
annular sections as shown in R4.

3.1.2. Intermixing
The uniformity of the ﬁlm produced by a spatial reactor is not solely dependent on
the exposure time distribution and the shape of the reactor zones. Another crucial factor is
the gas distribution across the reaction and purge zones. A nonuniform gas distribution
causes the residence time of the reagents across the wafer to vary, which prevents the
reactor from achieving optimal surface coverage and high ﬁlm uniformity [ 67]. Inside
spatial reactors, reagents are successfully separated from the reaction zone by the injection
of N2 gas, thereby establishing a boundary layer that prevents the diffusion of the reagents
into the purging region by convection. As the gas ﬂow inside the reactor is assumed to be

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 17 of 26
laminar in Section 2.3, nonuniform gas distribution mainly occurs when reactants cross
into the purge zones. This phenomenon is named intermixing, and preventing it is vital
to ensure uniform ﬁlm growth. Intermixing is mainly caused by the substrate physically
dragging unreacted reactants into the purge zone, which means that it is correlated to
three features of reactor design: the gap distance, the wafer velocity, and the vacuum
pressure. As intermixing is a binary criterion in that it is either present or is not, it is best
to ﬁrst determine the domain in which no intermixing is present before identifying other
criteria such as fastest computational speed or fastest processing speed to select the optimal
reactor design.
The gap distance is deﬁned as the distance separating the wafer and the gas distri-
bution assembly, and it is one of the most important factors in effectuating self-limiting
behavior and minimizing reagent intermixing. In this work, the effects of gap distance on
intermixing was studied with R2 at different gap distances of 10 mm, 5 mm, and 1 mm. As
shown by N2 mole fraction contours in Figure 9, a lower gap distance inhibits reagent inter-
mixing in the purging regions. This observation of how gap distance affects intermixing
has been explored in several works for different spatial reactor conﬁgurations [40,41].

Figure 9. Contours of the mole fraction of nitrogen on the plate rotating clockwise in R2 with gap
distances of 10 mm, 5 mm, and 1 mm in various angular velocities, which depict the invasion of N2
into the reaction zones and reagent runoff into the purge zones at higher rotation speeds.
However, despite lower gap distances reducing the intermixing of reagents, a higher
number of discretized elements are needed to resolve boundary layers around separating
chambers to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model, which carries greater computa-
tional burden. Thus, this study will account for a balance in the computational efﬁciency of
the multiscale simulation and effective reagent separation. For the aforementioned reasons,
a 5-mm gap distance is integrated into the idealized reactor conﬁguration.
The wafer velocity also affects the intermixing of reagents. Greater angular velocities
were observed to increase intermixing in response to the push of reagents in the direction
of the angular rotation of the wafer. Both Figures 9 and 10 show how the N2 mole fraction
contours change with the angular wafer velocity. Figure 10 in particular, reveals that the
invasion of the inert gas (denoted by the ring in orange) at the entry of the reaction zone
and the reagent runoff (denoted by the ring in green) at the exit are both conveyed in the
direction of the wafer rotation (counter-clockwise). Thus, these instances of intermixing
are attributed to the motion of the wafer. As shown in Figure 9, with a 5-mm gap distance,
the inert gas of N2 is observed to enter the reaction zone when the angular wafer velocity
is above 1.0 rad/s. The reagent enters the purge zone when the angular wafer velocity

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 18 of 26
is above 1.2 rad/s. Thus, to maintain a self-limiting reaction with no intermixing, the
rotation speed must be kept below 1.0 rad/s. Thus, it is imperative to construct a reactor
conﬁguration that handles sufﬁciently high angular velocities to reduce process time while
simultaneously producing uniform deposition and promoting effective reagent separation.
To establish effective gas separation and an acceptable process time, it is essential
to choose an appropriate rotation speed and gap distance to achieve precise thin ﬁlm
thickness control and surface uniformity. While lower gap distances minimize the effects of
reagent intermixing, several operating and reactor design conditions are also considered
for minimizing the intermixing of reagents. Thus, an effective balance between the gap
distance, (selected to be 5 mm), the vacuum pressure (chosen to be −150 Pa), and the
orientation (symmetrical or asymmetrical) of the injection ports are methodically chosen to
enable a higher range of substrate angular velocities to be used for the process. For instance,
the reactor model R3 repositions the cylindrical injection ports closer to the substrate
entry in the reaction zone as shown in Figure 5c, which establishes an asymmetrical inlet
conﬁguration. The mole fraction contours of N2 for reactor model R3 in Figure 10 shows
marginal improvement of intermixing, particularly in the reagent runoff from the reaction
zone at 1.0 rad/s as opposed to that of R2, which was modeled with a symmetrical inlet
arrangement. R4 (as shown in Figure 5d), with annular sector-shaped reagent inlets, was
proposed to further mitigate intermixing as shown in Figure 10. To be speciﬁc, the invasion
of the inert gas into the reaction zone disappears at both 0.8 and 1.0 rad/s in contrast with
R2 and R3, which both still show signs of intermixing at those velocities. Therefore, R4 is
selected as the desired reactor conﬁguration to explore the ASALD process to discuss the
quantitative relationship between various operating conditions on the surface coverage
in Section 3.2.

3.2. Multiscale Simulation Results
The reactor optimization study examines the impact that the gap distance, the injection
and outlet port geometry, and the wafer angular velocity have on reagent separation,
exposure time distribution, reagent distribution on the substrate surface, and computational
efﬁciency. After considering all the above criteria, reactor model R4 was designed with a
5-mm gap distance. The next component of this work will examine the effects that operating
conditions such as wafer velocity and reagent mole fractions have on the surface coverage
for Steps A, B, and C.
The simulations were conducted with a range of rotation speeds, ω, (0.2 rad/s ≤ω ≤
0.8 rad/s) and a range of reactant species mole fraction, x (0.05 ≤x ≤0.70) to determine
optimal operating conditions to achieve complete surface coverage. For all steps, the surface
coverage depends on the rotation speeds and the mole fractions of the reactant species, as
illustrated in Figure 11. In general, the coverage for each step increases as the mole fraction
of the reactant species increases and as the rotation speed decreases. An increase in the

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 19 of 26
mole fraction of the reactant species naturally leads to an increase in the partial pressure of
the species, which accelerates the reaction rates for all adsorption reactions according to
Collision Theory. Furthermore, a lower rotation speed allows the wafer to be exposed to
the reagent for a longer period of time, thus increasing the surface coverage. Speciﬁcally,
the Hacac step reaches full coverage at 0.2 rad/s with Hacac mole fractions of xHacac = 0.05,
0.1, and 0.3. However, the coverage decreases with increasing rotation speed. At 0.6 rad/s,
full coverage is only achieved with xHacac = 0.3; for lower Hacac mole fractions, surface
coverages of 98.8% and 95.1% were observed. BDEAS and ozone coverage curves also
reveal a similar trend. However, the curves for BDEAS appear discontinuous, which is
attributed to its proposed kinetic mechanism. An observable limitation of the kMC method
is that the algorithm requires a priori knowledge of a reaction mechanism [ 69] that, if
exceedingly simpliﬁed, will reduce the accuracy of the kMC model when trying to predict
realistic surface kinetics. Figure 11b exempliﬁes a noncompetitive BDEAS adsorption in
which desorption and intermediate pathways are not immediately observed after the
adsorption reaction takes place. This work utilized a kinetics mechanism determined
by [33] with large activation energy differences that were evaluated using the nudged
elastic band method by [34]. Such reaction mechanism introduces a spontaneous reaction
path where the surface coverage is dictated by the large reaction rate constant differences
that generate this noncompetitive kinetics mechanism, where one reaction path dominates.
Additionally, the repulsive forces due to the steric effects reduced the versatility of pursuing
intermediate or reverse reaction paths, therefore, producing steeper coverage curves.

Noncompetitive kinetics offer insight to the discontinuous curves presented in Figure 11;
however, the mole fraction gradient along the boundary between the purging and reaction
zone presents a challenge for collecting pertinent surface pressure data that will capture

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 20 of 26
the initial adsorption step for smaller time and length scales. This concentration gradient
is presented in Figure 12, which illustrates the lack of nodal data due to the small length
scales required to collect additional pressure data. Additionally, at higher angular velocities,
the collection of nodal data becomes more challenging due to this small boundary length
scale (in µm), which is another reason for the discontinuous curves generated in Figure 11.
Consequently, the smaller length scale in micrometers would require smaller time scales
(milliseconds) to collect surface coverage data within this boundary layer, as illustrated
in Figure 2. Thus, the spatiotemporal progression of coverage of the wafer surface would
be more difﬁcult to simulate at the reaction zone entrances.
Figure 12. Concentration gradient of N2 mole fraction for R4 illustrating the small length scales in
micrometers for each contour along the reagent-purge boundary region, which limits the availability
for studying the temporal progression of surface coverage as depicted in Figure 2.
When comparing the multiscale CFD simulation process times to reach full coverage
compared to that of the mesoscopic model from prior work [ 34], the multiscale CFD
simulation process times were slower. The integration of the macroscopic model to the
mesoscopic model introduced pressure depletion zones that diluted the surface exposure
to reagents, thereby reducing the adsorption reaction rates for Hacac and BDEAS. For a
constant temperature of 523 K and constant Hacac surface pressure of 130 Pa (Step A), a
constant BDEAS surface pressure of 400 Pa (Step B), and a constant O3 pressure of 130 Pa
(Step C), the mesoscopic simulation evaluated complete coverage times of 2.29 s, 2.28 s,
and 3.81 s, respectively [34]. The multiscale CFD simulation results with similar reactor
operating conditions require process times of 3.77 s, 6.99 s, and 3.72 s to achieve full
coverage for Steps A, B, and C, respectively as illustrated in Figure 13. The integration of
macroscopic ﬂuid behavior with the mesoscopic model indicates that the reagent depletion
zones and repulsions generated by species intercollisions in the ﬂuid phase contribute to
the substantial increase in the process times, which was observed from a prior multiscale
modeling work [ 70]. However, the proposed model, which partitions the wafer into
10 sections and performs 10 kMC simulations on each section, inaccurately characterizes
the surface coverage progression as a function of time. Ideally, a kMC simulation for
each node on the wafer surface would greatly improve the accuracy of the times to obtain
complete surface coverage, but comes at a computational cost. However, the results are
consistent with experimental ﬁndings where Hacac dosage times of 5 s in similar operating
conditions were used to ensure complete surface coverage [9]. Additionally, BDEAS dosage
times of 6 s were employed to maximize the deposition thickness of the SiO2 surface [33],

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 21 of 26
although, greater dosage times were observed to contribute to the nucleation of the oxide
ﬁlm if BDEAS is oversaturated in the reactor. To prevent such a scenario, the rotary reactor
design evacuates unreacted reagent through the purge streams, thereby maintaining the
operating pressure of the reagent within the reaction zone. Lastly, O3 dosage times of 2.5 s
to 20 s to achieve complete surface coverage [ 71], which is analogous to the multiscale
computed time.

than observed mesoscopic model process times conducted from prior work [34].
Figure 14 illustrates the contours of species mole fractions simulated with a constant
rotation speed of 0.4 rad/s and a mole fraction of 0.3 for Hacac, BDEAS, and ozone. Due
to the ﬁxed rotation speed imposed to the three wafers, the equal areas of each wafer are
exposed to each reagent as shown in Figure 14a. However, the reaction progression for each
reaction, which is inspected by measuring the generation of byproducts from the wafer
surface, is different as revealed in Figure 14b–d. As discussed above, BDEAS adsorption
requires higher mole fraction and lower rotation speeds to achieve complete coverage
compared with Hacac and ozone adsorption. Despite the fact that more than half of the
wafer area is in the BDEAS-enriched reaction zone (in Figure 14c), the byproduct, DEA, is
only observed in a small area, which is the area that ﬁrst encountered the reagent due to the
BDEAS adsorption mechanism, and the steric effects discussed in Section 2.2. Meanwhile,
H2O produced from Hacac adsorption and O 2 produced from O3 adsorption are being
generated on the region closer to the boundary between the reagent and the inert gas. In
other words, Step A and Step C are faster than Step B, which is in agreement with ab initio
DFT calculation results [34,50,72] where the BDEAS adsorption undergoes multiple steps
that have higher activation energies than Hacac and ozone. Therefore, the mole fractions

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 22 of 26
of reactants must be carefully selected to optimize the process. When selecting operating
conditions, the BDEAS and Ozone steps can be ﬁrstly considered since Hacac is covered
on the non-growth area at the ﬁrst cycle and afterward, only the deprived reaction sites
are reﬁlled and reinforced. From the multiscale simulations, the mole fractions of 0.1, 0.5,
and 0.1 for Hacac, BDEAS, and O3, respectively, and a rotation speed of 0.2 rad/s can be
considered as an optimal operating condition for full coverage.

4. Conclusions
An in silico multiscale computational ﬂuid dynamics model was developed for an
area-selective atomic layer deposition (ASALD) process on the substrate of SiO2/Al2O3
utilizing a spatial reactor design. Three reagents were used to deposit SiO2 thin ﬁlms on the
growth area (SiO2) and to create protective layers on the nongrowth area (Al2O3): the in-
hibitor (acetylacetone or Hacac), precursor (bis(diethylamino)silane or BDEAS), and oxidant
(ozone) for Steps A through C, respectively. This model included an atomistic-mesoscopic
model using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) and a macroscopic model using computational
ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). Foremost, a spatial reactor conﬁguration was optimized to ensure
uniform reagent exposure time distribution and effective reagent separation to ensure self-
limiting behavior was maintained. The gap distance, rotation speed, and reactor geometries
were observed to have great inﬂuence on transport behavior of gas species. Lower gap
distances and rotational speeds are required to avoid reagent intermixing. In addition,
a ring, sector-shaped outlet and N 2 inlet improved reagent separation by removing the
reagent runoff and inert invasion; thus creating a low variance gas distribution, leading
to uniform exposure to reagents. A more uniform ﬂow was observed with asymmetrical,
annular, sector-shaped reagent inlets. After an optimal reactor conﬁguration was built, the

Coatings 2023, 13, 558 23 of 26
multiscale model was simulated within the operating range of 0.2 rad/s ≤ω ≤0.8 rad/s
with different mole fractions of species for Hacac, BDEAS, and ozone. Sufﬁciently low
angular speeds were required for complete surface deposition by providing longer expo-
sure time to the reagents. A higher mole fraction of species also accelerated the adsorption
reactions to reach complete coverage.
It is essential to choose an appropriate mole fraction of each reagent, since all reaction
zones rotate at the same velocity. Since the BDEAS reaction takes longer time, a higher mole
fraction for BDEAS than the ones for Hacac and ozone is required to obtain full coverage
at the same wafer rotation speed. Due to the advantage of this modeling study that can
generate a broad set of data at varying operating conditions, this in silico work has the
potential to expedite reaction scale-up in industry. Therefore, this modeling approach
offers insights and data to process engineers to select proper operating conditions for
further process development. On top of that, this study presents guidelines to design
and optimize a rotary type spatial reactor in an industrial setting. Finally, as described
in Section 1, further research is needed to design an optimal control system for robust
process operation. Speciﬁcally, given the complexity of the reaction taking place inside these
reactors, advanced control methods for ASALD (e.g., model predictive control, artiﬁcial
neural network-based run-to-run control) can be developed in a future work to ensure
robust process operation.
