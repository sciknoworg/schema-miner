Abstract
The growth-per-cycle (GPC) in the trimethylaluminum/water atomic layer deposition (ALD) process is shown to be
quantitatively correlated with the surface OH group concentration before the trimethylaluminum reaction. The correlation
corresponds to a reaction chemistry, where several types of gas–solid reactions (ligand exchange, dissociation/association) can
occur simultaneously, and where steric hindrance by adsorbed methyl groups terminates the trimethylaluminum reaction. The
commonly assumed reaction chemistry where one OH group bonds one aluminum atom through ligand exchange does not
describe satisfactorily the trimethylaluminum/water process, and should perhaps not be expected to describe other ALD
processes either.

Conformal layers of inorganic materials with
thickness down to the nanometer range can be grown
by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a technique
developed in the 1960s[1,2] that relies on sequential
self-terminating gas–solid reactions [1–5]. Several
ALD-grown oxide materials, such as Al2O3, ZrO2 and
HfO2, ﬁnd applications in catalysis, electrolumines-
cent displays and microelectronics [3–5].
Oxide (MO n/2) ALD processes often consist of
repeating cycles of two reactions: the reaction of a
metal–ligand compound (MLn) and the reaction of
water (H2O), denoted here MLn/H2O ALD processes.
Typically, MLn is assumed to react through ‘‘ligand
exchange’’ with one or more ( y) surface hydroxyl
(OH) groups, releasing HL as a gaseous reaction
product, and attaching a MLn/C0y species to the surface

phase) [3–5]:
yjj/C0OH þ MLnðgÞ ! ðjj/C0O/C0ÞyMLn/C0y
þ yHLðgÞ (1)
Water reacts with the adsorbed ligands, replacing them
with OH groups and releasing more HL:
jj/C0L þ H2OðgÞ ! jj/C0OH þ HLðgÞ (2)
These OH groups react again with the ML n molecule
in the next reaction cycle. According to this scheme,
OH groups mediate the ALD growth of oxide materi-
als.
The growth-per-cycle (GPC) [6–11] in the ML n/
H2O ALD processes typically decreases with increas-
ing ALD processing temperature [12–15].T h e
decrease in GPC is often explained [13–15] by
dehydroxylation, a process where two OH groups
combine to form an oxygen bridge and release water,
thereby decreasing the surface OH group concentra-
tion[16,17]:
jj/C0OH þ jj/C0OH ! jj/C0O/C0jj þH2OðgÞ (3)
A quantitative description of the effect of surface OH
groups on the surface chemistry and GPC has been
lacking, however.
The trimethylaluminum/water (AlMe 3/H2O) ALD
process is known as an almost ideal ALD process: it
results in a high GPC (30 –40% of a monolayer); it
coats surfaces of complex shape with a uniform layer
of Al2O3, and the gaseous reaction product, methane,
is inert and does not interfere with the growth[15,18].
This work investigates published quantitative data
[15,19–22] and looks for a correlation between the
surface OH group concentration and the surface
chemistry in the AlMe3/H2O ALD process. A linear
correlation is found, according to which deposition
occurs also on oxide surfaces with no OH groups. The
physical signiﬁcance of the correlation is discussed in
terms of the experimental [13,15,19–21,23–25] and
theoretical [15,26] understanding of the surface
chemistry.
The AlMe3 reaction has been investigated in detail
on high-surface-area alumina and silica substrates.
The reaction temperature has been varied [21],
because it may affect the reaction mechanisms in
ALD[27]. By varying the heat-treatment temperature,
in turn, the type and number of bonding sites on the
surface, most particularly of the OH groups, have been
controlled [19–22]. The amounts of OH groups, Al
atoms and C atoms [with C in methyl (CH 3, Me)
groups] have been measured as weight percentages by
chemical means, which have then been converted to
numbers per unit surface area using the speci ﬁc
surface area of the substrate [19–22]. On alumina
substrates, where the amount of added Al atoms is
difﬁcult to measure, the amount of Al atoms adsorbed
per cycle DcAl [nm/C02] has been calculated from the
mass balance [8,21]:
DcAl ¼ 1
3ðDcMe þ cðOÞHÞ; (4)
where DcMe [nm/C02] is the surface concentration of Me
groups adsorbed in the AlMe 3 reaction and cðOÞH
[nm/C02] is the surface concentration of OH groups
before the AlMe 3 reaction [28].
The amount of aluminum adsorbed DcAl in the
reaction of AlMe 3 with high-surface area alumina is
insensitive to the reaction temperature ( Fig. 1 ).
Increasing the substrate heat-treatment temperature,
in turn, decreases theDcAl on both high-surface-area
alumina and silica ( Fig. 2) [19–21]. As expected, the
decrease in DcAl coincides with the decrease in
surface OH group concentration cðOÞH. However,
cðOÞH decreases faster with increasing temperature
than DcAl, and at higher heat-treatment temperatures,
cðOÞH is even lower thanDcAl. The quantitative results
obtained for alumina and silica differ.
To investigate the quantitative effect of cðOÞH on
GPC, DcAl is plotted as function of cðOÞH in Fig. 3(a)
[19–22]. For reference, the amount of methyl groups
adsorbed DcMe and the average Me/Al ratio on the
surface DcMe/ DcAl are also shown [Fig. 3(b) and (c)]

Fig. 1. Effect of AlMe 3 reaction temperature on the amount of
aluminum adsorbed, DcAl, in the AlMe3 reaction with alumina heat-
treated at 560 /C14C (adapted from reference [21]). Results up to
reaction at 300 /C14C are shown; above 300 /C14C, AlMe3 decomposes
[21,29]. A line has been ﬁtted to the experimental data; the con-
ﬁdence limits represent 1 standard deviation.

[19–22]. The results obtained for alumina and silica
substrates now settle to the same trend. Rather than
the chemical composition of the substrate, thecðOÞH
therefore seems to de ﬁne the DcAl. The amount of
aluminum adsorbed, DcAl, increases linearly with
increasing OH surface concentration cðOÞH:
DcAl ¼ a þ bcðOÞH
¼ð 1:68 /C60:09Þþð 0:37 /C60:02ÞcðOÞH (5)
Although cðOÞH is clearly an important parameter
in controlling the surface chemistry of the AlMe 3
reaction, there is no one-to-one correspondence
betweencðOÞH and DcAl (b 6¼1). Moreover, deposition
is expected also on oxide surfaces with no OH groups
(a > 0).
The physical signi ﬁcance behind the empirical
parameters a and b of Eq. (5) is of fundamental
interest. Parameter a describes how many aluminum
atoms adsorb in the self-terminating AlMe 3 reaction
on oxide surfaces with no OH groups. In addition to
ligand exchange with OH groups, AlMe3 can adsorb
onto oxygen bridges through dissociation, and perhaps
association (Fig. 4 ) [13,15,21,23–26]. On oxide
surfaces with no OH groups, AlMe 3 must chemisorb
purely through dissociation or association, resulting in
a Me/Al ratio of 3 on the surface. As the Me/Al ratio is
3, the number of aluminum atoms adsorbed should be
one-third of the number of methyl groups adsorbed at
saturation. The number of aluminum atoms adsorbed
DcAl at cðOÞH ¼ 0 equals a and is (1:68 /C60:09) nm/C02.
Multiplication of a with 3 gives the expected number
of methyl groups adsorbed on oxide surfaces with no
OH groups, ð5:0 /C60:3Þ nm/C02. This number agrees
with the experimental DcMe measured for low OH
group concentrations [ Fig. 3 (b)]. Parameter a is
therefore physically signiﬁcant: it equals one-third of
the number of methyl groups adsorbed in the AlMe 3
reaction on oxide surfaces with no OH groups.

adsorbed, DcMe, and (c) the average Me/Al ratio in the adsorbed species (DcMe=DcAl) (data forDcAl and cðOÞH from Figs. 1 and 2; data for DcMe
from references[19–21]). In panels (a) and (b), solid lines showﬁts to the experimental data; the conﬁdence limits represent 1 standard deviation.
The dashed line in panels (a –c) show the results expected for the chemistry of Eq. (6) (with Dcmax
Me ¼ 6:0n m/C02).

Parameterb describes how many aluminum atoms on
average are attached on the surface per added OH group.
One additional OH group does not attach one additional
aluminum atom (b < 1) but only about one-third of it
[b ¼ð 0:37 /C60:02Þ]. In other words, almost three (b/C01)
OH groups are needed for attaching one additional
aluminum atom. Exactly three [ ð1=3Þ/C01]O H
groups would be needed for adsorbing one additional
aluminum atom, if the number of methyl groups
adsorbedDcMe was constant (see the mass balance, Eq.
(4)). The DcMe is indeed almost independent of cðOÞH
[Fig. 3(b)] [30]. The fact that approximately three OH
groups are needed for attaching one additional
aluminum atom is consistent with the Me/Al ratio of
3i nt h eA l M e3 reactant and that steric hindrance of
methyl groups causes the reaction to terminate, resulting
in approximately constant number of methyl groups
adsorbed[19–21]: three OH groups are needed to
release the three methyl groups of one AlMe3 molecule
as methane, thereby attaching one additional aluminum
atom to the surface. Parameterb is therefore also
physically signiﬁcant.
It is important to know whether the correlation of
Eq. (5), derived from results obtained on high-surface-
area substrates, can be generalized also for the AlMe3/
H2O ALD process on ﬂat substrates. As recently
reviewed [15], the GPC DcAl in the AlMe3/H2O ALD
process on ﬂat substrates decreases approximately
linearly with increasing ALD processing temperature,
from about ð4:7 /C60:6Þ nm/C02 at 200 /C14C to about
ð3:9 /C60:6Þ nm/C02 at 300 /C14C. Comparison of these
GPC values with those of Fig. 2(a) shows quantitative
agreement, within error limits of approximately 1
standard deviation. Therefore, the results on the two
types of substrates seem to agree, and Eq. (5) should
be valid also for the AlMe 3/H2O ALD process on ﬂat
substrates.
The surface chemistry of the ML n/H2O ALD
process, including the AlMe 3/H2O process, is com-
monly treated in a simpli ﬁed manner, assuming that
MLn reacts with one OH group, attaching a ML n/C01
species on the surface [e.g.,Fig. 4(a)] [4,7,9,13,24,26].
The amount of aluminum adsorbed DcAl [nm/C02]
should in such reaction scheme increase linearly with
the surface OH group concentrationcðOÞH [nm/C02]
until a certain critical value, limited by steric
hindrance, is reached:

In this equation, Dcmax
Me [nm/C02]d e n o t e s[8,15] the
methyl group surface concentration when steric hin-
drance, not a limited number of OH groups, causes the
reaction to terminate (Dcmax
Me /C256:0n m/C02) [19,21].A s
shown in Fig. 3,E q . (6) fails to describe the experi-
mental data, indicating that the simple reaction scheme
that one OH group would bond one aluminum atom is
not valid for the AlMe3/H2O process. An analogous
reaction scheme should perhaps not be expected to be
valid for other MLn/H2O ALD processes either.
In conclusion, a quantitative linear correlation has
been found between the GPC in the AlMe3/H2O ALD
process and the surface OH group concentration. From
this correlation, the GPC can be calculated, if the
surface OH group concentration is known. The

parameters of the correlation are physically mean-
ingful and correspond to the reaction chemistry, where
several types of reactions can occur simultaneously,
and steric hindrance by methyl groups terminates the
reaction.

[6] GPC can be expressed for an ML n/H2O ALD process, for
example, as the amount of M atoms deposited per unit surface

[28] In the mass balance (Eq. (4)), the change in the number of OH
groups DcðOÞH during the reaction should in principle be used
instead of the total number of OH groups before the reaction
cðOÞH [8]. The use of cðOÞH is justi ﬁed, however, because
practically all OH groups react with AlMe 3 [20,21].

[30] The deviation of b/C01 from three originates from the small
increase of DcMe with increasing cðOÞH. The increase of DcMe
is possible in the case when the methyl ligands can be packed
closer to each other in the surface layer at lower values of z in
the AlMez surface species.
