ABSTRACT: Area-selective atomic layer deposition using small-molecule
inhibitors (SMIs) involves vapor-phase dosing of inhibitor molecules,
resulting in an industry-compatible approach. However, the identification of
suitable SMIs that yield a high selectivity remains a challenging task.
Recently, aniline (C
6
H
5
NH
2
) was shown to be an effective SMI during the
area-selective deposition (ASD) of TiN, giving 6 nm of selective growth on
SiO
2
in the presence of Ru and Co non-growth areas. In this work, using
density functional theory (DFT) and random sequential adsorption (RSA)
simulations, we investigated how aniline can effectively block precursor
adsorption on specific areas. Our DFT calculations confirmed that aniline
selectively adsorbs on Ru and Co non-growth areas, whereas its adsorption
on the SiO
2
growth area is limited to physisorption. DFT reveals two stable
adsorption configurations of aniline on the metal surfaces. Further
calculations on the aniline-functionalized surfaces show that the aniline inhibitor significantly reduces the interaction of Ti
precursor, tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium, with the non-growth area. In addition, RSA simulations showed that the co-presence of
two stable adsorption configurations allows for a high surface inhibitor coverage on both Co and Ru surfaces. As the surface
saturates, there is a transition from the thermodynamically most favorable adsorption configuration to the sterically most favorable
adsorption configuration, which results in a sufficiently dense inhibition layer, such that an incoming precursor molecule cannot fit in
between the adsorbed precursor molecules. We also found that, as a result of the catalytic activity of the metallic non-growth area,
further reactions of inhibitor molecules, such as hydrogenolysis, can play a role in precursor blocking.

INTRODUCTION
The continued downscaling of feature sizes in integrated
circuits leads to new challenges in the semiconductor
industry.
1
Most of the conventional fabrication processes are
designed on the basis of the top-down approach, comprising
numerous deposition, lithography, and etching steps.
2,3
At
small feature sizes, traditional top-down approaches suffer from
alignment issues between the patterning steps.
4
Therefore,
processes exploiting the properties of the underlying pattern
instead of purely relying on metrology and patterning precision
are needed.
5,6
During the past decade, area-selective deposition
(ASD), a bottom-up alternative enabling self-aligned fabrica-
tion schemes, has gained considerable attention in academia
and industry.
7−9
ASD refers to processes that deposit the target
material on the areas where the growth is desired (i.e., growth
areas), while deposition is avoided on the neighboring areas
where the growth is not desired (non-growth areas). The
selectivity of deposition on the growth areas can be achieved
by exploiting differences in the chemical or physical properties,
such as different material compositions, surface terminations,
or lattice properties.
6,7,10,11
In some specific cases, an inherent selectivity may be
observed as a result of the nature of the growth and non-
growth areas.
8,12
However, typically, selectivity is achieved via
the deactivation of the non-growth area using inhibitors, for
example, using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) or small-
molecule inhibitors (SMIs).
6,11−18
SAMs, containing long-
chain hydrocarbons, have conventionally been used as
inhibitors to achieve area-selective atomic layer deposition
(ALD).
19,20
However, as a result of the low vapor pressure of
these large molecules, application of SAMs typically relies on
wet chemistry and requires long reaction times to achieve close
packing.
21−24
These properties limit the compatibility of SAMs
with high-volume applications in the industry.

alternative, the use of SMIs recently showed promising results
for area-selective ALD.
3,15,25−27
SMIs can be supplied into the
vacuum reactor during the deposition via vapor-phase
dosing.
28
As a result, inhibitors can be applied in much
shorter time scales in the same vacuum vessel as used for the
ALD process and can therefore more easily be integrated in
industrial fabrication schemes.
22
The area-selective ALD
approach relying on vapor-phase reapplication of SMIs at the
start of every ALD cycle can be employed using both thermal
or plasma-enhanced conditions.
22
To successfully block the interaction of the incoming
precursor molecules with the non-growth area during ASD,
candidate SMIs should fulfill the following requirements: (i)
SMIs should strongly and selectively bind to the non-growth
area, and (ii) the SMIs should have a sufficiently high surface
coverage on the non-growth area. The selective adsorption of
the candidate SMI molecules can be investigated using density
functional theory (DFT) calculations on the target growth and
non-growth areas. Thus, important information on the
adsorption energetics and the adsorption configurations of
the SMIs can be obtained. Random sequential adsorption
(RSA) simulations
29,30
can be used to estimate the coverage
and packing of inhibitor molecules as extensively discussed in
our earlier work.
31
As a consequence of vapor-phase dosing,
SMIs arrive one by one on random surface sites such that close
packing of inhibitor molecules cannot be achieved.
9
This could
be compensated by the selection of inhibitor molecules with
high enough surface coverage and dense packing to block the
incoming precursor molecules. In addition, the precursor
blocking performance of the inhibitor can be assessed using
RSA simulations as discussed in the Results and Discussion of
this manuscript.
Although the use of SMIs for area-selective ALD is a very
promising approach, finding suitable SMIs remains a
challenging task. In our previous works, acetylacetone
(Hacac, C
5
H
8
O
2
) was demonstrated as an inhibitor during
the area-selective deposition of SiO
2
using bis(diethylamino)-
silane (BDEAS) as the precursor.
26,32
It was found that the use
of the Hacac inhibitor can delay SiO
2
growth on Al
2
O
3
non-
growth areas up to 20 cycles, corresponding to about 1.5 Å
selective SiO
2
deposition on SiO
2
growth areas.
26
Both
experiments and DFT calculations showed that Hacac
molecules adsorb on an Al
2
O
3
non-growth area in a mixture
of two bonding configurations (i.e., chelate and monodentate),
whereas they cannot adsorb to the SiO
2
growth area. Among
these two adsorption configurations, the chelate configuration
was found to block BDEAS molecules successfully. However,
Hacac molecules adsorbed in monodentate configuration can
desorb during the purging step of the experiments or were
displaced during the precursor dose and caused the loss of
selectivity.
32
According to these findings, it is needed to
investigate all possible adsorption configurations of inhibitor
molecules and their effect on the inhibition layer stability. In
our recent experimental work, aniline showed promising
performance as an inhibitor during the area-selective
deposition of TiN on dielectrics as the growth area with
respect to metals as the non-growth area. Using aniline as an
inhibitor and tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) as a
Ti precursor, TiN growth was delayed for up to 100 cycles on
Co and for more than 200 cycles on Ru non-growth areas. As a
result, about 6 nm of selective TiN deposition on SiO
2
and
Al
2
O
3
was achieved.
28
In the production of nanoelectronics, various stages involve
a substrate that has been patterned with metal and dielectric
materials. In this work, the general case of having a metal as the
non-growth area is considered. We performed DFT calcu-
lations and RSA simulations to investigate the key properties
making aniline an effective SMI on metal substrates. DFT
calculations were carried out to study the adsorption
configurations and stability of aniline molecules on SiO
2
representing the dielectric growth area and on Ru and Co
surfaces representing the metal non-growth areas of a
patterned substrate. Considering the catalytic nature of the
Ru and Co surfaces, possible hydrogenolysis of aniline on these
surfaces was also included in the study. In addition, the DFT
results were used as input for the RSA simulations, as
illustrated in Figure 1, by modeling the two-dimensional (2D)
substrate and the footprint of the adsorbate molecules. Using
RSA simulations, we investigated the surface coverage and
packing of the inhibitor molecules on the non-growth areas.
The outcomes of the DFT calculations and RSA simulations
were combined to unveil how aniline effectively blocks
precursor adsorption on the non-growth area. Our results
reveal that aniline molecules adsorb on the non-growth area in
a mixture of strongly bonded configurations. This mixture

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
DFT. The Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) was used
to perform all DFT calculations reported in this study.
33−35
The
projector augmented wave (PAW) method was employed to describe
electron−ion interactions.
36,37
A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was
used for the plane-wave basis set. Calculations were performed on the
basis of the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange−correlation
functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), with the
dispersion correction D3 and the Becke−Johnson (BJ) damping
function.
38−40
The convergence criteria for structural optimizations
were set such that the total forces acting on each atom must be
smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. The convergence criterion for the self-
consistent field cycle was set to 10
−5
eV. The Brillouin zone of
crystalline Ru and Co metal bulk was integrated using an
automatically generated Γ-centered 11 × 11 × 11 k-point mesh (11
× 11 × 9 for SiO
2
), whereas a Γ-centered 2 × 2 × 1 mesh was used
for the surface calculations.
41
Gaussian smearing of 0.01 eV was used
throughout the study. Using these parameters, optimized lattice
parameters of the Ru bulk with P63/mmc space group (space group
number = 194) were found to be a = 2.70 Å and c = 4.27 Å, which are
in a good aggreement with the experimental vaues of 2.71 and 4.28 Å,
respectively.
42
Optimized lattice parameters of the Co bulk with the
same space group number were calculated as a = 2.46 Å and c = 3.99
Å and were also in a good aggreement with the experimental values of
2.50 and 4.06 Å, respectively.
43
The lattice parameters of the α-quartz
phase of SiO
2
with P3121 space group (space group number = 152)
were calculated as a = 4.80 Å and c = 5.32 Å, which were also in line
with the experimental values of a = 4.91 Å and c = 5.40 Å.
44
Ru(0001) and Co(0001) surface slabs used for the surface
calculations were modeled using a four-layer 4 × 4 supercell of the
cleaved optimized bulk structure. The metal atoms in the bottom two
layers of the surface slab were kept frozen at their bulk positions
during adsorption studies. Also, for the SiO
2
(0001) surface, a four-
layer (SiO
2
layers) surface was modeled as a 3 × 3 supercell of the
cleaved optimized SiO
2
bulk structure. As in metal surfaces, the
bottom two (SiO
2
) layers were kept frozen at their bulk positions. In
line with the previous ALD studies, the top layer of the SiO
2
(0001)
surface is fully hydroxylated.
26,45,46
Periodicity of the slab in the
direction perpendicular to the metal surface was avoided by adding a
vacuum spacing of 17 Å. At least 10 different starting configurations
were studied for the aniline adsorption on metal surfaces. In addition,
by keeping the x and y coordinates the same, the effect of the starting
distance of the aniline molecule to the surface was also tested for 2
and 3 Å, to locate possible physisorbed geometries. All of the
adsorption configurations reported for aniline were found to proceed
directly from the gas phase. In other words, no local maximas or
activated pathways were observed in the optimization calculations for
aniline adsorption on the metal surfaces. This can be attributed to the
reactive nature of metal surfaces. All resulting unique configurations
are reported here. The aniline adsorption energies were calculated
using

is the total energy of the Ru(0001) or Co(0001) slab
with adsorbed aniline at its lowest energy position on the metal
surface, E

is the total energy of a clean slab, and E
aniline
is the total
energy of the aniline molecule. The same procedure is followed for
the adsorption of the TDMAT precursor. The energies of the aniline
and TDMAT molecules were computed via spin-relaxed calculations
in 20 Å cubic cells at the gamma point.
The hydrogenolysis energy was also calculated using a formula
similar to eq 1. In this case, the total energy before the hydrogenolysis
reaction was subtracted from the total energy of the end products as
shown in

is the

molecule. Unlike the adsorption process
explained above, the hydrogenolysis reaction is not expected to
proceed spontaneously as a result of the bond cleavage and formation
of the new bonds. The kinetic analysis of this process is left for future
mechanistic studies.
RSA. A lattice RSA algorithm (see Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information) developed on the basis of our earlier work has been
adopted in this study.
31
This RSA algorithm simulates one-by-one
adsorption of inhibitor molecules on randomly selected sites on a
substrate representing the non-growth area during area-selective ALD.
The DFT-optimized lattice dimensions of Ru(0001) and Co(0001)
surfaces were used to model the substrates with periodic boundary
conditions. Both model substrates were prepared to include 5000
adsorption sites, resulting in surface areas of 318 and 273 nm
2
for the
Ru and Co surfaces, respectively. The top-down 2D projections, i.e.,
2D footprints, of aniline and benzene molecules were modeled on the
basis of the DFT-optimized adsorption configurations of molecules on
the metal non-growth areas (see Figure 1 for the procedure and
Figure S2 of the Supporting Information for other 2D footprint
models). The horizontal aniline configuration is strongly adsorbed to
the surface via the interactions of its multiple atoms with the surface,
preventing free rotation. Therefore, rotation attempts for the footprint
representing the horizontal configuration were considered on the
basis of the 6-fold symmetry of the lattice (rotational attempts of
60°). On the other hand, the vertical aniline configuration is attached
to the surface via a single bond between N and the surface metal.
Hence, it is assumed to be able to rotate freely around the M−N
bond. During the RSA iterations, the vertical aniline model was first
tested on the basis of the 6-fold symmetry (60° rotation) in random
order. Then, if it still did not fit, 1° rotation steps were tested to cover
a larger range of possible rotations. A reactive adsorption mode is also
included in the algorithm to be able to simulate aniline adsorption
with hydrogenolysis upon adsorption. When using the reactive
adsorption mode, aniline molecules adsorbed in horizontal config-
uration were converted to benzene. All RSA results reported in this
study were averaged over 20 simulations.
The RSA simulations were used to analyze the inhibitor coverage
and surface density. In addition, the gaps in the inhibitor layer (i.e.,
space not sterically covered by aniline) can be analyzed in terms of
their density and size. The effective size of these gaps has been
calculated by determining the radius of the largest circular molecule
that can be adsorbed on the unoccupied adsorption sites without an
overlap with the adsorbed inhibitor molecules (see Figure S3 of the
Supporting Information). Please also see ref 31 for more detailed
information about the RSA methodology.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selective adsorption of the inhibitor molecules on the non-
growth area is an essential step to achieve area-selective ALD
using SMIs. Therefore, we first investigated the adsorption
mechanism of aniline on the Ru(0001) and Co(0001) surfaces
representing the non-growth areas and on the SiO
2
(0001)
surface representing the growth area. The aniline molecule
strongly adsorbs with adsorption energies of −3.59 eV on Ru
and −2.17 eV on Co. Three unique thermodynamically
favorable adsorption configurations for aniline on Ru and Co
were found from DFT, as shown in Figure 2. The aniline
configuration with the most favorable adsorption energy on the
metal surfaces involves the interaction of the carbon atoms of
the aniline aromatic ring and the surface metal atoms, resulting
in a “horizontal” adsorption mode. Moreover, there is also a
“vertical” configuration for which aniline adsorbs on the
surface only through interaction between nitrogen of the amine
group and the surface metal, resulting in weaker adsorption

than the horizontal configuration. On the basis of these results,
it is expected that aniline adsorbs on the metal surfaces
through a combination of these horizontal and vertical
adsorption configurations while maximizing the horizontal
configuration, i.e., the most exothermic adsorption config-
uration.
47−49
On the SiO
2
(0001) surface representing the growth area,
two unique adsorption configurations with considerably
weaker adsorption energies were found. Aniline molecules
adsorb on the SiO
2
(0001) surface only via physical interactions
between the molecule and the surface. Even in the most
favorable adsorption configuration on SiO
2
, the adsorption
energy is only −0.57 eV. Molecules adsorbed in these two
weak physisorbed adsorption configurations are likely to
desorb in the experimental conditions and, thereby, not take
part in precursor blocking. The difference between adsorption
energetics across surfaces indicates that aniline can selectively
adsorb on the metallic non-growth areas, Co and Ru, but not
on the SiO
2
growth area, which is also in agreement with
previous experimental results.
28
These DFT analyses reveal a potential reason for why aniline
results in better precursor inhibition performance compared to,
for example, Hacac,
32
for which the presence of the mixture of
different adsorption configurations is causing selectivity loss.
For the case of aniline, both the horizontal and vertical
adsorption configurations bind strongly on the non-growth
area and are not expected to desorb during the purging step. In
addition, while the weaker (monodentate) configuration of
Hacac could provide a pathway for precursor adsorption as a
result of its exposed OH group, the phenyl group of the vertical
aniline molecules does not have an affinity toward the
precursor molecules. The phenyl group can also shield the
interaction of the (relatively more reactive) amine group of
aniline with the precursor molecules.
In addition to the selective adsorption of aniline, its ability to
block TDMAT (Ti precursor in ALD of TiN) was studied
using DFT. To this end, the adsorption of TDMAT was
studied on bare and aniline-functionalized Ru and Co surfaces
(see Figure 3). On bare surfaces, we found TDMAT
adsorption energies of −2.23 and −1.86 eV, on Ru and Co,
respectively. To study the interaction of the precursor with the
adsorbed aniline molecule, TDMAT is placed above the aniline
adsorbate optimized in previous steps (which were shown in
Figure 2). The interaction of TDMAT with the vertical aniline
configuration resulted in the transformation to the horizontal
configuration. This change of the aniline adsorption config-
uration mainly occurs as a result of repulsion interactions
between the inhibitor and precursor molecules and shows that
TDMAT is not likely to adsorb on vertical aniline. This
transition was possible because only one aniline molecule was
present on the surface in the DFT calculation. Note that such a
transition is sterically hindered on a surface saturated with
aniline molecules in both configurations. We calculated the
adsorption energy of TDMAT on surfaces with aniline in the
horizontal configuration as −0.87 and −0.90 eV on Ru and Co,
respectively. In both cases, TDMAT is physisorbed on aniline
at a distance of 2.6 Å. The lower adsorption energy of TDMAT
on the aniline-functionalized surface compared to the bare
surface confirms that the aniline inhibitor significantly reduces
the interaction of TDMAT with the non-growth area.
In our previous work, introduction of the Si precursor
bis(diethylamino)silane (BDEAS) on the Hacac-functionalized
Al
2
O
3
surface resulted in an adsorption energy of −0.81 eV on
Hacac in monodentate configuration.
32
In that case, we
observed the formation of a H bond between the free OH
group from adsorbed Hacac and the amino ligand in BDEAS,
for some orientations of the BDEAS molecule. This interaction
was described as the starting point for the displacement of the
Hacac inhibitor from the surface by the precursor, which was
experimentally observed. Interestingly, in the current analysis,
the TDMAT adsorption energy on aniline is similar to that of
BDEAS on Hacac. However, unlike the previous case, we do
not observe such a H bond that could serve as a pathway for
displacement. Although the thermodynamics of the aniline−

TDMAT interaction resembles the Hacac−BDEAS case, the
displacement kinetics are expected to be different for these two
cases, considering the significantly higher selectivity observed
for aniline in our experimental work.
28
An effective small-molecule inhibitor should have a high
enough surface coverage to be able to block the adsorption of
precursor molecules. DFT-optimized aniline geometries on Ru
and Co surface slabs, shown in panels a and b of Figure 2, were
used to determine the 2D footprints (see Figure S2 of the
Supporting Information) of the aniline molecule on a
hexagonal grid representing the Ru and Co non-growth
areas. Sample RSA outputs showing the packing of aniline
molecules on zoomed in views of the Ru and Co non-growth
area models are given in panels a and d of Figure 4. Our RSA
algorithm starts with the selection of a random surface site and
tests the adsorption of the energetically most favorable,
horizontal, configurations of aniline for each iteration of the
RSA simulations. When the horizontal configuration could not
fit, adsorption of the vertical configuration was tested on the
same adsorption site. Therefore, the aniline adsorption on both
surfaces is initially dominated by the most stable horizontal
aniline configurations. With increasing aniline exposure, we see
a transition from the thermodynamically most favorable
configuration to the sterically most favorable (i.e. the vertical)
configuration. The change of the surface density of the specific
adsorption configurations as a function of total aniline density
on the surface is plotted in panels b and e of Figure 4. At
saturation represented by black dashed lines (1.72 molecules/
nm
2
) in Figure 4b, 69 ± 1% of the aniline molecules are
present in the horizontal configuration on the Ru surface. The
same analysis on the Co surface (Figure 4e) showed that 57 ±
1% of adsorbed aniline molecules are in the horizontal
configuration, whereas the saturation surface density is 1.79
molecules/nm
2
. With the contribution of both adsorption
configurations, 60 ± 1 and 59 ± 1% of the surface area is
covered with aniline molecules on Ru and Co, respectively.
Considering that both horizontal and vertical configurations
are present on the surface in considerable quantities, both
adsorption configurations should play a significant role in the
precursor blocking observed in our experimental work.
28
The RSA simulation results were also analyzed in terms of
the sizes of the gaps in between adsorbed inhibitor molecules
after surface functionalization with aniline. The distribution of
the effective gap sizes on the non-growth area can be used to
estimate whether a precursor molecule can potentially adsorb,
as a measure for the selectivity.
31
Gap size distribution analysis
for the Ru and Co surfaces functionalized with aniline
molecules indicates that the gaps on both surfaces are mainly
concentrated below 0.35 nm, as reported in panels c and f of
Figure 4. Considering the size of a 2D-projected TDMAT
precursor molecule (∼0.49 nm, also shown as a blue dashed
line in panels c and f of Figure 4), our results suggest that the
inhibition layer is sufficiently densely packed such that there
are no surface sites available that can accommodate the
adsorption of precursor molecules. These results support that
aniline can effectively shield the adsorption sites on Ru and Co
non-growth areas and block the adsorption of the incoming
precursor molecules.
Literature on Pt, Ni, and Mo surfaces shows that, when
hydrogen is present, aniline can undergo hydrogenolysis and
dissociate into benzene and ammonia on the surface.
50−52
Given that the co-reactant in the area-selective TiN ALD
processes is an Ar−H
2
plasma,
28
it is reasonable to assume that
hydrogen is also available during the aniline dose. Because Ru
and Co are well-known catalysts, such a reaction can occur on
the non-growth areas used in this work. Thus, we also consider
the effect of hydrogenolysis on the inhibition process. Our
DFT results show that the hydrogenolysis of adsorbed aniline
is thermodynamically favorable on both metal surfaces. As

represented in Figure 5a, this process has reaction energies of
−0.89 and −0.94 eV on Ru and Co surfaces, respectively.
Ammonia and benzene are formed on the metal surfaces as a
result of the hydrogenolysis reaction. The formed ammonia
species has low adsorption energy (−1.01 eV on Ru and −0.65
eV on Co) and can potentially desorb from the surface under
the experimental conditions. Similar to aniline, the formed
benzene molecules have strong adsorption energies of −2.88
and −1.87 eV on Ru and Co, respectively, and, therefore, do
not easily desorb from the non-growth area.
A new set of RSA simulations was performed by assuming
the hydrogenolysis of all incoming aniline molecules that
adsorb in the horizontal configuration. According to these
simulations, the density of adsorbed inhibitor molecules is
increased on Ru from 1.72 to 1.99 nm
−2
and on Co from 1.79
to 1.86 nm
−2
. At saturation, 68% of the adsorbed molecules are
present as benzene on the Ru surface, while the rest of the
adsorbates were aniline in vertical configuration. For the Co
surface, the benzene fraction was calculated as 57%. As a result,
the fraction of the surface area covered is increased on the Ru
non-growth area from 60 ± 1 to 63 ± 1% and non-significantly
changed from 59 ± 1 to 57 ± 1% on the Co non-growth area.
The improvement in the surface saturation density can be
explained by the adsorption of more inhibitor molecules on the
newly available surface sites after ammonia byproduct
molecules leave the surface. As seen from panels b and c of
Figure 5, the density of the large gaps on the aniline-
functionalized surface decreases after hydrogenolysis. RSA
results, thereby, imply that hydrogenolysis is beneficial for

groups by hydrogenolysis of aniline can further help the
precursor blocking by making the inhibitor layer more
chemically inert. Hence, hydrogenolysis of adsorbed aniline
molecules can contribute to the precursor blocking on both
non-growth areas.

CONCLUSION
In this work, on the basis of experimental results for the small-
molecule inhibitor aniline, we computationally investigated
how SMIs can effectively block precursor adsorption on the
non-growth area during area-selective ALD. As the first
requirement for ASD, aniline strongly adsorbs on the non-
growth area, whereas its adsorption on the growth area is weak.
From our DFT calculations for aniline and prior results for
Hacac, it is concluded that all adsorption configurations of the
inhibitor molecule should strongly adsorb on the non-growth
area to obtain a stable inhibition layer. The case of aniline
demonstrates that the presence of multiple stable binding
configurations also results in a dense inhibitor packing, which
helps the blocking of precursor adsorption on the non-growth
area. As the surface starts to saturate, the energetically most
favorable aniline configuration cannot adsorb on the remaining
unoccupied sites. In that case, the sterically more favorable
configuration can still adsorb to the surface and enhance the
surface inhibitor density. The catalytic properties of the non-
growth area can also contribute to precursor blocking
performance. The hydrogenolysis of the adsorbed aniline
molecule is found to be thermodynamically favorable on the
studied metallic non-growth areas. Such catalytic reactions on
the non-growth area can enhance the inhibitor blocking on the
non-growth area by increasing the fraction of the surface area
covered and/or decreasing the number of available gaps on the
surface. In addition, the removal of the reactive amine groups
can eliminate the possible interactions with the precursors.
Taken together, to effectively block precursor adsorption, an
inhibitor should satisfy three main requirements: (i) all
possible adsorption configurations of an inhibitor molecule
should strongly and selectively adsorb on the non-growth area,
(ii) precursor molecules should not be able to adsorb on or
react with inhibitor molecules, and (iii) the (mixture of)
adsorption configuration(s) of the inhibitor should result in a
sufficiently high surface coverage with no gaps available for
adsorption of the incoming precursor. In addition to these, if
the inhibitor molecule reacts on the surface, the products
should satisfy these requirements to achieve effective blocking
of an incoming precursor molecule.
