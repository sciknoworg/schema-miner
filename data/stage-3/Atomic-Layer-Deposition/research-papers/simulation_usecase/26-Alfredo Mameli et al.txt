ABSTRACT: Area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD)
of ZnO was achieved on SiO2 seed layer patterns on H-
terminated silicon substrates, using diethylzinc (DEZ) as the
zinc precursor and H2O as the coreactant. The selectivity of
the ALD process was studied using in situ spectroscopic
ellipsometry and scanning electron microscopy, revealing
improved selectivity for increasing deposition temperatures
from 100 to 300°C. The selectivity was also investigated
using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were performed to corroborate the experimental
results obtained and to provide an atomic-level understanding
of the underlying surface chemistry. A kinetically hindered
proton transfer reaction from the H-terminated Si was conceived to underpin the selectivity exhibited by the ALD process. By
combining the experimental and DFT results, we suggest that the trend in selectivity with temperature may be due to a strong
DEZ or H2O physisorption on the H-terminated Si that hampers high selectivity at low deposition temperature. This work
highlights the deposition temperature as an extra process parameter to improve the selectivity.
1. INTRODUCTION
The scaling in state-of-the-art device nanofabrication requires
everﬁner patterning steps with increasing demands on feature
alignment. This scaling poses serious challenges as the features
become smaller than what can be patterned with the
conventional top-down fabrication.1 Nanopatterning involving
area-selective deposition, in particular area-selective atomic
layer deposition (ALD), has been identiﬁed as a potential
solution to aid nanoscale device manufacturing.1−4
ALD relies on the self-limiting surface reactions that take
place between surface functional groups and vapor-phase
precursors. The chemospeciﬁc nature of the technique allows
precise control of the location, where these reactions take place
by tailoring the surface chemistry. From a patterning point of
view, two main approaches for achieving area-selective ALD can
be distinguished:
(1) area deactivation, in which a part of the surface is rendered
inert toward the ALD process chemistry;5 and
(2) area activation, where conversely, an inert surface is
locally activated to enable a speciﬁc ALD chemistry.6,7
When no subtractive steps are employed, the latter approach
is referred to as direct-write ALD. 4,7−9 This speci ﬁcally
combines patterning and ALD into a bottom-up (i.e., additive)
approach.
Recently, we have demonstrated an area-selective ALD
approach for In2O3:H with micrometer-scale pattern dimen-
sions, consisting of area activation using aμ-plasma printer,
followed by thermal ALD of In2O3:H.9 This approach relies on
the long nucleation delay observed for In2O3:H ALD on H- and
NHx-terminated silicon substrate surfaces, when using an
indium cyclopentadienyl (InCp) precursor and a combination
of H2O and O2 as coreactants. Conversely, deposition takes
place almost directly on OH-terminated silicon surfaces.10 High
selectivity was demonstrated for this process, and the material
properties were shown to be similar to those of the In2O3:H
deposited on blanket silicon substrates. The high selectivity
could be attributed to the thermodynamically unfavorable
chemisorption of the precursor, InCp, on the H-terminated
surfaces.
Here, we extend the approach to another metal oxide, that is,
ZnO, which can be considered as a model system for a class of

oxides that are technologically relevant for applications in
sensing, optoelectronic, and memory devices.11−14 ZnO was
deposited using diethylzinc (DEZ) and H2O. In contrast to the
In2O3:H case, 9 here, the selectivity is attributed to the
diﬀerences in precursor reaction kinetics on growth and
nongrowth areas (NGA). Moreover, the eﬀect of the deposition
temperature has been experimentally investigated and discussed.
Finally, the area-activation step has been performed at nanoscale
dimensions which align well with the aforementioned search for
new nanopatterning approaches. The combination of the
activation step with the subsequent ALD building step is
schematically illustrated inFigure 1. In the patterning step, an
ultrathin SiO2 seed layer is locally deposited using electron
beam-induced deposition (EBID).15 In this way, nanoscale OH-
terminated regions are deﬁned that are reactive toward the ZnO
ALD chemistry, as opposed to the H-termination of the starting
surface. In the building step, ZnO is grown on the activated area
by alternating the two ALD half-reactions (pulses A and B) in a
cyclic fashion.
Because of its ability to directly deposit nanostructures with
sub-10 nm lateral dimensions without shape constraints, the
EBID technique allows to meet some of the stringent
requirements of modern and future device manufacturing in
terms of resolution.16,17 Furthermore, the EBID technique
enables deposition of materials in a direct-write (i.e., no
subtractive steps) fashion on various substrates, including
polymers.18 This unique capability makes it a suitable technique
for high-resolution bottom-up patterning of areas consisting of
diﬀerent materials having speciﬁc chemical functionalities.
In this work, the key factors that impart selectivity to the ALD
process for ZnO are discussed in terms of nucleation delay, as
measured by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The
selectivity is further elaborated on a molecular-scale level, as
corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Furthermore, the area-selective ALD was experimentally
demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
for the most illustrative sample, using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) cross-sectional inspection combined with
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy performed in the
scanning TEM mode. The eﬀect of the deposition temperature
on the selectivity (to be deﬁned inSection 3.2) between 100 and
250 °C is also studied through a combination of in situ SE and
SEM. The selectivity is found to be higher at high deposition
temperatures. A possible mechanism that may play a role in the
selectivity loss at lower temperatures will be discussed.
2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
2.1. Substrate Preparation Method.Ten nanometers-thick a-Si/
H ﬁlms were deposited on p-type c-Si(100) coupons with native oxide,
using inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICP-
CVD) from SiH4 and Ar at 50°C.
2.2. Patterning Step. After deposition of the a-Si/H starting
surfaces, the samples were quickly transferred to the SEM system. Here,
localized activation was achieved by depositing an ultrathin seed layer of
SiO2 using EBID. The sample was kept at room temperature. The
nanoscale patterns were generated in an FEI Nova 600 NanoLab
DualBeam SEM system. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as
the Si-precursor, together with H2O to generate SiO2 (with ∼26 at. % C
impurities) patterns. Both gases were simultaneously introduced into
the SEM chamber through a gas injection system at a pressure of 2.5×
10−5 mbar. The SiO2 nanoscale patterns were generated by scanning an
electron beam with 2, 5, 10, 15, or 30 kV acceleration voltages and
currents between∼0.04 and∼0.14 nA. The volume per dose (i.e., the
yield of SiO2 EBID) was calculated for both 5 and 30 kV by depositing
test structures and by determining their volume using SEM.
The calculated values were used to select settings for deposition of
SiO2 seed layers as thin as∼1 nm for all of the accelerating voltages
described above. The best spatial resolution of the seed layer was
obtained for an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a current of 0.14 nA.
These settings were therefore used in this work. Right after the
patterning step, the samples were transferred to the ALD reactor. The
transfer was done within a few minutes in order to minimize possible
oxidation and degradation of the H-termination of nontreated surface
of the substrate because of the exposure to the ambient atmosphere.
2.3. ALD Process. For this study, a commercial ALD reactor
(OPAL, Oxford Instruments) was used for depositing ZnO. DEZ
[Zn(C2H5)2] was employed as the zinc precursor and H2O as the
coreactant. A standard recipe was employed, for which the details can
be found elsewhere.19 The patterned ZnO samples described in this
study were prepared using 80 ALD cycles at temperatures ranging from
100 to 250°C (for completeness, the ZnO growth rate as a function of
the deposition temperature is reported in theSupporting Information,
Figure S1). The chamber pressure during the ALD process was∼170
mTorr during the 50 ms DEZ pulses (A) and the Ar purges, with a spike
of 250 mTorr during the 100 ms H2O pulses (B).
2.4. Analytical Methods. Nucleation studies were carried out
using in situ SE, performed with a J.A. Woollam M2000D ellipsometer.
Morphology and surface coverage analyses of the ZnO structures
prepared by area-selective ALD were carried out in an FEI Nova 600
Nanolab DualBeam SEM system using 10 kV and 0.54 nA. The same
SEM system was used to prepare a cross-sectional lamella by means of
focused ion beam milling. Before the lamella preparation, a protective
layer of Al2O3 was deposited by thermal ALD using trimethylaluminum
[TMA, Al(CH 3)3]a n dH 2Oa st h ep r e c u r s o ra n dc o r e a c t a n t ,
respectively. Cross-sectional TEM studies were performed in high-
angle annular dark-ﬁeld (HAADF) scanning mode STEM and in
bright-ﬁeld TEM modes using a probe-corrected TEM system (JEOL
JEM ARM 200F) equipped with a 100 mm2 Centurio SDD EDX
spectroscopy detector for chemical analysis. TEM studies were
employed to assess the selectivity of the process.20−22
2.5. DFT Methods. All electronic structure calculations were
performed using the projector-augmented wave function 23,24 as
implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, VASP
v.5.3.5.25−27 First-principles calculations were carried out using the
generalized gradient approximation to the DFT.28,29 The Perdew−
Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) 30 exchange correlation functional was
employed with the Van der Waals interactions included on an empirical
basis (PBE-D3). 31 Hydroxylated α-SiO2 clusters were used as
approximations of the EBID SiO2 seed layers and c-Si with native
oxide utilized in the experiments. Accordingly, H-terminated c-Si
clusters were employed as approximations of the a-Si/H used in the
Figure 1.Schematic representation of the area-selective ALD approach
of ZnO on an H-terminated amorphous Si layer. First, nanoscale
patterns are deﬁned by depositing a SiO2 seed layer using EBID
(patterning step 1). Next, ZnO is deposited selectively on the activated
areas (i.e., SiO2 seed layer patterns) by area-selective ALD (building
step 2). This ALD process consists of cycles of two alternating half-
reactions: precursor dosing in pulse A and coreactant dosing in pulse B.

experiments.9 These simulation models ofα-SiO2 and H-terminated c-
Si surfaces have been utilized for studying the precursor adsorption step
in similar ALD processes.9,10,32 Minimum energy pathways for the
chemisorption of a DEZ precursor molecule on each surface were
computed using the climbing-image nudge elastic band method,33 as
implemented in VASP-VTST tools.34 The same method was used to
study the chemisorption of an H2O molecule on an H-terminated c-Si
surface. Further details on model preparations and computations can be
found in our previous reports.9,10 Binding energies of DEZ or H2Oo n
various silicon surfaces through physisorption or chemisorption
(ΔEp/c) were evaluated usingeq 1.
Δ=− −EE E Ep/c PS P S (1)
where EPS is the total energy of the physisorbed/chemisorbed
substrate−precursor complex andEP and ES are the total energies of
an isolated DEZ (or H2O) molecule and a given substrate surface,
respectively. Here, physisorption can be described as the weak physical
(noncovalent) binding of the DEZ (or H2O) molecule on a given
surface, whereas the chemisorption requires the chemical (covalent)
bonding of the precursor (or the coreactant), accompanied by the loss
of one of the ligands.
Gibbs free-energy changes (ΔG = Δ(Eelec + EZPE) − TΔS) associated
with DEZ adsorption were estimated in the ideal gas limit at the typical
ALD conditions (T =5 0−400 °C andp = 100 mTorr), accounting for
the translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions to the
enthalpy and entropy terms (see the eﬀect of temperature on the
reaction energetics in the Supporting Information). All-atom vibra-
tional analyses were performed using the dynamical matrix method
(based onﬁnite diﬀerences) implemented in VTST tools.34
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. ALD of ZnO: Nucleation on SiO2 and a-Si/H.Figure
2 shows the ZnOﬁlm thickness as a function of the number of
ALD cycles, as measured by in situ SE, for a deposition
temperature of 100°C. The nucleation behavior was measured
on a freshly deposited∼10 nm a-Si/Hﬁlm and on c-Si coupons
with native oxide (hereinafter referred to as SiO2), which can be
considered as representative for the SiO2 EBID seed layers. A
relatively long nucleation delay of∼80 cycles was observed on
the a-Si/H substrate. After a transient regime,35 linear growth
starts with a growth per cycle (GPC) of ∼1.6 Å/cycle. In
contrast, a very short nucleation delay is observed on SiO2
before theﬁlm growth becomes linear with a GPC of∼1.6 Å/
cycle.
The results ofFigure 2represent aﬁrst indication that area-
selective ALD of ZnO can be obtained by exploiting the
diﬀerence in nucleation delays on the two surfaces. Furthermore,
the nucleation curves suggest a selectivity window (expressed as
the number of ALD cycles for which no deposition is obtained
on the a-Si/H) of about 80 ALD cycles before deposition occurs
on both surfaces and the selectivity is lost.
The key reason for the diﬀerence in nucleation delay lies in the
surface chemistry because dissimilar surface groups have distinct
kinetic barriers toward various thermodynamically favorable end
states. Two reaction pathways were proposed to investigate the
chemisorption of DEZ on the diﬀe r e n ts u r f a c e sf r o ma
theoretical point of view. Using DFT, activation and
chemisorption energies were calculated for the following
reactions
−* + → − − * +Si H Zn(C H ) Si Zn C H C H25 2 25 26
(2a)
−* + → − − * +Si O H Z n ( CH) S i O Z n CH CH25 2 25 26
(2b)
where the asterisks indicate the relevant surface groups.
DFT calculations indicate that the physisorption of DEZ on
both surfaces is exothermic with similar energy gains (ΔEp =
−0.37 vs−0.34 eV, see theSupporting Information, Figure S2).
Figure 3 shows the corresponding DFT-based energy proﬁles
connecting the physisorbed and chemisorbed species given in
reactions2a and 2b. Both reactions are thermodynamically
favored, with chemisorption energies of−0.98 and −1.25 eV.
However, an activation energy of 1.16 eV was calculated for
reaction2a and 0.81 eV for reaction2b. The diﬀerence in energy
barriers points toward a kinetically hindered surface reaction in
the case of DEZ on an H-terminated surface. This may explain
the diﬀerence in nucleation delay observed in Figure 2 .
Assuming the pre-exponential factors in the Arrhenius equation
to be similar in magnitude for the two reactions, at 100°C, the
diﬀerence in kinetic barrier translates into a rate constant 5.4×
104 times higher on SiO2 than on a-Si/H.
Because either DEZ or H2O surface reactions can play a role
in the loss of selectivity after a prolonged number of ALD cycles
(as shown inFigure 2), the reaction energetics of the coreactant
with the H-terminated c-Si was also investigated (see the
Supporting Information, Figure S3). The H2O exposure might
cause uncontrolled surface activation through parasitic
oxidation reactions of the a-Si/H.Figure S3 shows the
corresponding DFT energy pro ﬁle. The oxidation of H-
terminated surface by H2O was found to be a slower process
(with an activation energy of 1.49 eV), as compared to the DEZ
chemisorption (reaction2a). These ﬁndings are in agreement
with the well-known stability of H-terminated surfaces toward
mild oxidants.36−38 On the basis of these considerations and
neglecting other possible eﬀects that in reality may aﬀect the
deposition process (e.g., presence of multiple reaction pathways,
surface defects, or impurities), the DFT results suggest that
reaction 2a forms the limiting step eventually leading to
selectivity loss and therefore to the nucleation of ZnO on a-
Si/H.
3.2. Selectivity at 100°C. To demonstrate the feasibility of
the area-selective ALD method, ALD was performed to deposit
ZnO on 500× 500 nm2 SiO2 EBID patterns that were created on
a ∼10 nm a-Si/H-coated substrate.Figure 4a,c shows 35 SiO2
Figure 2.ZnO ﬁlm thickness measured by in situ SE as a function of the
number of ALD cycles performed on substrates with a native SiO2
surface (closed squares) and with a∼10 nm-thick a-Si/H layer (open
squares). On SiO2, the ZnOﬁlm thickness increases linearly after a
short delay of a few cycles, whereas on a-Si/H, the ZnO deposition
experiences a relatively long nucleation delay. Only after 80 ALD cycles,
the growth also starts on the a-Si/H and enters a linear regime at about
120 cycles. Both depositions were carried out at 100°C.

EBID patterns before and after 80 ALD cycles of ZnO at a
deposition temperature of 100°C. ZnO deposition occurred
predominantly on the SiO2 EBID patterns, although some ZnO
nucleation was observed outside the patterns, as will be
discussed below.
The selectivity,S, was deﬁned by Gladfelter in theﬁeld of area-
selective CVD as39
= −
+ ≤≤S NN
NN Swith 0 1GA NGA
GA NGA (3)
Here, NGA is the amount of material deposited (i.e., in terms of
thickness, atomic areal density, coverage, etc.) on the surface on
which growth should take place, referred to as the growth area
(GA).NNGA is the amount of material on the surface on which
growth should be inhibited, referred to as the NGA. We note
that area-normalized measurements should be considered when
calculating the selectivity. By deﬁnition, S = 1 for perfectly
selective processes andS = 0 for nonselective processes. When
adopting this deﬁnition, S is dependent on the number of ALD
cycles because deposition on the NGA can start after a
nucleation delay.
Using the deﬁnition above, the selectivity of the ZnO ALD
process was calculated using the thickness as measured by the SE
data shown inFigure 2and the coverage as imaged by the SEM
in Figure 4d. After 80 ALD cycles of ZnO at a deposition
temperature of 100°C, the selectivity was measured to be 0.96
by SE and 0.83 by SEM. This diﬀerence in selectivity indicates
that the SE data can overestimate the selectivity, which might be
due to optical modeling as well as to the diﬃculties in modeling a
noncontinuous ﬁlm. Nevertheless, SE provides a good ﬁrst
indication of the selectivity and of its changes with the number of
ALD cycles. These aspects will be elaborated more in detail
below. Furthermore, it should be noted that the EBID-grown
SiO2 and the c-Si native oxide may also behave diﬀerently
because of a high concentration of carbon impurities (∼26 at. %)
that was measured for the SiO2 deposited by EBID (see the
Supporting Information, Figure S4).40,41 Besides OH groups
that will obviously be present on a SiO2 surface, it has been
suggested that electron irradiation of the TEOS ligands can lead
to the formation of Si−C and Si−CH3 and Si−H bonds.42 The
presence of these surface groups can inhibit DEZ adsorption,
which can explain the slight diﬀerence in thickness and
morphology that were observed between the ZnO deposited
on EBID SiO2 and native SiO2. In addition, the thinner SiO2
EBID patterns may also not form a completely closedﬁlm.
Optimization of the EBID patterning step may further improve
the process.
3.3. E ﬀect of the Deposition Temperature on
Selectivity. The temperature dependence of the selectivity
was assessed by in situ SE measurements and further
corroborated by SEM inspections. This dependence can provide
additional insights into the mechanisms leading to selectivity
loss after a certain number of ALD cycles.Figure 5a shows the
evolution of the ZnO thickness as a function of the number of
ALD cycles on blanket SiO2 and a-Si/H samples for deposition
temperatures of 100 and 250°C. A larger nucleation delay is
observed for deposition at 250 °C. Figure 5b shows the
corresponding selectivity as a function of the number of ALD
cycles, for 100 and 250°C. The selectivity was calculated by
combining the datasets shown inFigure 5a. For a deposition
temperature of 100°C, the selectivity decreases from 1.0 to 0.96
at 80 ALD cycles. By further increasing the number of cycles, the
selectivity drops to 0.85 (at 100 cycles), which corresponds to a
ZnO thickness of∼1 nm on the NGA. For a deposition
temperature of 250°C, the selectivity,S, remains 1 until 110
cycles and then decreases to 0.95 at 140 ALD cycles.
These results clearly show an important aspect concerning the
selectivity of this process: the selectivity window can be
extended by increasing the deposition temperature but by
staying below 350°C. At a deposition temperature of 350°C,

the selectivity is abruptly lost (see theSupporting Information,
Figure S5). According to the idealized kinetic model described
earlier using DFT calculations, one would expect the selectivity
to increase with decreasing temperature because the chem-
isorption of DEZ on the H-terminated Si surface would be an
even slower process. Indeed, the calculated Gibbs free energy for
theﬁnal products and for the transition state (Figures S6 and S7)
predicts larger selectivity at low temperature.
In contrast, the experimental results demonstrate that
selectivity increases with the deposition temperature, thereby
highlighting that several other factors (such as physisorption)
may play a role in causing selectivity loss, as discussed below.
To further investigate the eﬀect of the temperature, the
selectivity was measured for diﬀerent deposition temperatures
between 100 and 250°C, while keeping the number of ALD
cycles ﬁxed at 80. In this case, the selectivity was calculated using
the ZnO surface coverage in and outside the patterned area, as
measured by top-view SEM.Figure 6shows the selectivity after
80 ALD cycles as a function of the deposition temperature,
together with the SEM top-view images of the patterns
deposited at 100, 150, and 250°C as insets. The selectivity
increases from 0.83 (at 100°C) to 0.97 (at 150°C) and 0.99 (at
200 and 250°C). In other words, the SEM-measured selectivity
data conﬁrmed the results obtained using SE: the selectivity
increases with the deposition temperature up to 250°C. In order
to explain the decrease in selectivity for low deposition
temperature, a statistical analysis of the density of ZnO islands
was conducted on several 500× 500 nm2 areas of the a-Si/H
substrate. The data shown inFigure 7reveal that, for the same
number of cycles, the density of ZnO islands is one order of
magnitude larger at 100°C, compared to the one at 250°C. The
higher density of nucleation at 100°C seems consistent with
undesired reactions with physisorbed precursor or coreactant
molecules on the NGA. Because the rate of desorption of
physisorbed species decreases with decreasing the deposition
temperature (for details see theSupporting Information, Figure
S8), such physisorbed species may act as spurious nucleation
sites and eﬀectively decrease the selectivity of the process at low
deposition temperatures.
A similar phenomenon has been observed for the ALD of
Al2O3 on graphene: lower deposition temperatures resulted in
higher Al 2O3 coverage on a chemically inert graphene
substrate.43 Furthermore, Seo et al., using self-assembled
monolayers (SAM) as NGA and titanium as the GA, argued
that the selectivity for Al2O3 ALD is hampered because of the
physisorption of TMA on the SAM.44 The selectivity of their
process could be increased by using lower partial pressures of
precursor and by increasing the purge step in order to suppress
this physisorption.

Here, we suggest that a balance exists between the desorption
rate of physisorbed species which may cause unwanted
nucleation and the chemisorption rate on the NGA. Therefore,
by tuning the deposition temperature, the rate of desorption and
chemisorption can be altered and an optimum in selectivity was
found between 250 and 300°C, before the selectivity is
completely lost at 350°C. For a more detailed discussion and
the complete set of nucleation curves from 100 to 350°C, see
the Supporting Information, Figure S5. Such an abrupt loss in
selectivity is probably due to oxidation of the nongrowth surface
or fast enough reaction kinetics with the DEZ. The DFT-
calculated Gibbs free energies for the transition states suggest
that the reason for the selectivity loss at 350°C is indeed linked
to the kinetics of the reactions because at about that temperature
the two rates are equal. This observation strengthens further the
idea that the selectivity of this speciﬁc process is under kinetic
control.
3.4. Cross-Sectional TEM Analysis of Selectivity.Area-
selective deposition was further investigated by cross-sectional
TEM analysis of a pattern similar to those shown in the insets of
Figure 6. Figure 8a shows an HAADF-STEM cross-sectional
image of a∼1 nm-thick SiO2 EBID layer with a∼7 nm-thick
ZnO layer deposited by area-selective ALD using 80 ALD cycles
at a deposition temperature of 250°C. In Figure 8a,b, low-
magniﬁcation images clearly show that ZnO deposition took
place only on the activated area, that is, the SiO2 seed layer. To
further prove this, high-magniﬁcation images were taken from
the central area of the pattern and from the region 250 nm away
from this area (Figure 8c,d). Figure 8e,f presents the EDX
elemental mappings of the pattern shown in the corresponding
TEM images, which conﬁrm the presence of Zn on the activated
area. No Zn could be detected in the regions outside the SiO2
EBID pattern, clearly demonstrating the selectivity of the ALD
process.
4. CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrated a bottom-up patterning process at the
nanoscale involving area-selective ALD of ZnO with a high
selectivity on SiO2 with respect to H-terminated Si. This process
exploits the direct-write patterning capabilities of EBID to
locally activate H-terminated surfaces by the deposition of SiO2
seed layers.
Considering a defect-free H-terminated c-Si surface model,
the energetics of the surface reactions were calculated by DFT
methods. The results from DFT simulations suggest that the
selectivity originates from a kinetically limited surface reaction
between the DEZ precursor and an H-terminated Si surface,
when compared to a similar reaction on an OH-terminated SiO2
surface. Experimentally, we observed that increasing the
deposition temperature plays a signiﬁcant role in improving
the selectivity of the process.
On the basis of these results, it can be inferred that at aﬁxed
deposition temperature, the limiting step that causes selectivity
loss is the DEZ precursor chemisorption on the H-terminated Si
surface. We suggest that the low selectivity at low deposition
temperature is due to strong physisorption of DEZ or H2O that
can contribute in hampering otherwise high selectivity through
parasitic reactions. Our results indicate that several physico-
chemical mechanisms (reaction kinetics, physisorption, etc.)
can play opposite roles in determining the selectivity and
detailed investigation of the surface chemistry at diﬀerent
temperatures is required to ﬁnd the optimum deposition
conditions for achieving high selectivity. Improving further the
selectivity in area-selective ALD therefore remains a challenging
problem and novel strategies to limit or counteract selectivity
loss pathways are needed. We believe that the insights obtained
in this work will expand the understanding of the mechanisms
involved in area-selective ALD and in selectivity loss.

Figure 8.(a,b) Cross-sectional TEM images of a ZnO thinﬁlm that was
selectively deposited (using 80 ALD cycles at 250°C) on a∼1 nm thick
SiO2 EBID pattern with a width of∼500 nm. Low-magniﬁcation images
show a pristine NGA outside the patterned GA, indicating that no ZnO
deposition occurred on these surfaces. (c) High-magniﬁcation images
showing the patterned GA and (d) region 250 nm away from the
pattern, conﬁrming the selectivity of the process. (e,f) EDX elemental
mappings of the same pattern at two diﬀerent magniﬁcations also show
the presence of ZnO on the SiO2 GA and the absence of ZnO on the a-
Si/H NGA.
