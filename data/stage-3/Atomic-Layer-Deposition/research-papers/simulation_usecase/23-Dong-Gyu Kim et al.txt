ABSTRACT: Achieving high mobility and reliability in atomic
layer deposition (ALD)-based IGZO thin-film transistors (TFTs)
with an amorphous phase is vital for practical applications in
relevant fields. Here, we suggest a method to effectively increase
stability while maintaining high mobility by employing the
selective application of nitrous oxide plasma reactant during
plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) at 200 °C process temperature.
The nitrogen-doping mechanism is highly dependent on the
intrinsic carbon impurities or nature of each cation, as
demonstrated by a combination of theoretical and experimental
research. The Ga
2
O
3
subgap states are especially dependent on
plasma reactants. Based on these insights, we can obtain high-
performance indium-rich PEALD-IGZO TFTs (threshold voltage:
−0.47 V; field-effect mobility: 106.5 cm
2
/(V s); subthreshold swing: 113.5 mV/decade; hysteresis: 0.05 V). In addition, the device
shows minimal threshold voltage shifts of +0.45 and −0.10 V under harsh positive/negative bias temperature stress environments
(field stress: ±2 MV/cm; temperature stress: 95 °C) after 10000 s.

INTRODUCTION
The semiconductor industry is expanding toward artificial
intelligence (AI), cloud data centers, and high-bandwidth
memory processing in memory (HBM-PIM).
1,2
The design of
high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) with low-
voltage operation, high field-effect mobility (μ
FE
), and low
leakage current has propelled the development of relevant
fields. Oxide-based thin-film transistors (TFTs) are garnering
increased attention owing to their steep subthreshold swing
(SS) and extremely low leakage current.
3,4
Although oxide-
based TFTs are known to restrict μ
FE
(∼30 cm
2
/(V s)),
numerous research groups have demonstrated exceptional μ
FE
values exceeding 100 cm
2
/(V s).
5,6
The high stability of oxide-based TFTs is another
prerequisite for their widespread application. Many groups
have reported that the gate insulator (GI) plays a crucial role in
determining the device stability. One crucial factor to consider
is the band offset between the GI and oxide semiconductor, as
it determines the energy barrier for charge carriers to move
across the interface.
7,8
Moreover, because the GI is deposited
on the active layer in the top gate structure, the stability of
oxide semiconductors is highly dependent on the GI process
parameters.
9−11
Therefore, selecting appropriate GI materials
and optimizing the process parameters of the GI deposition are
necessary to ensure high stability. However, achieving high
mobility and stability is challenging, as the overall properties of
oxide-based TFTs are compromised. Typically, the electron
mobility of oxide semiconductors (e.g., IGZO) is an apparent
function of the indium cation content. The spherical 5s orbitals
of indium ions generate an overlapped orbital string, increasing
the IGZO band dispersion.
3,4,12,13
However, the oxygen
vacancy (V
O
) concentration increases proportionally with
indium content because the dissociation energy of the
indium−oxygen (3.6 ± 0.3 eV) is lower than gallium−oxygen
(3.9 ± 0.2 eV).
14
Despite the high mobility of indium-rich
IGZO TFTs, the increased V
O
eventually destabilizes IGZO
TFTs.
Crystalline IGZO TFTs, such as c-axis alignment crystalline
(CAAC) and spinel phases, have been proposed for trade-off
relaxation between the mobility and stability of oxide-based
TFTs.
15−18
However, synthesizing a crystalline oxide semi-
conductor with large-area uniformity is technically challenging.

resolve the issue of uniformity. Previous studies have
confirmed that nitrogen (N) doping is promising for regulating
V
O
defect concentration.
11,19−21
Because the atomic radius of
N is comparable to that of oxygen (O), doped N is a suitable
replacement for V
O
defect sites. Moreover, conventional
physical vapor deposition (PVD) is already employed for
high-volume manufacturing (HVM). However, limited cation
controllability and an unstable chemical bonding status with
anions make it challenging to achieve the device performance
requirements in emerging applications. In contrast, atomic
layer deposition (ALD) is an indispensable alternative capable
of independently adjusting cation and anion concentrations
based on repeated deposition cycles with various reac-
tants.
22−24
In other words, the ALD can easily determine an
anion doping concentration for each element in the multi-
component oxide semiconductors by changing a reactant
species.
We fabricated high-mobility IGZO TFTs capable of low-
voltage operation using plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD), and
the properties of previously reported ALD-IGZO TFTs with
high-mobility (<50 cm
2
/(V s)) are summarized in Table
S1.
25−30
Though the PEALD-synthesized IGZO channel layer
is amorphous, an appropriate N-doping strategy coupled with
PEALD can alleviate stability and uniformity issues. In this
study, a nitrous oxide (N
2
O) plasma reactant was applied
selectively during each ALD cation cycle. Our strategy here,
the N
2
O plasma reactant, is completely different from plasma
treatment in that it participates in chemical reactions during
the ALD process. There have been several reports on the
application of N
2
O plasma reactant for insulation materials
(SiO
2
, Al
2
O
3
, HfO
2
, and ZrO
2
) or ZnO during PEALD,
whereas IGZO multicomponent oxide semiconductor has yet
to be reported clearly.
11,31−34
Using a combinatorial study of
experimental analysis and theoretical interpretation, we
investigated the N-doping mechanism, and the associated
enhancements in performance and stability of PEALD-
synthesized IGZO TFTs were investigated. Our results provide
insights into the atomic precision optimization of the
performance and stability of IGZO TFTs.

× 6 in. scale utilizing a lateral-flow-type PEALD system with a radio
frequency (13.56 MHz) direct capacitance coupled plasma source
(ISAC Research Inc.). The substrate temperature, working pressure,
and plasma power were fixed at 200 °C, 1.2 Torr, and 100 W,
respectively. During deposition, argon (Ar) (99.999%) gas was
employed as the carrier gas. For In

, Ga

O

, and ZnO deposition,
(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)dimethylindium (DADI), trimethylgal-
lium (TMGa), and diethylzinc (DEZ) precursors were utilized. For
appropriate vapor pressure, the DADI canister temperature was
increased to 45 °C, whereas the TMGa was cooled to 15 °C.
Additionally, the DADI precursor was delivered to a reaction chamber
assisted by Ar carrier gas. To oxidize the above precursors, we utilized
an aqueous O
2
or N
2
O plasma diluted in Ar at a 1:1 ratio as the
reactant. The O
2
and N
2
O gas lines are designed to be spatially
separate to minimize intermixing of the plasma species. The PEALD
process steps and cycle time for these thin films are as follows:
precursor dose (DADI: 1.5 s; TMGa: 0.1 s; DEZ: 0.3 s)−purge (Ar:

PEALD-IGZO TFTs Fabrication. Top-gate bottom-contact (TG-
BC) PEALD-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on a thermally grown 100
nm thick SiO
2
buffer layer. For the source and drain electrodes, a 100
nm thick ITO layer was deposited using RF sputtering and patterned
employing a conventional photolithography process. Next, a 10 nm
thick reference and controlled IGZO layer deposited using PEALD
was utilized as the active layer and defined by photolithography,
followed by a wet etching process. As a GI, a 20 nm thick Al
2
O
3
layer
was deposited using PEALD, and the contact holes for the source/
drain were opened. Based on the dielectric constant of PEALD-Al
2
O
3
(8.05), the equivalent oxide thickness (E
OT
) of the 20 nm thick Al
2
O
3
layer was calculated as ∼10 nm. To fabricate the gate electrode, a 100
nm thick ITO layer was deposited and patterned employing a
conventional photolithography process. The width and length of the
IGZO TFTs were 40 and 20 μm, respectively. Finally, the fabricated
devices were processed postannealing at 350 °C for 3 h under dry air
(O
2
21%/N
2
79%; purity: 99.999%) in ambient conditions.
Characterization. The electrical characteristics of the devices
were measured in a dark vacuum environment at 350 mTorr by using
a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer. In addition,
the electrical properties of thin films, such as the carrier concentration
and resistivity, were characterized by using Hall measurements
(HMS-3000, Ecopia). The cation atomic composition of the IGZO
films was obtained using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry (ED-XRF, ARL QUANT’X, Thermo Scientific). The
chemical bond states were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha+, Thermo Scientific) employing a
monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source with a pass energy of 50
eV. Crystallinity was evaluated by employing grazing incidence X-ray
diffraction (GI-XRD, SmartLab, Rigaku) with a Cu Kα (1.5405 Å)
target. The surface morphology images and surface roughness of the
IGZO films were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-80,
Park Systems). The amounts of quantitative N, CO, and CO
2
species
were observed using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS,
TDS1200, ESCO) from 36 to 600 °C at a rate of 60 °C/min
under a high vacuum of 1 × 10
−8
Pa. The thickness, subgap states
near the conduction band minimum (CBM), and optical bandgap of
the thin films were measured by employing spectroscopic ellipsometry
(SE, M-2000, WizOptics).
First-Principles Calculations. Spin-polarized density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed by employing the Vienna
ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.
35,36
The Perdew−Burke−
Ernzerh (PBE) functional was applied to estimate the exchange-
correlation energy of the Kohn−Sham equation.
37
The DFT-D3
method using the Becke−Johnson damping model was employed to
appropriately include the van der Waals interaction.
38
The interaction
between the ionic core and valence electrons was described utilizing
the projector-augmented wave method.
39
The valence electron wave
functions were expanded on a plane-wave basis up to an energy cutoff
of 400 eV. The Hubbard-U correction method with a U
eff
of 7 eV was
applied to effectively treat the localized d-orbitals of In and Ga.
40−43
The Brillouin zone was sampled at the Γ-point for all calculations.
The convergence criteria for the electronic structure and atomic
geometries are 10
−4
and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. To improve the state
convergence near the Fermi level, a Gaussian smearing function with a
finite temperature width of 0.05 eV was utilized. To describe the
atomic structure of the ALD-synthesized films, 2 × 2 × 4 In

O

(111),
3 × 2 × 5 β-Ga
2
O
3
(010), and 5 × 5 × 4 ZnO (101) slab models were
employed (Figure 6a). A 15 Å vacuum layer was applied to avoid
interactions between the periodic supercells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Impact of N
2
O Plasma Reactant on the Electrical
Characteristics of PEALD-IGZO TFTs. PEALD-IGZO active
layers were deposited on the buffer layer utilizing a supercycle
method consisting of In
2
O
3
, Ga
2
O
3
, and ZnO, as depicted in
Figure 1a. To clarify the effect of the plasma reactant species
on the TFT characteristics, IGZO active layers were deposited
using O
2
and N
2
O plasma reactants, as shown in Figure 1b.
Here, the plasma reactants are completely different from
plasma treatment in that they participate in chemical reactions
during the ALD process. As shown in Figure 1c, we fabricated
TG-BC PEALD-IGZO TFTs using a conventional photo-
lithography process, and it was also confirmed that the TFT
arrays were well separated. Figure 2 shows the transfer
characteristics of the PEALD-IGZO TFTs using the O
2
and
N
2
O plasma reactants, and the device key parameters are
summarized in Table S2. The IGZO TFT with an O
2
plasma
reactant exhibits an outstanding μ
FE
of 135.8 ± 4.1 cm
2
/(V s),
whereas it significantly deteriorates from 85.0 ± 4.4 to 23.6 ±
0.2 cm
2
/(V s) when the N
2
O plasma reactant time increases
from 1 to 5 s. Furthermore, the N
2
O plasma time results in
increased SS and hysteresis with a positive threshold voltage
(V
TH
) shift. Figure 2b illustrates the positive bias temperature
stress (PBTS) stability results at 95 °C for 10000 s with a gate
field stress of 2 MV/cm. The IGZO TFTs with the N
2
O
plasma reactant demonstrated poorer stability than those with
the O
2
plasma reactant. These inferior electrical characteristics
of the N
2
O plasma reactant were investigated by using XPS.
Figure 2 depicts the XPS O 1s and N 1s peaks of the IGZO
thin films. Compared with the O
2
plasma reactant, the oxygen
deficiency (O
def
) peak decreased from 22.5 to 19.9% with
increasing N
2
O plasma time. Considering the increase in N
content up to 0.2 at. % within the N
2
O plasma time of 5 s, the
decrease in O
def
could be ascribed to the N-doping effect, as
described in the literature.
11,19−21
Typically, N doping in
IGZO can contribute to decreasing oxygen-related defects
because its atomic radius is comparable to that of O and N.
Therefore, many research groups have demonstrated promis-
ing device stability using N doping in sputtering-derived
IGZO, which generally possesses an atomic composition of
In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1 at. %. Because indium-rich IGZO (Table S3)
was deposited using the PEALD process herein, the puzzling
poor stability of the N
2
O plasma reactant implies the
dependency of N doping effects on the IGZO cation
composition. Considering these results, indium, gallium, and
zinc cations were hypothesized to exhibit different tendencies
in the N
2
O plasma reactant effects.
Selective N
2
O Plasma Reactant Application for Each
Cation Element of PEALD-IGZO. To gain insight into the
N
2
O plasma reactant effects for each cation in IGZO, we
fabricated three splits of IGZO films for the active channel
layer. As depicted in Figure 3a, the IGZO films were deposited
considering the O
2
plasma reactant, whereas indium, gallium,
and zinc subcycles were selectively applied to the N
2
O plasma
reactant (∗ means N
2
O plasma reactant, denoted by I*GZO,
IG*ZO, and IGZ*O, hereafter). The difference in cation
atomic composition of the three splits of IGZO films is
negligible, as shown in Figure S1 and Table S4. Figure 3
illustrates the transfer characteristics of the I*GZO, IG*ZO,
and IGZ*O TFTs. The black dots indicate the reference IGZO
TFT deposited using an O
2
plasma time of 1 s, whereas the red
and blue dots represent IGZO TFTs with selective N
2
O
plasma times of 1 and 5 s for each cation, respectively. The
electrical parameters, such as V
TH
, μ
FE
, SS, and hysteresis,
extracted from the transfer characteristics are presented in
Table 1. To more clearly identify the effect of N
2
O plasma
reactant on electrical characteristics, the μ
FE
values of I*GZO,
IG*ZO, and IGZ*O TFTs as a function of gate voltages are

compared in Figures 3e, 3f, and 3g, respectively. The μ
FE
and
SS values degraded with a positive V
TH
shift with an increasing
N
2
O plasma time for each cation material. However, the
variations in the electrical parameters were slightly different
depending on the cation type. In particular, the I*GZO TFTs
exhibited a significant decrease in μ
FE
(135.8 → 23.2 cm
2
/(V
s)) with an increasing N
2
O plasma time. However, the N
2
O
plasma effects on Ga
2
O
3
in IG*ZO TFTs were insignificant
compared with those of In
2
O
3
. Among the electrical
parameters, the N
2
O plasma for Ga
2
O
3
produces IG*ZO
TFTs with a positive V
TH
shift (−1.41 → −0.47 V).
Furthermore, a large increment of SS (72.3 → 145.1 mV/
decade) in the IGZ*O TFTs was observed. Based on these
experimental results, the N
2
O plasma reactants for In
2
O
3
,
Ga
2
O
3
, and ZnO in the IGZO system could possibly serve as
mobility suppressors, V
TH
stabilizers, and slope destroyers,
respectively. To identify the unique characteristics of the N
2
O
plasma reactant for each cation in the IGZO TFTs, GI-XRD
was performed, as depicted in Figure S2. Because the selective
N
2
O plasma IGZO active layers exhibited an amorphous
phase, the relationship between the electrical characteristics
and crystallinity was not considered. During device fabrication,
the only difference between the reference and selective N
2
O
plasma IGZO TFTs was the plasma reactant species for each
cation material. Therefore, focusing on each cationic material
could reasonably explain these results with precision.

investigated via Hall measurements. However, because of the

carrier concentration, only the electrical character-
istics of the In

and ZnO thin films could be obtained, as
depicted in Figures S3a and S3b, respectively. The In

ZnO films exhibited a decrease in carrier concentration and
increased resistivity with the N

O
is an
important factor in determining carrier concentration and
resistivity in oxide semiconductors.

Therefore, XPS
analysis of each cation material was performed to evaluate the
effects of the N

characteristics. Figure 4 illustrates a comparison of the XPS

deconvoluted by utilizing a Gaussian fit with three different
binding energy-centered peaks, as depicted in Figure S4. It is
found that negligible changes in the O

peak are observed
regardless of plasma species in the In

trends for donor-level changes, the variations in the subgap

states located at a
relatively deep energy level (∼1 eV far from the CBM) or
exhibited high formation energy (∼3.5 eV).
46−48
These results
imply that the N
2
O plasma reactant to In
2
O
3
reduces the
donor level, resulting in mobility suppression in the I*GZO
TFT. However, because Ga
2
O
3
has a low electron concen-
tration, the subgap states are more sensitive to the N
2
O plasma
reactant than the donor level, eventually contributing to V
TH
stabilization in the IG*ZO TFT. Meanwhile, the surface
roughness of the IGZ*O slightly increased to other films,
which probably resulted from the N
2
O plasma treatment on
top of ZnO in the IGZO structure (Figure S6).
11,49,50
Because
ZnO is directly in contact with the GI, significant degradation
of SS in the IGZ*O TFTs is presumed to increase in surface
roughness. In addition to the consequences of the N
2
O plasma
reactant effect, determining the causes for the varied N
2
O
plasma reactant effect in In
2
O
3
, Ga
2
O

, and ZnO films is
crucial.
In our experiments, IGZO films were grown by using the
PEALD process, which is entirely distinct from the conven-

tional sputtering process. The PEALD process is based on the
following four steps: precursor dose, precursor purge, plasma
reactant dose, and plasma reactant purge. Specifically, the
plasma reactant dose step plays a key role in film growth
because chemical reactions occur between the O
2
/N
2
O plasma
reactant and the adsorbed precursors. During O
2
and/or N
2
O
plasma ignition, the precursor ligands are oxidized by abundant
O and/or ON radicals and are eventually purged out as CO
and/or CO
2
.
22−24
For N
2
O plasma ignition, the adsorbed-ON
radicals possibly retain the N content in the deposited film,
leading to oxygen-related defect passivation or N-related defect
creation. In addition, the limited plasma exposure time during
PEALD cycles results in an incomplete chemical reaction
between the precursor and oxidant, leading to residual carbon
(C) impurities in the deposited films. These C impurities have
been reported to act as shallow donors in oxide semi-
conductors.
51,52
Therefore, examining whether N
2
O plasma
can affect changes in the N content and C-related impurities is
valuable, which could lead to subgap states and donor-level
differences. Figure 5 depicts the TDS spectra of In
2
O

, Ga

,
and ZnO. The black, red, and blue dots represent the O
2
plasma for 1 s, N
2
O plasma for 1 s, and N
2
O plasma for 5 s,
respectively. To observe the variations in the N content and C-
related impurities, the mass/charge (m/z) ratios of 14 (N), 28
(CO), and 44 (CO
2
) were examined. Notably, the N content
was detected only in Ga
2
O
3
films with increasing the N
2
O
plasma time. Furthermore, considering that the N content is
desorbed above 500 °C, N might form a strong bond with
gallium ions, thereby contributing to decreasing subgap states
in the Ga
2
O
3
film utilizing the N
2
O plasma reactant.
Additionally, In
2
O
3
not only has any N content but also
exhibits negligible changes in the content of O
def
, regardless of
the plasma ignition conditions. Therefore, an increase in the
In
2
O
3
film subgap states with N
2
O plasma treatment time
could possibly result from the creation of oxygen-related
defects (oxygen interstitial or peroxide) caused by excess N
2
O
plasma treatment. In contrast, C-related impurities (CO and
CO
2
) decreased slightly with the N
2
O plasma time compared
to those of the O
2
plasma reactant. Recently, Shiah et al.
reported that CO-related impurities are regarded as donors in
oxide semiconductors and have a greater effect on high-
mobility oxide semiconductors with deep energy levels of the
CBM.
51
Based on this result, a decrease in the In
2
O
3
donor
level would reduce donor-like C impurities with increasing
N
2
O plasma time. However, the decrease in the ZnO donor
level with N
2
O plasma time is thought to predominantly
originate from the decrease in O
def
than that of the CO-related
impurities because ZnO mobility is generally much lower than
that of In
2
O
3
. Additionally, for an in-depth study of the
behavior of N- and C-related species in the N

reactant, the TDS spectra for In
2
O
3
, Ga
2
O
3
, and ZnO films
were analyzed for deliberate enhancements of ON radical
adsorption (N
2
O plasma time of 10 s), as illustrated in Figure
S7. Compared to the N
2
O plasma times of 1 and 5 s, the N
content evidently increased with a significant decrease in C-
related impurities in the In
2
O
3
film prepared using a N
2
O
plasma time of 10 s. This result implies that the N content in
the In
2
O
3
film is closely related to the C-related impurities. For
the Ga
2
O
3
film, the N content increased for the N
2
O plasma
time of 10 s, whereas the C species were comparable to those
for the N
2
O plasma for 5 s. Because the lowest limit of the C-
related impurities was observed for the N
2
O plasma time of 5 s,
the increased N content for the N
2
O plasma for 10 s could be
attributed to the increased frequency of the ON radical
adsorption. However, any N content in the ZnO film was
undetected even when fabricated using a N
2
O plasma time of
10 s, whereas the C-related species evidently decreased with a
N
2
O plasma time. The ZnO film was devoid of N, regardless of
C impurities. Despite the changes in the C and N contents in
the TDS analysis, considering that XPS depth-profile analysis
indicates similar signals in the N 1s and C 1s peaks (Figures
S8−S10), a small amount of N and C impurities keep evidently
changing in the N
2
O plasma reactant.
Understanding the Relationship between N and C
Species Deposited Using N
2
O Plasma Reactants via
Theoretical Interpretation. To understand the relationship
between the C and N species in the In
2
O
3
, Ga
2
O
3
, and ZnO
films fabricated using the N
2
O plasma reactant, DFT
calculations were performed, as shown in Figure 6.
Thermodynamical predictions suggest that CO or CO
2
present
on the surface of reducible oxides desorbs quickly. As indicated
by the TDS spectra, the DFT-calculated CO
2
desorption
energies (E
des
) from the In
2
O
3
, Ga
2
O
3
, and ZnO matrixes are
all compensated by the entropic contribution to the Gibbs free
energy of CO
2
desorption from the oxide surfaces at room
temperature. Because the E
des
values indicate that oxygen ions
at the surfaces oxidize the residual C in the films during
PEALD, CO
2
naturally desorbs, leaving V
O
behind, which
becomes a gateway for ON adsorption and dissociation
(Figure S11). The V
O
generated upon the release of C from
the oxide films strengthens the ON radical binding on the
In
2
O
3
, Ga
2
O
3
, and ZnO surfaces. The surface-adsorbed ON
molecules on In
2
O
3
and Ga
2
O
3
behave in a similar manner.
The ON radical spontaneously dissociated into N and O ions
on the In
2
O
3
and Ga
2
O
3
surfaces, staying over V
O
and healing
them. The strong negative ΔE values presented in Figure 6b,c
confirm that ON dissociation is highly thermodynamically
driven. Consequently, the dissociated N ions are well
embedded in the lattices of the In
2
O
3
and Ga
2
O
3
films,
suggesting that N ions are possibly included within these film
matrices during the PEALD process. In contrast to the DFT
calculation results, N was undetected in the In
2
O
3
film
fabricated utilizing a N
2
O plasma time of 5 s because of the
insufficient driving force of the ON adsorption during the short
plasma time owing to the residual C-related impurities.
However, the significant decrease in C-related impurities in
the In
2
O
3
film prepared utilizing a N
2
O plasma time of 10 s
can trigger the gateway for ON adsorption; therefore N can
form strong bonds with indium ions. In contrast, the ΔE values
of ON dissociation and V
O
healing were primarily neutral on
ZnO as shown in Figure 6d. Therefore, the decrease in the
level of O
def
of ZnO with increasing N
2
O plasma time is
attributed to V
O
healing through the presence of O atoms
formed by ON dissociation. Instead, the ΔE of N
2
production
from a dissociated ON pair was highly negative, corroborating
that the N ions were released from the ZnO film rather than
penetrating the ZnO matrix. This result indicates that the
experimental detection of N within ZnO films synthesized
utilizing a N
2
O plasma reactant is a rare event. Our DFT-based
theoretical interpretation confirms that the energetics of the
serial C impurity release, ON adsorption and dissociation, N
embedment, and N
2
release combined and concurrently
predicted whether the IGZO component diminished the
intrinsic C impurities and accepted the N within the matrix.
PBTS Stability for PEALD-IGZO TFTs with Selective
N
2
O Plasma Reactants. To examine the relationship
between the selective N
2
O plasma reactant and reliability, we
evaluate the negative bias temperature stress (NBTS) and
PBTS stability of the IGZO TFTs fabricated by using N
2
O
plasma for each cation material. During the stability tests, the
devices were stressed under a gate bias stress of ±2 MV/cm for
10000 s at 95 °C. As shown in Figure S12, the devices show
fairly good NBTS stability because of the low hole
concentration in the oxide semiconductors. Figure 7a presents
the transfer characteristics of the reference and selectively N
2
O
plasma-applied IGZO TFTs as a function of the PBTS time,
and the extent of the V
TH
shift after 10000 s is compared in
Figure 7b. The transfer curves of the devices under the PBTS
conditions are shown in Figure S13. The extent of the V
TH
shift was degraded by 68% in the I*GZO TFT compared with
the reference IGZO TFT. Interestingly, the IG*ZO TFTs
demonstrated enhanced PBTS results of up to 50% with
increasing N
2
O plasma time, while negligible changes were
observed in the IGZ*O TFTs. V
O
is popularly regarded as an

important factor in determining the instability of oxide-based
TFTs. In general, V
O
exhibits two types of charge states: a
neutral charge state (V
O
0
) and a 2+ charge state (V
O
2+
) state.
The formation energy for these states relies on the Fermi
energy level (E
F
). During PBTS, the thermal energy accelerates
the V
O
state transitions involving electron traps as follows:
V
O
2+
+ 2e
−
→ V
O
.
3,45−48
For the I*GZO TFTs, degraded
PBTS stability is assumed to originate from the generation of
oxygen-related defects (interstitial oxygen or peroxide) with
increasing the N
2
O plasma time. However, the N content in
Ga
2
O
3
prepared by using the N
2
O plasma reactant can trigger
diminishing V
O
defects, leading to a significantly improved
PBTS stability in IG*ZO TFTs. Further, because of the
negligible changes in the acceptor-like state in the ZnO film,
the IGZ*O TFTs exhibited similar PBTS reliability. Con-
sequently, a PEALD-IGZO TFT with an improved mobility
and stability trade-off could be obtained by the N doping
process in the Ga
2
O
3
layers utilizing N
2
O plasma reactant in its
subcycles.
■
CONCLUSIONS
We successfully designed high-performance PEALD-IGZO
TFTs via selective N doping. The electrical characteristics of
selectively controlled IGZO TFTs primarily rely on the N
2
O
plasma reactant for each cationic material. We discovered that
the variations in oxygen-related defects and C impurities in
N
2
O plasma reactants greatly influence the electrical proper-
ties. In addition, the subgap states are significantly diminished
only in Ga
2
O
3
, which is attributed to N doping via the N
2
O
plasma reactant. Through a combined theoretical and
experimental study, the surface defects derived from intrinsic
C-related impurities were determined to behave as a gateway
for N penetration into Ga
2
O
3
. Owing to these beneficial
effects, IGZO TFTs containing Ga
2
O
3
components grown
with N
2
O plasma reactant exhibit high stability and reliability
under harsh PBTS environments, even after possessing
extremely high mobility (106.5 ± 2.7 cm
2
/(V s)). Our study
provides insight into the proper application of N
2
O plasma
reactants, and this process may help advance the high-
performance semiconductor field.
