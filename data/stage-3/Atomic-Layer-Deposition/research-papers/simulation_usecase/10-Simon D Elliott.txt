Abstract
We present a theoretical framework for the predictive design of atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is the leading
process for the controlled deposition of thin ﬁlms in a variety of technologies. For example, insulating alumina layers
are fabricated by ALD for electroluminescent ﬂat-screen displays and for node DRAM, and are under investigation as
high-k dielectrics for the MOSFET gate. To develop and optimise an ALD process for a new material requires knowl-
edge of the reaction mechanism. By combining structures computed at the quantum mechanical level and literature data
from in situ experiments, we develop a quantitative model of the ALD reaction cycle for alumina deposition. We are
thus able to identify the intrinsic limits on ALD growth and explain how the growth rate depends on process conditions.

1. Introduction
Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)is a chemical
vapour deposition technique, suitable for the slow
and controlled growth of thin, conformal oxide
ﬁlms[1]. Gaseous precursors are admitted sepa-
rately into the reactor in alternate pulses, chemi-
sorbing individually onto the substrate, rather
than reacting in the gas-phase. The reactor is
purged with an inert gas between precursor pulses.
Insulating layers of aluminium sesquioxide (alu-
mina, Al2O3)are fabricated by ALD for electrolu-
minescent ﬂat-screen-displays [1], for node DRAM
and for read/write thin ﬁlm heads [2]. Despite its
modest dielectric constant (k/C249), the large band
gap of alumina and the quality of its interface to
silicon has made it a candidate for MOSFET gate
dielectrics[3], possibly in combination with higher-
k oxides.
Successful precursors for alumina ALD are
trimethylaluminium, Al(CH 3)3 or TMA, and
water, H 2O, which react to give solid alumina
and methane:

Various models for the mechanism of alumina
ALD have been proposed [4–6] but deﬁnitive evi-
dence for the surface intermediates is lacking. A
previous computational study of alumina ALD
considered the energetics of TMA hydrolysis,
including activation energies, under the unhin-
dered conditions of a cluster model, rather than
at a realistic surface[7]. We therefore apply density
functional theory (DFT)to models of the growing
hydroxylated and methylated alumina surfaces, in
order to investigate the atomic-scale structure and
reactivity. The resulting mechanism allows us to
establish the intrinsic limits to ALD growth.
In this work we develop a quantitative represen-
tation of the ALD reaction cycle: a phase portrait
in the space of the chemical concentrations of reac-
tive surface intermediates. The prototype reaction
portrait is shown inFig. 1. In each ALD pulse,
the surface is saturated by precursor fragments
(CH3 or H)that are reactive during the next pulse.
The progress of the ALD process may therefore by
plotted against the surface concentration, [CH3]o r
[H], of each reactive intermediate. The reaction
portrait shows the net rate of precursor adsorption
(horizontal and vertical lines)and of desorption of
the CH4 by-product (diagonal lines)during each
pulse. The Al2O3 growth rate is therefore propor-
tional to the size (height or width)of the portrait
(only surface species are shown on the portrait,
so that there is no explicit representation of the
growth of bulk Al2O3). In a successful pulse–
purge–pulse–purge cycle leading to stoichiometric
growth, there will be no accumulation of either
CH3 or H on the surface, and the cycle will return
to its starting point. The coverages are quoted
without reference to actual surface structure—for
example, it is not speciﬁed whether the H is present
as Al–OH or as Al–OH2, or whether it penetrates
into sub-surface layers.
We will adapt this general representation to the
speciﬁc case of alumina ALD. First principles cal-
culations are used in Section 2 to establish the cov-
erage limits [Me], [H] and these are compared with
literature data. The variation in surface intermedi-
ates with process conditions is considered in Sec-
tion 3, looking in particular at how these change
with temperature.

2.1. Method
The First Principles (FP)method is established
as a reliable way to predict materials properties[8].
Self-consistent DFT within 3D-periodic bound-
ary conditions is used to compute the ground
state electronic structure. We employ the VASP
package[9–11] and use a standard set of technical
parameters, as follows: plane-wave basis <396 eV,
ultrasoft pseudopotentials [12], gradient-corrected
density functional PW91 [13], sparse sampling of
reciprocal space [14], self-consistent wavefunction
converged to 10/C04 eV, and geometry optimisation
to gradients <10/C03 eV/A˚ .
2.2. Methyl coverage
Experimental [5,6,15,16] and theoretical [7,17]
studies have shown that, during the TMA pulse,
Fig. 1. Proposed reaction portrait to illustrate ALD growth of
alumina from TMA and H2O. The space is deﬁned by chemical
concentrations of surface intermediates: they axis is the surface
coverage of CH3, adsorbed fragments of the TMA precursor,
the x axis gives the H concentration, as OH or H2O, resulting
from the H2O precursor. The units are atoms per unit surface
area. The TMA pulse and subsequent purge is indicated as a
solid line, the H2O pulse and purge as a dotted line. The cycle as
shown therefore represents the deposition of 1/2Al2O3 and the
evolution of 3CH4 (diagonal lines)per cell.

the precursor reacts with the hydroxylated surface
to evolve CH 4 and to give adsorbed fragments
Al(CH3)2 and Al(CH 3)(molecularly adsorbed
TMA is unstable against desorption, while bare
Al reacts with neighbouring CH3 [17]). Steric hin-
drance between adsorbed CH 3 groups limits
further adsorption of TMA, and so limits the
deposition rate.
We use a simple model in order to investigate
this steric eﬀect: vertically-oriented Al–CH3 is rep-
resented by H1–CH3 in a single hexagonal close-
packed layer of CH 4 molecules (Fig. 2a). Fixing
the intermolecular C–C distance R (via the cell
size)and constraining H1 to lie below C, the geom-
etry was optimised by FP. The resulting energetics
are shown inFig. 2b. Strain is evident at small R
and correlates with contraction of C–H (e.g.
DE = +1.8 eV and C–H = 1.05 A˚ at R = 3.0 A˚ ).
There is little CH 3–CH3 interaction at R> 3.8 A˚
(DE < +0.2 eV, C–H = 1.10 A˚ ), corresponding to
aC H 3 coverage of 13.3 lmol m/C02, and so this
is a reasonable limit for surface packing of CH 3
during ALD. This is lower than our previous FP
estimate for maximum CH3 coverage [18]. Experi-
ments on variously-treated silica and alumina
surfaces[15] consistently give [CH3] = 5.6 nm/C02 =
9.3 lmol m/C02, one-third lower than our estimate.
2.3. Hydroxyl coverage
Amorphous alumina ﬁlms are deposited by
ALD [1], but the FP method is restricted to simu-
lating periodic systems. We therefore use a slab
model of crystallinea-Al2O3 terminated by the

(0 0 0 1)plane. Convergence of absolute ener-
gies (<1 meV/Al 2O3)and interionic distances
(<0.04 A˚ )was achieved for 6-layer bare slabs
(13.1 A˚ ), separated by at least 6 A ˚ of vacuum.
Each Al2O3 layer is 2.1 A˚ deep and shows a sur-
face density of 8.7 lmol m/C02Al2O3.
Dissociative chemisorption of H 2O onto bare
alumina surfaces produces a monolayer of OH
groups up to the gibbsite-like Al(OH)3 termination
(Fig. 3, [H] = 26 lmol m/C02)and is computed by
FP to release DE = /C01.5 ± 0.1 eV/H2O, matching
that computed elsewhere for the hydration of bulk
anhydrous alumina to gibbsite[19]. This gibbsite-
like surface has been proposed before as the satu-
rating step in alumina ALD[4]. We note in passing
that our simulations also reveal migration of H
into sub-surface layers, as calculated in[19], pro-
ducing a lower-density sub-surface zone of alumin-
ium hydroxide, but such a complex surface model
is not investigated further here. Molecular adsorp-
tion of additional H2O in hydrogen-bonded
networks (O–H = 1.6–2.2 A˚ )on top of the gibb-
site-like surface is computed by FP to show DE
of /C00.7 to /C00.8 eV/H2O, so that these may be a
feature of the surface during the H2O pulse.
Using the Sackur–Tetrode equation [20],w e
estimate that the gas-phase translational entropy
during the subsequent purge isTDS = 1.5 eV/
H2O( T = 450 K, p = 0.5 mPa [5]). By comparison
with the DE above, it is clear that all molecular
H2O will desorb during the purge and that some
OH will recombine and desorb as H2O to leave a
partially-hydroxylated surface with [H] < 26
lmol m/C02.
3. Eﬀect of process conditions on mechanism
3.1. Optimum conditions
Bringing together the mechanistic data from
Sections 2.2 and 2.3, a reaction portrait for opti-
mum alumina ALD is proposed inFig. 4. In this
scheme, starting from the gibbsite-like hydroxyl-
ated substrate, one TMA molecule adsorbs per
surface cell, two CH4 desorb and a surface covered
with capping Al(CH3)is generated. The coverage
of [Me] = 1 per cell corresponds to a coverage of
13lmol m/C02. During the H 2O pulse and purge,
1.5 molecules per cell are needed to adsorb and re-
act, one CH4 is desorbed and the hydroxylated
substrate is restored (2 OH per cell, 26lmol m/C02).
From this cycle we predict that, under optimum
conditions, the maximum growth rate is 1/2Al2O3
per cycle per cell, which corresponds to 0.75
monolayer/cycle or 1.6 A˚ /cycle of a-Al2O3.( A
slight correction may be needed for as-deposited
ﬁlms, since these are/C2410% less dense than a-
Al2O3 [5].)This shows that deposition of a com-
plete monolayer of Al2O3 is impossible, primarily
because of steric hindrance at the surface.
According to this mechanism, about 66% of the
CH4 is lost during the TMA pulse. Support for this

a-Al2O3, computed by FP (light grey = Al, dark grey = C,
white = H).

comes from in situ experiments: the proportion of
CH4 evolved during this pulse is measured as 50%
(measured by quadrupolar mass spectrometry)or
60–70% (by quartz crystal microbalance)[6]. How-
ever, experimental growth rates for alumina ALD
under optimal conditions (a ± 50 K window cen-
tred on 450–500 K)are 1.0–1.1 A ˚ /cycle [5,6,16],
one third lower than our estimate above. This re-
ﬂects the measured CH3 coverage, one-third lower
than that computed (Section 2), because of the lin-
ear relationship between [Me] and growth rate
(Section 3.2).
3.2. Eﬀect of coverage on growth rate
Maximum coverages of ordered CH 3 and OH
groups at T = 0 K are computed in Sections 2.2
and 2.3 respectively. However at elevated temper-
atures, disordered packing and desorption of inter-
mediates (H2O, CH 3-containing fragments)will
ensure that these coverages are not achieved.
Two possible T > 0 K scenarios are illustrated as
reaction portraits in Fig. 5. Changes in the CH 3
coverage have straightforward consequences: the
less TMA that can be adsorbed, the lower the
growth rate. For instance, the reaction portrait
inFig. 5a shows [CH3] at half of theT = 0 K value
and the resultant rate is half of the maximum (i.e.
0.8 A˚ /cycle).
As discussed above (Section 2.3), there is grad-
ual dehyroxylation of the alumina surface with
increasing temperature, even in a H 2O ambient.
However, in contrast to the [Me] case, [H] does
not have a linear eﬀect on growth rate.Fig. 5bi s
the reaction portrait for [H] = 1/cell (i.e. half of
the optimum gibbsite-like termination)at the end
of the H 2O pulse + purge, providing suﬃcient H
to give a surface saturated by an equal mixture
of Al(CH3)and Al(CH 3)2 at the end of the TMA
pulse + purge. The reaction portrait shows that
the overall rate is two-thirds of the optimum, i.e.
1.1 A˚ /cycle. In this way, the model predicts a de-
crease in rate with decreasing [H], i.e. with increas-
ing temperature, in agreement with experiment[6].
However, it should be noted that this is not related
to a decrease in OH as adsorption sites for TMA,
as some authors suggest.
3.3. Eﬀect of mobility on growth rate
Given that there is an energetic barrier to the H-
transfer reaction that leads to CH 4 desorption,
alumina ALD may be limited by kinetics. In gen-
eral, we predict that the growth rate drops in pro-
portion to the reduction in H mobility. For
instance, the reaction portrait inFig. 6 shows half
of the available H reacting to give CH4 during the
H2O pulse + purge, and the resultant rate is half of
the optimum (i.e. 0.8 A˚ /cycle). It is also evident
that some unreacted C and H remains on the
surface throughout the process ([CH 3]>
6.6 lmol m/C02, [OH] > 13 mol m/C02), and this may
result in contamination of the growing ﬁlm. Such

coverage at half the optimum level.

kinetically-limited ALD may occur at low temper-
atures, so that C and H impurity levels are highest
at deposition temperatures <450 K.
4. Conclusion
A theoretical model is presented for the atomic-
scale mechanism of alumina growth by atomic
layer deposition from TMA and H2O precursors.
First Principles density functional calculations
are combined with literature data to determine
the likely intermediates during the reaction cycle
and their surface concentrations. This mechanistic
information allows a quantitative portrait of the
reaction to be sketched in the space of the coverage
of intermediates. As well as giving an estimate of
the maximum theoretical rate, the reaction portrait
illustrates the eﬀect of lower CH3 or OH coverage
(high temperature)and of lower H mobility (low
temperature), both consistent with experiment.
As a general rule, the highest growth rate is
achieved when as much CH4 is evolved during
the TMA pulse as possible. The use of reaction
portraits will simplify the analysis and design of
deposition processes.
