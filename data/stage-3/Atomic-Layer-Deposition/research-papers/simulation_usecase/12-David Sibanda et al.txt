Abstract: The use of computational modelling and simu-
lation methodologies has grown in recent years as researchers
try to understand the atomic layer deposition(ALD) process
and create new microstructures and nanostructures. This
review article explains and simpliﬁes two simulation meth-
odologies, molecular dynamicsand the density functional
theory (DFT), in solving atomic layer deposition problems
computationally. We believe that these simulation methodol-
ogies are powerful tools that can be utilised in atomic layer
deposition. DFT is used to solve problems in surface science
and catalysis(predicting surface energy, adsorption energy,
charge transfer,etc.), semiconductors(band structure, defect
bands, band gap,etc.), superconductors(electron–phonon
coupling, critical transition temperature), and molecular
electronics(conductance, current–voltage characteristics).
Molecular dynamics(MD) is used to predict the kinetic and
thermodynamic properties of a material. Of interest in this
article is a review where diﬀerent material problems ema-
nating from atomic layer deposition from theseﬁelds have
been addressed by DFT and MD. Selected publications are
discussed where DFT and MD have been successfully
applied in atomic layer deposition(and related processes
in some instances). The applications of DFT stretch from
binding energy calculations of molecules and the solid
band structure in chemistry and physics, respectively,
computing the electron density up to determining the
properties of a many-electron system. Also highlighted in
this review study are the challenges that DFT and MD
simulations must overcome.

1 Introduction
Atomic layer deposition(ALD) is a growing material deposi-
tion method, used particularly where precise thickness con-
trol of the material growth is required[1,2].I tc a nb eu s e dt o

lysed experimentally and by computational modelling and
simulations. Experiments are expensive to run since the
ALD equipment and other raw materials are expensive.
They can also pose hazards because sometimes gases
used or released in the chemical reactions are toxic and
occasionally explosive. Modelling and simulations reduce
drastically the costs involved in experiments. ALD[2,5–9]
has grown to become a vital manufacturing technique in
many ﬁelds of nanotechnology, [10–12] semiconductor
processing [13–16], microelectronics[17–21], electrocata-
lysis [22–24], and protective coatings[25–31]. ALD is a
very powerful method of fabricating nanostructures and
nanomaterials, regardless of their complex geometric
shapes, with uniformﬁlms and coatings at the nano,
micro, and atomic levels [7,13,25,32–34]. The computer
simulation of molecular systems has recently increased
in academic and industrial research[35]. Computational
modelling and simulation methodologies have several
advantages over experiments. Some of these are low costs
because they do not require costly equipment and raw
materials. Because of their versatility, they may be used
to investigate and analyse practically any material vir-
tually, including those that produce toxic gases during
their manufacture. They can be performed almost any-
where if adequate computational power is available. Atomic
layer deposition can be modelled and simulated using
various modelling and simulation methodologies such as
computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD), density functional
theory (DFT), Knudsen number, Monte Carlo method, and

molecular dynamics(MD). ALD can be analysed at atomic,
nano, and micro scales. It is essential to know which meth-
odology one must adopt in modelling and simulating ALD.
This review article looks at the two primary modelling and
simulation methodologies that are employed in ALD: the
DFT and molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics uses
Newton’sl a w so fm o t i o nt os i m u l a t ef o r c e so fa t t r a c t i o n
and the position of molecules, while the DFT uses quantum
mechanics principles to simulate the interaction of mole-
cules and atoms. The problems that one can expect to solve
using DFT in atomic layer deposition are predicting the sur-
face energy of a material, adsorption energy calculations,
charge transfer predictions,band structure prediction in
semiconductors, defect bands identiﬁcation, band gap
calculation in semiconductors, electron–phonon coupling
prediction in superconductors, critical transition tempera-
ture prediction in superconductors, and conductance and
current–voltage characteristics in molecular electronics.
MD is used to predict the kinetic and thermodynamic prop-
erties of a material. Other review articles have discussed
DFT/MD for ALD. These include the studies by Ovirohet al.
[2], where they discuss various developments in ALD and
why researchers opt for computational methodologies,
Elliott et al. [36], where various classes of ALD processes
based on mechanistic information from DFT are discussed,
and Guptaet al. [37], who review various advances in
materials design using ALD in the energy application
ﬁelds. The review will also consider where the methods
have been applied, their pros, and challenges to date.
2 Atomic layer deposition process
ALD [3,5,25,38–44] is aﬁlm deposition technique used to
synthesise ultra-thin ﬁlms. The process is based on sequen-
tial self-limiting chemical reactions. In an ALD process, a
substrate on which thinﬁlms must be deposited is placed
inside a reaction chamber at a speciﬁcp r e s s u r ea n dt e m-
perature. Theﬁrst precursor is then injected into the reac-
tion chamber and reacts with the surface of the substrate
forming a thin layer. By-products and excessﬁrst precursor
molecules are eliminated by blowing in inert gas. The
second precursor is then blown in. A chemical reaction
occurs between theﬁrst precursor surface on the substrate
and the second precursor. The excess precursor molecules
and by-products are also carried away by the inert gas
blown in after this reaction. The cycle of precursor
1 → purge → precursor 2→ purge → precursor 3→ purge,
is repeated until the required ﬁlm thickness has been
achieved. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the ZnO atomic
layer deposition using two precursors(C2H5)2Zn (zinc source)
and H2O (oxygen source).
There are several variations of atomic layer deposi-
tion, namely, metal ALD[21], thermal ALD[45,46], particle
ALD [41],p l a s m a-enhanced ALD [45,47–49],p h o t o-
assisted ALD, and area selective ALD[34,50–52]. Metal
ALD is used to deposit metals on a substrate by an elim-
ination reaction. Most metals, except aluminium, can be
deposited by metal ALD. In most cases, the precursors are
a metal halogen(usually a ﬂuoride) and a silicon-based

precursor. Temperatures between 175 and 325°C are usually
employed in metal atomic layer deposition. Thermal ALD is
used where relatively high temperatures are required, for
example, molecules that contain aluminium. Thermal ALD
is used in Al2O3 ALD using trimethylaluminium and water
as precursors. The temperatures range between 150 and
350°C in thermal ALD. Particle ALD is closely related to
the conventional atomic layer deposition process but is
more concerned about coating the entire particle surface,
including the surfaces of nanoparticles. It utilises the prin-
ciples of ALD and applies them to the complex geometry
coating of particles that are spherical in nature. The tem-
perature range for this process varies with the nature of
precursors and substrates but is usually lower than that
o ft h e r m a la n dm e t a lA L D .P l a s m a-enhanced ALD uses
plasma to reduce the temperature required to vapourise
molecules. Kim [53] reports that the following metals,
metal oxides, and nitrides have been successfully deposited
using PEALD: Ti, Ta, Al, Ru, Cu, Co, Ni, W, TiN, TaN, RuTiN,
TiSixNy,T a S ixNy,W 2N, SiNx,A l2O3,T a2O5,Y 2O3,Z r O2,Z n O ,
HfO2,S r T i O3,S r T a2O6,a n dS r B i2Ta2O9.P h o t o-assisted ALD
uses ultra-violet(UV) light to start and speed up surface reac-
tions on the substrate. Photo-assisted ALD can be controlled
by altering the wavelength, illumination time, and intensity of
the ultra-violet light. Miikkulainenet al.[54] reported that few
materials that include GaAs, BN, and metal oxides have been
successfully deposited using photo-assisted ALD.
The ALD process has gained interest and apprecia-
tion among researchers in the past decade due to its
precise and uniform atomic thickness control of the
deposited ﬁlm [2]. Among the diﬀerent thinﬁlm fabrica-
tion processes, ALD is steadily growing to be the pre-
ferred thin -ﬁlm deposition technique. Atomic layer
deposition has several advantages over the other fabrica-
tion techniques, like precise atomic control of deposited
ﬁlm thickness, homogeneousness of thicknesses depos-
ited even on complex three-dimensional surfaces, relatively
lower system temperatures, and improved electronic proper-
ties of devices manufactured fromﬁlms deposited by ALD
[2]. Tables 1 and 2 compare the atomic layer deposition pro-
cess with other thin-ﬁlm fabrication techniques.
Table 3 outlines the strengths and weaknesses of
atomic layer deposition.
2.1 Atomic layer deposition in
nanostructured materials
Nanostructured materials [2,20,32,33,59] are materials
whose structural elements have dimensions that range
from 1 to 100 nm[60]. These structural elements include
molecules, crystallites, and clusters. Nanostructured mate-
rials can be categorised into four classes: carbon-based,
inorganic-based, organic-based, and composite-based
nanomaterials. Jeevanandamet al. [61] found that there
are also other ways of classifying nanostructures such as
their dimensions(0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) and based on their
origins (natural, which are produced in nature by anthro-
pogenic activities or biological species, and synthetic/
engineered nanomaterials).I nt h i sr e v i e w ,w ed i s c u s s

based nanostructures.
2.1.1 ALD on carbon-based nanostructures
Classiﬁed as either metallic or semiconductors, they encom-
pass many low-dimensional carbon allotropes like carbon
black (CB), graphene, fullerene, carbon nanotubes(CNTs),
and carbonﬁbre [62]. Carbon nanotubes are the strongest
one-dimensional materials. Graphene has good electrical
conductivity, high tensile strength, high transparency, and
is the thinnest known two-dimensional material. Nano-
materials are applied in conducting materials, transducers,
biochemical sensors, electronics, and conducting materials.
ALD has been used to coat and decorate nanostructures and
has proved to be the coating technique of choice for carbon-
based nanostructures because of its conformal and self-lim-
iting surface deposition. Theﬁr s tu s eo fA L Dt oc o a tc a r b o n-
based nanostructures, in this case, carbon nanotubes, was
reported by Javeyet al. [63] in 2002. The group deposited
high-k dielectric zirconium oxide thinﬁlms onto single-
walled carbon nanotubes. Leeet al. [64] reported the homo-
geneous coating of multi-walled CNTs(MWCNTs) with Al2O3
from water and trimethylaluminium (TMA) precursors.
Figure 2 shows the transmission electron microscope image
of the Al2O3-coated MWCNTs.
2.1.2 ALD on inorganic-based nanostructures
Examples of inorganic-based nanostructured materials
include transition metal oxides, carbon nanostructures,
and metal nanoparticles. They comprise a non-metal or
metal element and can also take the form of a hydroxide,
oxide, chalcogenide, or phosphate compound [65,66].
They show some characteristics of electrical conductivity
and are used in composite and hybrid materials forﬂex-
ible electronic applications. Atomic layer deposition has
been applied in manufacturing inorganic thinﬁlms using
a 3D nanonetwork structure made of a polymer as a

advanced 3D nanofabrication techniques such as direct

nanofabrication processes chieﬂyy i e l dp o l y m e r-based nano-
network structures. Before these polymers can be applied in
variousﬁelds, they need to be improved. These polymers
have poor mechanical resistance and poor thermal resis-
tance. Typical methods used to ﬁll the interconnected
pores are electrochemical deposition, chemical vapour
deposition, and sol–gel reaction. Functional inorganic
materials such as ceramics and metals are used toﬁll the
interconnected pores. The main challenge of theseﬁlling
techniques discussed earlier is that they lead to the elim-
ination of the porous structure of 3D nanonetworks in a
composite state. That is where ALD comes in. The feature
of conformal coating of ALD of the surface of porous struc-
tures is desirable. Surface properties can be changed, and
the pore size can be reduced while we maintain a porous
structure. With ALD, it is possible to create a lightweight
and highly porous material. It is important to maintain the
least possible process temperature below the polymer
melting point temperature to preserve the 3D nanostruc-
ture during atomic layer deposition of inorganic thinﬁlms
on 3D nanonetworks [66–68]. Figure 3 shows an

3 Atomic layer deposition
simulation methodologies
Atomic layer deposition can be studied experimentally or
numerically. There are many numerical methodologies
employed in atomic layer deposition, among which are
Monte Carlo, Knudsen number, molecular dynamics(MD),
computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD), and DFT. In this
review, we discuss two of these methodologies: DFT and
molecular dynamics.
3.1 Density functional theory
DFT is applied in material science to compute the elec-
tronic conﬁgurations of solids and atoms[69–73].I ti s
deﬁned as a quantum mechanical(QM) modelling meth-
odology applied in chemistry, material science, and phy-
sics to describe the electronic structures of a many-body
system (predominantly the ground state),p r e c i s e l ya t o m s ,
the condensed states, and molecules[74]. Nowadays, it is
used in binding energy calculations of molecules and the
band structure of solids in chemistry and physics, respec-
tively [74,75]. In atomic layer deposition, the DFT can be
used to explore the reaction mechanism between theﬁrst
precursor and the substrate. It can be used to calculate
the electron density and electronic conﬁgurations at this
stage. Where theﬁrst precursor fails to bond with the sur-
face of the substrate, DFT can be used to explain why this
happens. DFT calculations can also be used to improve the
conditions of the substrate so that it is favourable for
bonding with the precursor. After purging the by-products
and excessﬁrst precursor, the second precursor is pumped
into the reaction chamber. DFT can be used to map the
reaction pathway between theﬁrst and second precursors.
It can be used to predict the nature of the reaction and the
by-products from this reaction. DFT can be applied at the
end of the ALD process to predict the thinﬁlm’sm e c h a n-
ical and electrical properties. DFT can be used to validate
the experimental conclusions, diﬀerentiate between pos-
sible opportunities to be explored, or create a foundation
for experiments[23]. DFT aims at calculating the electron

density and not the wave function of electrons. Func-
tionals are used in this theory to ascertain the many-elec-
tron system properties. The functionals in question are of
the spatially dependent electron density in DFT[76].O f
paramount importance in DFT calculations and modelling
is the Schrödinger equation [77]. The equation can be
simply stated as follows:
=Hψ Eψ . (1)
T h es y m b o l sa r ed eﬁned as follows: H – represents
the Hamiltonian operator, ψ – denotes a collection of
Hamiltonian solutions(eigenstates), E – Eigenvalue, according
to Sholl and Steckel[78], when several electrons interact with
multiple nuclei, the following Schrödinger equation form
is used.

The symbolmrepresents the electron mass. Theﬁrst term
in bracket deﬁnes the kinetic energy of each electron, the
second establishes atomic nuclei to electron interaction
energy, and the last is electron to electron interaction
energy [78]. For the Hamiltonian,ψ deﬁnes the electronic
wave function. It is a function of each of theN electrons’
spatial coordinates. The Hartree product[79,80] can be
used to estimateψ as a product of the individual electron
functions. The following is the Hartree equation:
() () ()=…ψψ r φ r ψ r .N1 2 (3)
The symbolN represents a number of electrons.
According to Sholl and Steckel [78], DFT is based
on two signiﬁcant mathematical theorems, which were
derived by Kohn and Hohenberg, as well as the Kohn
and Sham equations, which were derived in the mid-
1960s. Kohn and Hohenberg proved that Schrödinger’s
equation ground-state energy is a distinctive functional
of the electron density[81]. By using the result of Kohn
and Hohenberg, we can express the ground state energy
E as E[n(r)], where n(r) is the electron density. The
major weakness of this theorem is that it does not
deﬁne a functional. This led to Hohenberg–Kohn’ss e c o n d
theorem [82], which addresses an essential property of a
functional. It explains that the electron density minimising
the energy of the total functional is the true electron den-
sity related to the complete solution of the Schrödinger
equation[77,78]. This energy functional can be written
as follows:
[{ }] [{ }] [{ }]=+Eψ E ψ ψ Excl .ii i known (4)
[{ }]φExcl i is a function that describes the exchange-corre-
lation functional. The phrase encompasses the quantum

The ﬁrst right term is the kinetic energies of the electrons,
the second is the electrons to nuclei Coulomb interac-
tions, the third is the pairsof electrons Coulomb inter-
actions, and the last is the pairs of nuclei Coulomb
interactions. Kohn and Sham proved that ﬁnding the

tron [82]. The following is the Kohn–Sham equation:

where V(r) is a potential that deﬁnes the collection of
atomic nuclei to electron interaction,VH(r) is a potential
describing the Coulomb repulsion between one electron
under consideration in one of the Kohn–Sham equations
and the total electron density deﬁned by all electrons in
the question, andVXC(r) is a potential deﬁning exchange
and correlation contribution to the single-electron equa-
tions. It is a“functional derivative” of the exchange-cor-
relation energy.
Kohn–Sham equations[81,83] are solved by deﬁning
the Hartree potential[79].D eﬁning the Hartree potential
requires us to understand the electron density. It is
important to note thatﬁnding the electron density requires
one to know the wave functions of single electrons, but
these can be known when the Kohn–Sham equations are
solved. A circle is thus created. Sholl and Steckel[78] out-
line how somebody may break down this circle by using
the following algorithm:
1) A provisional electron densityn(r) is deﬁned.
2) The initial provisional electron density is employed in
ﬁnding the solution (the single-particle wave func-
tions, ψi(r)) of the Kohn–Sham equations.
3) Next, the electron density, which is deﬁned by the
Kohn–Sham single-particle wave functions, is calcu-
lated from 2, () () ( )=∑nr ψr ψ r2ks i i i
⁎ .
4) Finally, the computed electron densitynKS(r) is com-
pared with the trial electron densityn(r), which was
used to solve the Kohn–Sham equations. The trial
electron density is adopted as the ground-state elec-
tron density if the two densities are the same. It can
then be used in total energy computation. The provi-
sional electron density must be adjusted if the two
densities are diﬀerent. The process then starts all
over again.
A means for the use of the Kohn–Sham equations[82]
is oﬀered by the uniform electron gas. The exchange-cor-
relation potential [76,82,84] must be adjusted to be the
known exchange-correlation potential from the identical
electron gas at the electron density seen at each position.
The following local density approximation(LDA) equa-
tion is used.

For the Hartree–Fock method [79,80,85], approxi-
mating the N electrons wave function, by assuming for
a moment that the electrons do not aﬀect each other, in
this case, the electron’s Hamiltonian is given by:

where hi deﬁnes the energies(potential and kinetic) of
the ith electron.
The Hartree product does not fulﬁl all the essential
criteria for wave functions. The major disadvantage of the
Hartree product is that when two electrons are exchanged,
and its sign does not change. This draws a need for the use
of a superior estimate to the wave function. The Slater
determinant is used as an approximation. One-electron
wave functions are brought together to form theN-electron
wave function, which will satisfy the antisymmetry prin-
ciple. The antisymmetry principle explains that if two elec-
trons exchange positions, the wave function ought to
change the sign because electrons are fermions. The fol-
lowing is the Slater determinant:

For a Hartree–Fock (HF) calculation [79], the atomic
nuclei positions are ﬁxed, and then, the N-interacting
electrons wave function is determined. Each electron’s

where αi,j is the expansion coeﬃcient and ϕi(x) is the
basic set for the computation(where i = 1,2,3,…,k).
Deﬁning the Hartree potential in the equations of single
electrons requires that the electron density is known.
Knowing the electron density needs prior deﬁning of the
electron wave function(which is computed using the sepa-
rate spin orbitals)[ 78]. A Hartree–Fock computation is an
iterative procedure conducted as follows:
1) Estimate the spin orbitals,() ( )=∑=χx αϕxj i
K
ji i1 , through
the speciﬁcation of expansion coeﬃcients, αj,i.
2) Deﬁne the electron densityn(r′) from the approximate
spin orbitals.
3) Solve the spin orbitals equations using the answer
from step 2.
4) The solutions are adopted as the solutions to the
Hartree–Fock problem if the spin orbitals found in
the third step are the same as those used in the second
step. If not consistent, a new estimate should be used,
and then, the procedure is restarted from the second
step.
For the best results, the DFT methodology is applied
at the atomic scale. DFT has proved to be useful in the
forecasting of molecular properties as well[86]. It can be
used as a counterpart of experimental studies. In the
ideal situation, the calculated characteristics are accurate
enough to distinguish between structural replacements
for chemical intermediates or other species that are not
sensitive to the explication of experimental structure
cdd[86].
3.1.1 Applications of DFT calculations in atomic layer
deposition
When ground state DFT calculations are performed, one
can get various routine quantities such as equilibrium
geometry at absolute zero, equilibrium lattice structure,
formation energy, partial charge at each atom, magnetic
state of the system, fermi level, band gap, optical absorp-
tion spectrum, and spin properties [87–91]. In equili-
brium geometry, the calculation yields the geometry
with the minimum forces on each of the atoms in the
system. Band gap calculations tell us the nature of the
material, for example, if it is metallic, semiconductor, or
an insulator. Metallic materials have a band gap of 0 eV,
while insulators have a very large band gap of approxi-
mately 15 eV.
In surface science and catalysis, DFT calculations
can be useful in obtaining the surface properties of a
material. These include surface energy, the adsorption
energy of a gas molecule on a surface, adsorption

conﬁguration of a gas molecule on a surface, bond dis-
tance, charge transfer, reaction energy barrier, and work
function. DFT is useful in predicting the adsorption ener-
gies and conﬁguration of how the gas bonds with the
surface, for example, if the gas is CO, DFT calculations
can predict which atom between oxygen and carbon
bonds with the surface. In charge transfer, DFT can pre-
dict which of the two materials is the charge donor and
which one is the charge acceptor among the molecule
and the surface.
In semiconductors, DFT can predict the electronic
band structure, defect bands, conduction bands, valence
bands, and band alignment across interfaces[92–94].
The band structure is used to explain the electrical prop-
erties of the material. DFT can predict the nature, loca-
tion, and type of the defect.
DFT application is superconductors is still in its infancy.
DFT calculations can predict electron–phonon coupling and
superconducting critical temperature, which is sometimes
referred to as the critical transition temperature. The appli-
cation of DFT to predict electron–phonon coupling has
yielded great success, but the same cannot be said for pre-
dicting critical superconducting temperature.
In molecular electronics, DFT can be used to predict
conductance as a function of the energy and current–vol-
tage characteristics of a material.
In this article, we discuss the applications of DFT in
surface science and catalysis and also in semiconductors.
3.1.1.1 Applications in surface science and catalysis
problems
DFT can be used to investigate area-selective atomic layer
deposition (ASALD) of SiO2 in an ABC– type cycle with
acetylacetone used as a chemoselective inhibitor[52].I n
this cycle, step A entails exposing the surface of the sub-
strate to inhibitor molecules, whereas steps B and C are
the usual conventional ALD process steps. Inhibitor mole-
cules deactivate certain areas of the substrate and prevent
the growth ofﬁlms on those regions during the ALD cycles
(see Figure 4). ASALD has a great potential to be applied in
self-aligned manufacturing systems for future-generation
nanoelectronics[52,95]. In their article, Mameliet al. used
DFT calculations to understand better the chemoselective
Hacac mechanism of adsorption at the molecular scale.
The team evaluated the structures, and their related rela-
tive energies for the stationary points along the minimum
energy paths(MEPs) needed to absorb Hacac inhibitor on
aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide. Figure 5 shows the
DFT (GGA/PBE-D3)[ 96] of minimum energy paths(MEPs)
needed to absorb Hacac on(a) aluminium oxide(Al2O3)
and (b) silicon dioxide(SiO2) surfaces [52].
The function, projector augmented wave(PAW)[ 97,98]
was used by Mameliet al. [52] as executed in Viennaab initio
simulation package(VASP) to perform electronic structure
calculations[98–100].T h e yc a r r i e do u tﬁrst-principle computa-

to the DFT. Two distinguishing binding orientations were
identiﬁed by their DFT calculations for physisorption.
Gas-phase density functional theory(GPDFT calcula-
tions can be used to explain valence and core levels gas-
phase photoelectron spectroscopy of transition metal
alkyla-mino complexes, M(N(CH3)2)4. where M in this
case, is Titanium(Ti) or Hafnium(Hf)[ 38]. These calcu-
lations can be used to predict atomic layer deposition
reactions on the surfaces of these molecules. In their
research, Shayesteh et al. performed DFT calculations
using the hybrid M06-2X [101] functional as executed
in the Gaussian 09 code[102].T h ed o u b l e-ζ 6-31G(d,p)
b a s i ss e tw a su s e df o rt h eh y drogen, carbon, and nitrogen
atoms. The LanL2DZ basis set[103–105], together with the
Los Alamos eﬀective core potential, was utilised for the
hafnium and titanium atoms. Population analysis tech-
niques of Kohn–Sham orbitals were used to allocate valence
spectra of Hf (N(CH3)2)4 and Ti(N(CH3)2)4 compounds.
Through the use of DFT calculations, computed vertical
ionisation energies and adiabatic ionisation energies were
matched with their data from experiments.
DFT, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, can be
employed to model equilibrium conformation of Pt2Ru3
nanoparticles [106] utilised in polymer electrolyte fuel
cells as anode catalysts(PEFCs)[ 107–109]. Alam, Saito,
and Takaba conducted DFT calculations to approximate
(using slab conﬁgurations) the binding energy. Pt–Ru
alloys signiﬁcantly enhance the catalytic performance
in the electrochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide from
carbon monoxide-contaminated H2 fuels or suppression
of carbon monoxide adsorption on the catalyst[110–112].
The DFT calculations showed that in the Pt2Ru3 alloy slab
conﬁguration, platinum atoms covered the top surface, or
am o r es i g n iﬁcant percentage of platinum led to higher
stability compared to other conformities of atoms. The
second layer is favourably comprised ruthenium atoms or
a greater proportion of ruthenium atoms for stable struc-
tures. The quantity of Pt–Ru bonds in Pt2Ru3 i n c r e a s e sa st h e
particle size also increases. Figure 6 shows the diﬀerent slab
conﬁgurations.
DFT was applied in ALD-triggered iron–indium–sul-
phur cluster and gradient energy band in zinc–indium–
sulphur photoanode to improve the reaction of oxygen
evolution[113].M e n get al. did their DFT calculations using
VASP [113]. The team designated Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional for the electron interactions of the
exchange correlation [114]. Meng et al. [113] chose the
projected augmented method[97] to hypothesise the pseu-
dopotential for treating the interactions of ion to electron
[97]. For all other calculations, the team employed pane-
wave cut-oﬀ energy of 400 eV and 4× 4 × 1 Γ-centred
Monhorst–Pack k-point mesh [115].D F T-D3 method of
Grimme was adopted to deﬁne the interactions of van
der Waals [116]. DFT has also been used to investigate
exceptionally dry methane reforming catalysts with
enhancedin situ produced Ni–Fe nanoparticles on per-
ovskite through ALD, which have been demonstrated to
be extremely eﬀective [117]. Similarly, some studies aimed
to develop active and durable catalysts [51,118–120].
DFT calculations were used to reveal the method of the

improved exsolutionvia atomic layer deposition. The DFT
calculation results showed that the order of Ti< Cr < Fe <
Mn < Co < Ni < Cu was followed by the co-segregation
energy. This implied that bulk Ni could be replaced with
deposited iron (Fe)[ 117]. Figure 7 shows DFT-computed
cation exchange energies of deposited bulk Ni and tran-
sition metals. The deposited metal can freely exchange
with Ni as indicated by the negative sign in exchange
energy.
Density functional theory has been utilised to inves-
tigate the growth mechanism of zinc oxide ALD[121].I n
their investigation, Afshar and Cadien [121 ] used
GAUSSIAN 09[102] to execute molecular orbital calcula-
tions. To determine the geometry of the stationary points,
the corrected density functional approach(B3LYP gra-
dient) was used [70,121]. In their conclusion, Afshar
and Cadien [121] suggested a comprehensive atomistic
mechanism for zinc oxide ALD growth employing the
DFT study of(C2H5)2Zn and H2O half-reactions on a zinc
oxide surface. By using this DFT approach, they showed
that the two reactions proceeded through the creation of
complexes on the surface. Theﬁrst growth mechanism of
zinc oxide ALD on hydroxylated Si was investigated by
Ren [122]. He presented the impact of single and double

conformations of platinum and ruthenium atoms[106].

hydroxyl sites on the initial phases of the atomic layer
deposition growth[123].
DFT was used in the preliminary reaction mechanism
investigation of atomic layer deposited Pt on a hydroxy-
lated graphene surface[19]. In their investigation, Moh-
lala et al.used molecular oxygen and methylcyclopenta-
dienyl trimethylplatinum(MeCpPtMe3) as their precursors.
In their research, the reaction pathways were analysed
using DFT calculations under Dmol3 code in Materials
Studio software, a product of Accelrys Software Inc[124].
Their DFT calculations established that the elimination
reaction of the methyl group bonded to platinum happens
more easily than the freeing of the MeCp ligand[19]. They
adopted two possible conﬁgurations to investigate which
interaction was more stable between the precursor and the
site of adsorption. Models(a) and (b) were created in
which model (a) interacted through the MeCp ring and
model (b) interacted through one of the methyl groups,
which is bonded to platinum. Their DFT simulation and
calculations showed that model(b) is the most stable con-
ﬁguration [19]. Figure 8 shows the preliminary orientation
of MeCpPtMe3 on the surface of grapheme, which was
hydroxylated.
Ali and Hashim utilised DFT to study the zinc oxide
ALD on graphene[77]. Graphene has outstanding optical,
electrical, chemical, and mechanical characteristics[125–127].
Graphene is now being used in the development of next-gen-
eration functional nanoparticles for numerous applications.
DFT was employed inﬁnding an estimated Schrödinger equa-
tion solution. They performed a DFT simulation of infrared
(IR) characteristics in support of the proposed mechanism
through a broad clariﬁcation of forming and breaking of

structures, transition states, intermediate states, and dissocia-
tion reaction products. Figure 10 shows the infrared data
when graphene oxide matrix adsorbed Zn–H, which was
computed using DFT, and the associated optimised structures
for several Zn2+ adsorption steps[77].
Mohlala et al. [128] employed DFT in their article on
the thermal stability of Ti halide precursors for the TiO2
ALD on Pt(111) substrate. DFT was employed to ascertain
the reactivity and thermal stability of Ti-based halide
precursors. They also used DFT in conjunction with the
computerised numerical technique and the dissociation
of bond ligand automation tool from the Schrödinger
material science package[129–131] to study and evaluate
the thermal stability and reactivity of the precursors. The
reason for the use of DFT is that they knew it as a pro-
mising technique to understand the chemistry of innova-
tive ALD precursors and enabling precursor development,
which has high selectivity and reactivity and thermal stabi-
lity [132–134]. By using DFT simulation and calculation,
Mohlala et al. predicted Ti tetrahalide(ﬂuorine, chlorine,
and iodine) precursors through the use of Schrödinger’s
automated enumeration tool. They predicted that a library
of three halides forms 81 diﬀerent complexes, 15 of which
have exceptional ligand compositions[128]. The precursors
were improved utilising DFT as realised in Jaguar[131].
Figure 11 shows an illustration of 15 of the precursors.
Becker and Sierkar[70] employed DFT in their ato-
mistic simulations research of plasma-enhanced ALD.
Their primary investigation of the precursor products
with hydroxylated silicon dioxide surfaces used DFT cal-
culations and showed that reaction energies were highly
dependent on the surface structure[20], speciﬁcally for
the precursor which is bonded to two oxygen atoms on
the surface.

Time-dependent DFT in conjunction with the Ehrenfest
dynamics scheme was employed by Leeet al. [135] for the
investigation of the dissociation of cobalt tricarbonyl nitrosyl
(Co(CO)3NO) ligands caused by electronic excitation. The
team scrutinised excited-state non-adiabatic dynamics of
ligand dissociation of Co(CO)3NO. Cobalt tricarbonyl nitrosyl
is a precursor mainly utilised to grow cobalt thinﬁlms in
innovative technologies, wherethe reaction of the precursor
is improved by electronic excitation. They studied the Co
(CO)3NO microscopic details ofdissociation motivatedvia
electronic excitation and established two direct and distinct
dissociation paths of the NO ligand on the cobalt tricarbonyl
nitrosyl(Co(CO)3NO).
Murray and Elliott[134] employed DFT in the predic-
tion of the composition of ALD-grown ternary oxides.
They calculated using DFT methods the geometry opti-
mised structures and energies for 17 metal precursors
withﬁve diﬀerent anionic ligands and their corresponding
hydrolysed complexes. The hydrolysis DFT models were
utilised to eﬀectively clarify the reaction and stoichiometric
result with regards to metal cation ratios, which were seen
through experiments for diﬀerent ALD-grown systems for
ternary oxides [134]. When it comes to electronic inter-
change and correlation, transition metal complex compu-
tations are prone to inaccuracies; therefore, the selection of
the proper DFT functional is vital to yield correct geometries
and enthalpies of reactions. Their DFT calculations con-
ﬁrmed that metal complexes that contain the alkoxide
OtBu andβ-diketonate thd ligand are substantially unreac-
tive with regard to the removal of H–thd during atomic layer
deposition. Most of the ALD ternary oxides were success-
fully predicted by the DFT models that were used in their
research for the interactions of metal precursors with oxide
surfaces, demonstrating that DFT models may be used to
predict experimental metal cation concentrations.
Dkhissi et al. used DFT in multiscale modelling of HfO2
ALD of thin ﬁlms, which were grown on silicon[136].
When the DFT model was applied in the hybrid functional,
it was possible to determine the complete physicochemical
processes and their related energies of the two half-cycles
that occurred at the initial stage of theﬁlm development. It
was demonstrated in their work that a novel kinetic Monte
Carlo (KMC) methodology could be developed within a
multiscale approach, starting with molecule–surface inter-
actions that were primarily treated at the DFT level of

modelling and progressing to atomic-scale ﬁlm growth
that was conducted using a KMC technique[136].
3.1.1.2 Applications in semiconductors
Weckman et al. [91] utilised DFT in the study of zinc oxide
atomic layer deposition. In their research, they investi-
gated the ZnO thin ﬁlm growth, which was grownvia
DEZ/H2O process. To achieve this, they modelled the sur-
face chemistry usingﬁrst-principles kinetic Monte Carlo
(KMC). The KMC enabled them to easily extract data
equivalent to experimental results by incorporating DFT
calculations done on the ZnO(100) surface into a kinetic
model. ZnO is a semiconductor, and its properties include
high transparency, piezoelectrical properties, and tun-
able electrical conductivity. It can be applied in transis-
tors, sensors, and solar cells[137–139]. The results of the
DFT-simulated mass increment data during an atomic
layer deposition cycle were found to tally with the experi-
mental ﬁndings and showed that the majority of the
deposited layer is formed during the DEZ pulse [91].
The activation energy for chemical processes was also
calculated using DFT.
Sun et al. [140] used ﬁrst principles DFT calculations
to study the chlorine residue eﬀects on the ALD of Haf-
nium oxide (HfO2). HfO2-based gate dielectrics are ther-
modynamically stable with silicon. The density of the
state was calculated using the CASTEP code utilising
the local density approximation method to get the elec-
tronic band structure of HfO2. Their calculations yielded
a band gap of 6.69 eV, which was comparable to the
reported experimental value of 5.6 –5.9 eV since they
had neglected excitonic and phonon broadening eﬀects,
which typically would have reduced their calculated
value by 0.8 eV. The team noted that chlorine decreases
the band gap of hafnium oxide(by 0.58 eV) by increasing
the valence band maximum(VBM). There are two types of
defects in hafnium oxide(substitutional and interstitial
defects), and these two harm the hafnium oxide gate
dielectric electrical performance[140].
Kelaidis et al. [94] used DFT to study the Sn1−xPbxO
electronic properties and the SnO/PbO system band align-
ment. The SnO grown by atomic layer deposition was
doped with Pb to form Sn1−xPbxO. The team conducted
DFT calculations to investigate the electronic and struc-
tural properties of Sn1−xPbxO. They investigated the orbital
eﬀects in the valence and conduction band states. They
also investigated the eﬀect of the intrinsic defects on band
alignment on Sn vacancies in SnO and Oxygen vacancies
in PbO. The team found out that Pb doping provided a way
of SnO band gap tuning without the introduction of defect
states in the gap region. They also discovered that a 0.4 eV
increase of SnO was observed when 2% Sn vacancies are
introduced. The team noted that the energy band gap of
Sn1−xPbxO increased virtually linearly from 0.4 up to 1.4 eV
as thex value is increased from 0 to 1. Figure 12 shows the
computed band gap with regards to the Pb content in the
compound.
3.1.2 DFT calculation challenges
The Schrödinger equation cannot be solved precisely for
a multi-body system; hence, DFT simulations use approx-
imations. The accuracy of the adopted approximation
governs the usefulness of their DFT simulations for sev-
eral properties [141]. The precise handling of electron
correlation founds a signiﬁcant challenge in DFT. Elec-
tron correlation is frequently described with regard to a
Hartree–Fock wave function. According to the variational
principle, the lowest energy orbitals may be found by
leveraging the HF wave function, a single-conﬁguration
wave function derived by employing the variational prin-
ciple. The diﬀerence between a system’s exact energy and
its HF energy at the entire basis set limit is typically used
to calculate electron correlation energy[141].
The most frequently utilised DFT form is the Kohn–Sham
formulation[142].T h eK S-DFT signiﬁes the density using a
single Slater determinant and has a mean-ﬁeld formulation,
b u ti ti sa ne x a c tt h e o r y[141]. The energy in Kohn–Sham
density functional theory is not computed by additional
conﬁguration state functions(CSFs), but by employing an
exchange-correlation functional, that is a density

compound [94].
Atomic layer deposition modelling and simulation methodologies 1347

functional. We must, therefore, estimate the functional of
the exchange correlation. The existing functionals are
more precise for correlated systems that are weak than
the strong ones. Self-consistent-ﬁeld variational computa-
tions are used to determine the orbitals of a Kohn–Sham
density functional theory determinant. The variational
principle at times may account for static correlation by
using a slater determinant with diﬀerent symmetry proper-
ties from the precise state wave function.
KS-DFT can lead to an error source of delocalisation,
sometimes called self-interaction error [143]. By substi-
tuting nonlocal high-frequency exchange for a portion of
the local exchange-correlation functional, the self-inter-
action error can be reduced[85,144]. DFT does not treat
discrete electrons in precisely identical ways but uses
their total density. This means any one-electron system
does not play a distinct unique role in DFT. The Coulomb
energy for one electron is cancelled by the exchange
energy[145]. The orbital rotation operator that is used
for generating a foundation for time-dependent DFT equa-
tions generates only the conﬁgurations that are singly
excited with regard to the ground state. This means higher
order excitation states(e.g., the excitations with a high
degree of double excitation character) are excluded in
time-dependent DFT. However, they can be incorporated
through the exchange-correlation functional[142].
Many variants of the modern density-built subsystem
and embedding approaches[146–148] use potential recon-
struction techniques[149–151]. This leads to a target den-
sity being rationalised numerous times in a self-consistent
loop. The potential matching that target density needs to
be calculated at every step of the loop, leading to a con-
siderable added computational expense to simulations
that make no use of eﬀective inversion methods.
The other challenge of DFT is its complexity. DFT
loses its simplicity when DFT functionals become com-
plicated like the full conﬁguration interaction(FCI). This
is factual of its nature of computation. However, the attrac-
tiveness and challenges of DFT lie in between simple and
very complex[145].
3.2 Molecular dynamics
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [70,152–154] is a
computational procedure for computing the transport
properties and equilibrium of a classical many-body system
[155]. MD focuses on the dynamics of atoms, molecules, and
clusters in the condensed and liquid states[156].I ti su s e d
in many engineering and science disciplines like chemistry,
physics, and materials engineering to determine the motion
and equilibrium conditions of each atom or molecule.
During theﬁrst stage of the atomic layer deposition pro-
cess where theﬁrst precursor is forced into the reaction
chamber, molecular dynamics calculations can be used to
predict the kinetic properties of molecules such as material
structure and complex and the stability of the substrate–
precursor 1 bond. It can predict the binding energy between
the substrate and the ﬁrst precursor molecules. In the
second stage where the by-products and excessﬁrst pre-
cursor are purged, MD can be applied to predict the
mechanism of removal. In the third stage where the second
precursor is pumped into the reaction chamber, MD simu-
lations can be used to predict the nature of the reaction,
the binding energy between theﬁrst and second precursor
atoms, and the stability of the bond. It can also be applied
in the fourth stage the same way as the third stage since
these purging stages have the same principles. Molecular
dynamics can be used to predict the thermodynamic
properties of the deposited thin -ﬁlm material, based
on intermolecular interactions. The deposited thinﬁlm
can be analysed by MD simulations to predict free
binding energy, the heat of vapourisation, and boiling
point. According to Sator[157], the molecular dynamics
method is valid in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium
physical phenomena. Molecular dynamics is a useful com-
putational approach that may be used in simulating var-
ious physical phenomena[158,159] if there is satisfactory
computation power. Besides ReaxFF[70,160–162],o t h e r
computational software that can be used in molecular
dynamics simulations are LAMMPS[163–166],N A M D[167],
GROMACS, CHARMM[167],a n dA M B E R[168,169].T h em o l e-
cular dynamics method uses Newton’s equations of motion
to describe the motion of molecules. It is simple and logical
[170]. Simulation of particleﬂow on a computer MD program
follows the equations of motion[157,171].T h ef o r c ee x e r t e d

Equation (18) is an algebraic equation; therefore, the next

next time step position of molecules. If velocity is required,
it is calculated from the central diﬀerence approximation.
The velocity equation is expressed as follows:
() () () =  +−−v t rt h rt h
h2 .i
ii (19)
Noting that the positionalﬁrst and second-order diﬀer-
entials are identical to the velocity and acceleration, in
that order, ignoring diﬀerential terms equivalent to or
higher than the third order in equation(14) yields:
( ) () () ()+=  + +r rv fth t ht h
m t2 .ii i

(20)
Since the term of velocity appears on the right, another
equation to specify velocity can be employed.
( ) () ()+  =  +vv fth t h

The force term can be modiﬁed to improve accuracy. The
equation becomes:
()( ) ( () )+  =  + +vvfth t h
m th2 .ii

When the central diﬀerence approximation is applied
to theﬁrst-order diﬀerentials, we get these two equations:
()( ) ⎛

According to Sator[157], when using the velocity Verlet to
carry out a molecular dynamics simulation, the primary
procedure is as follows:
1. The initial position and velocity of the molecules must
be hypothesised.
2. Next, the forces that act on molecules must be calculated.
3. The next time step positions of molecules must be
evaluated from equation(20).
4. The next time step velocities of molecules must be
evaluated from equation(22).
5. Procedures from the second step are repeated.
3.2.1 Applications of molecular dynamics simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations can be used to predict
the kinetic properties of molecules[95,158,169,172]. Kinetic
properties are time-based evolutions of conformations.
These include reﬁnement of material structure and com-
plex, stability of structures, conformational sampling of
small molecules, protein folding, stability of protein–ligand
interactions, and transport of ions and ligands.
MD can be used to predict the thermodynamic prop-
erties of a material. These predictions are based on inter-
molecular interactions. MD simulations can predict free
binding energy, heat of vapourisation, pressure, boiling
point, Poisson–Boltzmann or generalised Born and sur-
face area continuum solvation, and free energy perturba-
tion (FEP).
Molecular dynamics is most suitable for the applica-
tion at the nanoscale. There are various applications
of molecular dynamics as identiﬁed by Gunsteren and
Berendsen[173]. The following are some of the applications:
i. Interpretation of biochemical [174,175 ] data on
repressor–operator binding.
ii. Interpretation of biophysical[176] data on membrane
properties.
iii. Reﬁnement of structures based on nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) data [112,177]. Tampieri deﬁnes NMR
spectroscopy as an analytical method that provides
data on the local magneticﬁeld around atomic nuclei
[178]. Its principles are that the structural or chemical
Atomic layer deposition modelling and simulation methodologies 1349

composition of substances can be known from their
nuclei, which have their distinctive magneticﬁeld.
iv. Reﬁnement of structure based on crystallographic X-
ray or deutron diﬀraction data[179].X -ray crystallo-
graphy is used to determine three-dimensional crys-
talline structures at the atomic scale[180].
v. Prediction of structural changes.
vi. Prediction of free energy changes.
3.2.1.1 Applications of MD in predicting the kinetic
properties of molecules
Molecular dynamics simulations can be utilised in the
atomistic simulations study of plasma-enhanced ALD
[20,47,70]. In their research article, Becker and Sierka
[70] presented a simulation structure for plasma-enhanced
atomic layer deposition processes by compounding the
Monte Carlo[157,179] deposition algorithm and structure
relaxation using MD to account for the steric interruption
and the surface overlap restrictions consistent with the
actual step of precursor deposition. The structure was
relaxed after each step of attachment, using either local
structure optimisation or short-simulated annealing using
MD. They calculated the chemisorption energy and used
it to compute the acceptance criterion using the Metro-
polis-Hastings rule[181]. They also applied their simula-
tion procedure to study the PEALD synthesis of silicon
dioxide thinﬁlms employing a bis-diethylaminosilane pre-
cursor. Preliminary examination of the precursor products
with hydroxylated silicon dioxide surfaces using DFT cal-
culations showed a strong reliance of reaction energies on
the structure of the surface, speciﬁcally for the precursor
that was bonded to two oxygen atoms at the surface. Their
PEALD simulations showed that the precursor binding to
one oxygen atom at the surface favours amorphous layer
growth, many–OH impurities, and the voids formation.
Molecular dynamics simulation can be applied to inves-
tigate the sinking of graphene during chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) growth on a substrate of semi-molten
copper[119]. The principles of the molecular layer deposition
procedure are synonymous with ALD since, in both pro-
cesses, theﬁlms are created by successive, self-restraining
surface reactions[182–184].X u et al. executed systematic
MD simulations to discover graphene nanostructures stabil-
ity (graphene nanoribbons and carbon nanoclusters) on a
substrate of semi-molten copper. Figure 13 shows C24 sinking
on the surface of Cu(111) at various temperatures.
Molecular simulations and Markov state modelling
can be used to disclose the structural variety and dynamics
of a theophylline-binding ribonucleic acid aptamer in its
unbound state[185].W a rﬁeld and Anderson applied MD
simulations to characterise the ensemble of conformations
adopted by the aptamer in the absence of theophylline and
also applied the Markov state modelling to forecast the
transition kinetics between liberated conformational states.
Ribonucleic acid aptamers are oligonucleotides that con-
nect with high speciﬁcity and attraction to targeted ligands
[185]. It was observed in their simulations, as well as in the
experiments, that the theophylline binding site may be
located in a variety of binding-incompetent states, all of
which lack a binding pocket capable of holding theophyl-
line. Binding-incompetent states can become binding com-
petent by rearranging the binding site structurally on a
period ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds.
MD can be used to simulate theﬁlm structure of Al2O3
and its composition during atomic layer deposition[186,187].
Hu et al.managed to get the density of aluminium oxide per
ALD cycle. Figure 14(a) shows the density proﬁles of Al2O3 at
300°C, and Figure 14(b) shows the number density of O, AL,
and H.
MD simulations allowed them to trace the progres-
sion of the Al2O3 ﬁlm microscopic structure as it grew in
thickness [186]. They found that the surface of Al2O3 is
ended mainly by hydrogen and oxygen since they are the
favourite for the ambient. This enabled them to conclude
why hydrogen impurities in atomic layer-deposited Al2O3
ﬁlms are generally low.
Zheng et al. [10] used MD simulations in their research
on modelling andin situ probing of surface reactions in
ALD. As part of their investigation into the eﬀect of early
surface chemical states on the reaction kinetics and the
creation of traps during ALD nucleation, they looked at
Al2O3 ALD deposition kinetics[148] on hydrogenated and
oxidised Ge surfaces. Their simulations included ReaxFF
[70,154,160,161], molecular dynamics(MD),a n dn u d g e d
elastic band(NEB)[ 188] to mimic the deposition process,
including adsorption and breakdown of ALD precursors,
as well as the diﬀusion and desorption of their products
produced. Their simulation s accurately predicted the
nucleation features, which were in close accord with the
available literature and experiments. Figure 15 shows the
TMA and H2Od o s ei nt h e i rR e a x F Fs i m u l a t i o n .
Xiao et al. [154] used MD simulations to investigate
the surface chemistry of Cu metal and CuO ALD from
copper(II) acetylacetonate. The results of this simula-
tion showed copper(II) acetylacetonate chemisorbs on
the hollow site of the copper(110) surface and decays
readily into a copper atom and the acetylacetonate
ligands. Figure 16 shows snapshots for the reactive
molecular dynamics dissociation of copper(II) acetylace-
tonate on the Cu(110) surface.

Figure 17 shows the reactive MD snapshots for the
reaction between copper(II) acetylacetonate and hydrogen
atoms on the copper(110) surface. Atomic hydrogen was
highly reactive towards the copper precursor. The Cu
(acac)2 broke the Cu−O bonds upon hydrogen collision
forming a H2(acac) molecule. It was then released to the

abstracted by H and an H2O molecule was released(15.2 ps).
The fragment remaining was broken down further into ethane
and acetone (20.3 ps). Finally, a methane molecule was
formed(22.4 ps)[ 154].
Ab initioMD simulation of a copper monolayer aggre-
gation on a WN(001) surface was investigated by Boet al.
[189]. They carried out anab initio molecular dynamics
simulation with a copper monolayer at 500 K on the sur-
face, which was completely equilibrated. Figure 18 shows
the molecular dynamics chosen snapshots of the trajec-
tory. The copper monolayer was initially well aligned and
in proportion with the substrate. Through surface diﬀu-
sion, copper atoms were then rapidly disassembled and
moved away from their equilibrium locations when mole-
cular dynamics was run. Att = 1 ps, some copper atoms
began to move upward and grow three dimensionally. At
t = 3 ps, the copper atoms were clustered together and
formed islands at the surface. An ordered monolayer
structure became remarkably disordered. Further mole-
cular dynamics runs prompted copper atoms to constantly
move, forming surface islands with diﬀerent shapes. No
wetting of copper clusters on the surface was detected.
Guoyong et al. [190] applied MD in surface pseudo-
rotation in Lewis-base-catalysed SiO2 ALD. The pathways
of the reaction for the uncatalysed and catalysed SiO2 atomic
layer deposition were explored using static transition-state
searches and Born–Oppenheimer MD simulations. The team
discovered that the reaction for uncatalysed SiO2 atomic
layer deposition undergoes a step-by-step pathway. The
step that determines the rate is the Si–O bond development
complemented by the rotation of SiCl4 and has a compara-
tively high activation free energy barrier.
3.2.1.2 Applications of MD in predicting a material’s
thermodynamic properties
Guo and Wang, in their research of thinﬁlms of noble metal
alloys by ALD and rapid Joule heating[191], performed MD
simulations using large-scale atomistic/molecular massively
parallel simulator(LAMMPS) open-source code [192,193].
They adopted the embedded atom method(EAM) potentials
[194] in portraying the interatomic interactions, which
deﬁne the lattice parameter, surface energy, cohesive
energy, elastic constant, transitional and thermody -
namic properties of metals, as well as their alloys.
Figure 19 illustrates a schematic of the fabrication pro-
cess of the thinﬁlm alloy of Rh/Ir.
From their research and simulations, Guo and Wang
concluded that the ALD technique can manufacture fairly
uniform and continuous sub-ﬁfty-nanometre thick alloy
thin ﬁlm on 2D substrates when compared to other methods
of manufacturing alloys. They also employed MD simula-
tions to explore the melting of the Rh/Ir thinﬁlm alloy.
Molecular dynamics can be applied to investigate
temperature and nitrogen-to-aluminium ratio eﬀects in
the heteroepitaxial growth of aluminium nitride. Zhang
et al.[195] noted in their simulations that when the tem-
perature increased from 1,000 to 2,000 K with a nitrogen-
to-aluminium ﬂux ratio of 2.0, the growth rate of the
Figure 14:(a) Blue line shows the total density proﬁles at 0 ALD cycles, red for four ALD cycles, and green for eight ALD cycles with respect to

hydrogen (red) as a function of theZ-direction distance of Al2O3 ﬁlm at 300°C[186].

aluminium nitrideﬁlm decreased. They also observed that
deposited aluminium nitride crystallinity was noticeably
enhanced as the temperature increased between the 1,000
and 1,800 K temperature range, and it became saturated
between 1,800 and 2,000 K. Stoichiometry was found to be
closely associated with the depositedﬁlms crystallinity.
Good crystallinityﬁlms are related to a near 50% nitrogen
fraction. In their simulations,the aluminium nitride growth
on the c-plane aluminium nitride was studied by the
LAMMPS [193] with the Tersoﬀ potential [196].F i g u r e2 0

perature of 1,800 K with various nitrogen-to-aluminiumﬂux

Molecular dynamics simulations can be utilised to
investigate the melting of iron nanoparticles with or
without defects. Karpinaet al.[137] used MD simulations
to investigate the thermal properties of bulk iron material
and iron nanoparticles(FNP) by means of a ReaxFF reac-
tive forceﬁeld. The melting behaviours of FNPs from 300
to 2,500 K were chosen to study thermodynamic and
energy properties, which include potential energy plots,
radial distribution function, and Lindemann index[120].
They observed that the ReaxFF forceﬁeld could detect the
size eﬀect in FNP melting regardless of energy or struc-
ture evolution aspect. The following table shows the
FNP model information for melting simulations. In their
article, Sunet al. state that there are four methods to
evaluate materials melting points[197–199] in molecular
dynamics. (1) Plots of potential energy;(2) system heat
capacity Cv, and (3) Lindemann index [200] that vary
with temperature and equilibrium temperature[161] of
the solid–liquid interface(see Table 4).
Figure 21shows one of the ways of evaluating melting
points, theCv (heat capacities) of various size FNPs as a
function of temperature obtained from simulations.
3.3 Molecular dynamics simulation
challenges
Just like any other modelling and simulation methodolo-
gies, molecular dynamics has its shortcomings. This is
discussed in the following paragraphs.
Figure 16:Reactive MD dissociation of copper(II) acetylacetonate on
the Cu(110) surface [154]. Initially, the Cu–O bond broke and the
acac-ligand tilted(7.3 ps). The acac-ligand then totally dissociated
from the Cu(acac)2 molecule, thereby creating acac and Cu(acac)
species on the surface(10.8 ps). Finally, Cu(acac) dissociated into
copper and acac species on the surface after 18.5 ps[154].

MD simulations can be applied to analyse chemical
processes, which include biomolecules allosteric transi-
tions, phase transformation nucleation events, chemical
reactions, solids fracture and crack propagation, crystals
defect dynamics, and many other applications. These
simulations, however, may take several days depending
on the size of molecules under analysis[201]. The atom
(or molecules) quantity in the system determines the
time scale available to the simulation problem, hence
the time-scale problem severity [174,202]. This governs
the speed at which investigations can be conducted. The
time-scale problem is the major reason why brute-force
molecular dynamics simulations are not practical when
investigating crystal nucleation.
Virtually every computer simulation of the nuclea-
tion of crystals in liquids uses some classical nucleation
theory (CNT)[ 202,203] elements. Classical nucleation
theory was invented to deﬁne supersaturated vapours
condensation into the liquid phase although the majority
of the concepts can likewise be employed in the crystal-
lisation of supercooled liquids and supersaturated solu-
tions. It is assumed that classical molecular dynamics
simulations can handle up to approximately 105 mole-
cules on a nanoseconds or microseconds time scale.
There is a very thin set of situations for which brute-force
classical molecular dynamics simulations may be applied
to explore nucleation, and it is only typically at strong
supercooling.
Most MD simulation packages are robust and need
adequate computing power [204]. They also require a
substantial amount of time for one to familiarise them-
selves with them. Experiments are still far much superior
to simulations [202]. There have been instances where
molecular dynamics simulations have not adequately
predicted the outcome of experiments. This makes it
necessary to couple simulations with experiments.
Molecular dynamics simulations generate large amounts
of data, which intrinsically presents big data challenges
[205]. Storage, dissemination, and management of these
data in the range of terabytes are signiﬁcant even though
the capacity of storage resources is increasing[206].
It is diﬃcult to fully capitalise on the richness of data
that is oﬀered by simulations where each molecule is
indicated in atomistic detail. Simulations are usually
done with a deﬁnite scientiﬁc problem in mind, and we
often concentrate on that problem in mind during the
investigation in a stringently hypothesis-driven fashion.
Data that seem not to answer the question in mind is
usually neglected. This hinders discoveries that could
come from the neglected data.
For molecular dynamics simulation results and experi-
m e n t st oa g r e e ,t h e ym u s tb ec a r r i e do u tu n d e rt h es a m e
conditions. This may not alwa y sb ef e a s i b l es i n c es i m u l a-
tions are usually carried out under ideal conditions. Several
variables may be present when conducting experiments.
The reliability of the simulation software used can
pose a challenge to amateurs and people who have
recently started the molecular dynamicsﬁeld of study
[35]. One needs to be thoroughly vexed with all the avail-
able software, their application, strengths, and weak-
nesses. The simulation software quality relies on the
attention with which it was built and tested by its devel-
opers and their understanding of the molecular models
and algorithms incorporated in their software. Testing of
simulation packages is usually done on numerous levels
within diverse communities of researchers[35].

3.4 DFT and MD use by non-specialists
DFT and molecular dynamics simulations use complex
software that require adequate time for one to learn. A
general appreciation of DFT and MD methodologies is not
adequate for one to start using these simulation tools, as
this may lead to wrong results. Users of these methodol-
ogies must have a coding background, or must at least
learn a few coding languages such as python. There are
various tutorials accessible from the Internet where one
can get started. Non-specialists should seek assistance
from DFT and MD specialists if they have to apply these
tools in their work.
4 Conclusion
Computational modelling and simulation methodologies
are very powerful tools for analysing microstructures and
nanostructures. They complement ALD experiments but
have the advantage of signiﬁcantly reducing theﬁnancial
burden of doing experiments. Their other beneﬁt is that
they can be used to analyse very complex structures and
reactions that may be otherwise very dangerous to con-
duct experimentally in the lab. Through simulations, any
problem can be interrogated regardless of practical lim-
itations inhibiting experiments, including hypothetical
situations that could not be realised through experiments
under any conditions. However, it should be noted that
computer simulations rem ain a theoretical approach
whose value lies when new hypotheses and predictions
generated can then be subjected to experimental analysis
and validation. DFT can be applied in molecule binding
energy calculations in chemistry and the solids band struc-
ture in physics, for computing the electron density, and for
determining the many-electron system properties. DFT can
answer problems of understanding material properties in
surface science and catalysis, semiconductors, supercon-
ductors, and molecular electronics. Molecular dynamics
can be used to interpret biochemical data on repressor–
operator binding, interpret biophysical data on membrane
properties, reﬁne structures based on nuclear magnetic
resonance, reﬁne structures based on crystallographic
X-ray or neutron diﬀraction data, and predict structural
and free energy changes. Molecular dynamics can pre-
dict the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of mate-
rials. Several papers have been published where these
simulation techniques managed to predict the outcome
of experiments successfully. One must be able to distin-
guish between the discussed methodologies and pick
the relevant one for their application. These methodol-
ogies can be used to prove and validate results from
experiments and predict the outcome from experiments.
Most MD and DFT simulation packages are robust and
need adequate computing power. Substantial time is
required for one to learn the software and produce accu-
rate simulation results. Since the simulation results do
not always agree with experimental results, it is impor-
tant to couple simulations with experiments where pos-
sible. Computational modelling and simulations suc -
cesses greatly outweigh their challenges.
