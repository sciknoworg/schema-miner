ABSTRACT: We investigate the blocking layer formation of the
trimethoxypropylsilane small molecule inhibitor (SMI), its blocking
mechanisms, and all relevant blocking layer disintegration reactions
on SiO
2
in the area-selective atomic layer deposition of Al
2
O
3
with
density functional theory-based methods. The choice of amorphous
silica (a-SiO
2
) surface models proves to be essential for obtaining
the correct SMI chemistry. We demonstrate that complete blocking
of reactive sites is possible here and deduce an upper SMI density
limit of the resulting blocking layer that is limited by Pauli repulsion.
The SMI adsorption process can nevertheless leave unreacted silanol
groups, which could be remedied by using a second monodentate
SMI. The SMI layer is inert against neither common aluminum
precursors nor the co-reactant water as our comprehensive analysis
of the various blocking layer disintegration reactions for different SMI layer densities shows. We report a new blocking mechanism of
the SMI layer and propose to differentiate what is discussed as the “steric blocking” effect into the known “adsorption prevention”
effect and the newly found “reactivity reduction” effect. For trimethylaluminum (TMA), an additional favorable SMI layer
decomposition mechanism is found compared to that of the bulkier triethylaluminum (TEA), which could explain the lower
selectivity of TMA found experimentally. Our computational work offers some principles and ideas for future experiments to
improve selectivity in area-selective atomic layer deposition processes.
1. INTRODUCTION
With many dependent industries and the ubiquity of modern
electronic commodities, semiconductor manufacturing has
long been a key technology of the 21st century with
applications ranging from integrated circuits to solar cells.
1
In view of the climate crisis, the steadily growing demand poses
challenges that can partly be addressed by the downsizing of
features toward novel nanopatterned devices to reduce the
energy required for manufacturing and use.
2
Despite its
transition to ever shorter wavelengths, photolithography
technology today represents a bottleneck in terms of
manufacturing capacity and feature size reduction down to a
few nanometers.
3
Therefore, the development of alternative
bottom-up fabrication techniques yielding patterned ultrathin
films while qualifying for high-volume manufacturing has
sparked greater interest in the scientific community and
industry.
4−6
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has potential in the field, as
it allows for the fabrication of conformal layers of a variety of
materials on diverse substrates with angstrom-level thickness
control. This is achieved by applying the cyclic processing of
precursor and co-reactant molecules using self-limiting surface
reactions.
7
In addition, the method has long been extended to
achieve surface-selective material deposition, termed area-
selective ALD (AS-ALD). AS-ALD processes might allow for
the application of ALD in the manufacturing of complex three-
dimensional devices of the future, where several types of
materials are present at the same time and surface-selective
material deposition must be achieved.
1,8
The idea of AS-ALD (Scheme 1) is to deposit material on
the growth surface (GS) while sparing the non-growth surface
(NGS). To achieve this, the chemical properties of the
respective substrate surfaces need to be exploited.
1
The most
versatile strategy at the moment uses inhibitor molecules
selectively binding to the NGS. Thereby, the NGS is shielded
against precursors and co-reactants, which allows for broad
implementation in various AS-ALD systems.
1,8
The first class
of inhibitors used belongs to the class of self-assembling
monolayers (SAMs) that consist of a reactive head group
tuned to selectively bind to the NGS and a large tail group to
achieve a dense blocking layer on the NGS.
9,10
Although SAMs
have been shown to ensure high selectivity over many cycles

for various ALD processes, the disadvantages comprise their
low volatility, often impeding gas phase application, and
imprecise feature alignment at the GS/NGS interface.
11,12
Accordingly, the level of interest in small molecule inhibitors
(SMIs) has increased over the past few years. Essentially, the
structure of SMIs is similar to that of SAMs, except for
significantly shorter tail groups, which means that volatility is
increased and the level of unintentional GS blocking is
reduced.
13
The successful application of SMIs to ensure high
selectivity over many ALD cycles necessitates fine-tuning of
both the SMI and the precursor molecules to the respective
GS/NGS combinations.
8,14,15
Several classes of SMIs have
been proposed in the past, including methoxysilanes,
14
methanesulfonic acid,
16
acetylacetone,
17
aminosilanes,
18
ani-
line,
19
and ethanethiols.
12
Implementing SMI-based AS-ALD technologies in elec-
tronics manufacturing offers the promise of processing a wide
variety of materials. Among the candidates for dielectric
materials, Al
2
O
3
is a promising option for its excellent
combination of a high dielectric constant, high permittivity,
and high stability.
20
A recent joint experimental and theoretical
study
14
investigated AS-ALD of Al
2
O
3
on copper as the GS
and silicon oxide as the NGS. Therein, the selectivity of the
process was analyzed in terms of its dependence on the head
and tail groups of alkoxysilane SMIs and the bulkiness of the Al
precursors. Among the studied SMIs, trimethoxy(propyl)silane
(TMPS) was performing best. It was shown that the number
(n) of reactive methoxy groups in the set of investigated SMIs
Si(OMe)
n
R
n−1
was decisive, with n = 3 in TMPS showing the
best performance, while variation of the alkyl group (R =
methyl, ethyl, or propyl) only marginally influenced the
blocking capability. This finding highlights the difference
between SAMs and SMIs. Both families of inhibitors show
“steric blocking” of the incoming precursor as well as “chemical
passivation” of the reactive groups at the surface as blocking
mechanisms.
21
For SAMs, steric blocking is the major
mechanism,
9
while for SMIs, the chemical passivation plays
the most important role.
17
Some questions in the theoretical investigation of TMPS as
the SMI remained unanswered: the significantly better
blocking capacity of trifunctional over bifunctional alkoxysi-
lanes and the reason for the improved selectivity of
triethylaluminum (TEA) over trimethylaluminum (TMA).
We will show that answering these questions reveals
significantly new insights into blocking and decomposition
mechanisms for AS-ALD with SMIs, which has implications far
beyond the one system studied here in detail.
One main difference in our previous modeling approach
compared to experiment, and most other studies in the
literature, was in the surface model. While the experiment uses
amorphous SiO
2
, a vast majority of computational studies,
including ours, use crystalline surface models, mostly α-quartz
(Figure 1c) for the simplicity of modeling.
22
The amorphous
nature of the silicon oxide substrate complicates theoretical
studies because it does not show a strictly periodic arrange-

ment, yet key structural aspects of the α-quartz surface deviate
strongly from those of amorphous silica (a-SiO
2
). Most
obvious is the difference in Si−OH groups at the surface,
the reactive silanol groups that are the major site for ALD
growth on SiO
2
. The value of 9.34 Si−OH groups per nm
2
for
α-quartz is more than twice the experimentally determined
averaged maximum of 4.9 Si−OH groups per nm
2
for a-SiO
2
.
23
Moreover, the α-quartz model contains only two distinguish-
able surface silanol species (Figure 1c), which are both geminal
silanols. In contrast, a-SiO
2
features several individual silanols
(Figure 1a,b) with unique chemical environments, which has a
strong influence on reactivity.
24,25
Thus, using the α-quartz
model for a-SiO
2
could lead to the absence of essential features
of the surface reactivity as we will show in this study.
Recently, there has been more evidence that simplified
models deviating from the reality of amorphous surfaces used
experimentally hinder the microscopic understanding of AS-
ALD processes. For example, Sandupatla et al. showed that the
absence of reactive bridge oxygen (RBO) species, whose
frequent occurrence must be assumed in the case of sintered
silica surfaces, prevents the understanding of relevant side
reactions during the deposition of Al
2
O
3
.
26
Furthermore, an
amorphous silicon oxide model was used in a combined
theoretical and experimental work by Suh et al., studying the
area-selective deposition of ZrO
2
by competitive adsorption.
27
Another important experimental observation in AS-ALD
that has not been tackled from a theoretical perspective is the
diminishing selectivity in SMI-based approaches with the
number of ALD cycles. Usually, the blocking of the NGS is
found for only 10−50 cycles.
1,13
It is currently not clear what
the key mechanisms for this selectivity loss are. Several
chemical reactions could be responsible, like interactions of the
SMI with a precursor molecule and a co-reactant or thermal
decomposition of the SMI layer. This information currently
cannot be accessed by experimental methods and warrants a
first-principles computational treatment.
Herein, we present the first comprehensive study of AS-ALD
on a-SiO2
2
investigating the SMI layer buildup process and
various mechanisms driving the progressive disintegration of
the blocking layer (Scheme 1). We reevaluate the chemistry of
TMPS on a set of a-SiO
2
slab models in contrast to the
crystalline slabs. A nonheuristic approach is derived to infer the
best stabilized blocking layer configurations for different Si−
OH densities, resulting in several SMI layer models at full Si−
OH coverage. From these considerations, a theoretical upper
SMI layer density limit is determined and understood by
energy decomposition analysis for extended systems. The full
coverage models are used in a comprehensive mechanistic
study determining the most plausible blocking layer decom-
position reactions. Herein, we compare the reactivity of TMA
and TEA, incorporating the effect of the blocking layer density
on the observed activation barriers. In addition, the relevant
chemistry of the blocking layer with the co-reactant water is
studied.
The results of this study highlight that the blocking layer is
not a chemically inert phase and provide hints about how
modification of the SMIs before or during the AS-ALD
experiment could enhance the selectivity of SMI-based
processes.
2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
2.1. Computational Details. The Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional with the D3(BJ)
28,29
dispersion correction was used
for density functional theory (DFT) calculations involving periodic
boundary conditions. All calculations were carried out without spin
polarization. Calculations of surface reactivity were conducted with
the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, version 5.4.4).
30−32
A plane wave cutoff of 550 eV was chosen within the projector-
augmented wave (PAW) approach,
33
and a Gaussian smearing of 0.05
eV was used.
34
The plain wave cutoff, the vacuum gap thickness, and
the k-point grid have been converged up to an individual inaccuracy
of <1.5 kJ mol
−1
for the adsorption energies of several TMPS
configurations on a-SiO
2
. The reciprocal space was sampled by a Γ-
centered (2 × 2 × 1) grid generated via the Monkhorst−Pack division
scheme.
35
The wave function and the forces were converged up to
10
−7
eV and 10
−2
eV Å
−1
in single-point (SP) and geometry
optimization (GO) calculations, respectively. Initial guesses of the
minimum energy paths (MEP) of the investigated reactions were
obtained by the image-dependent pair potential (IDPP) method,
36
and a nudged-elastic-band with climbing-image (CI-NEB) meth-
od
37,38
was used to converge the MEP to a force criterion of 2 × 10
−2
eV Å
−1
. The transition states (TS) were then refined with the Dimer
method
39
by converging the wave function and forces up to 10
−9
eV
and 5 × 10
−3
eV Å
−1
, respectively. To examine the imaginary modes
of the TS and for the calculation of Gibbs energies at typical ALD
conditions (T = 180 °C; p = 133.3 × 10
−6
bar), numeric frequencies
were calculated by finite differences with a displacement of 0.01 Å and
a self-consistent field (SCF) criterion of 10
−7
eV. The TS was
reoptimized until only one imaginary mode remained, which was
ignored in the calculation of Gibbs energies. A conjugate gradient
force optimization engine was used throughout this work, except for
the CI-NEB runs, in which the FIRE algorithm
40
was used.
Two pseudoamorphous slab models were adopted from a previous
study.
26
In this study, the models had been created by truncating a
SiO
2
glass model. A vacuum layer was introduced, and the cell
parameters were chosen to fit the density of a-SiO
2
. The resulting slab
was reacted with H
2
O to form terminal Si−OH groups, resulting in
two models with distinct Si−OH densities. Lastly, the models were
annealed in a molecular dynamics (MD) experiment and further
subjected to GO. Thus, both slabs share the same basic framework
and unit cell parameters: a = 1.072 nm, b = 1.104 nm, and α = β =
90°. They differ in their silanol densities (Figure 1). The silanol-rich
amorphous silica model (A.1) contains six surface silanols, and the
silanol-reduced amorphous silica model (A.2) possesses four surface
Si−OH groups and an RBO species. A vacuum layer of 10 Å was
introduced in the z-direction corresponding to the topmost atom in
each calculation to prevent interactions due to the periodic boundary
conditions. Although this model shows periodicity, we will refer to it
as an amorphous surface model as it represents the major features of
an amorphous SiO
2
surface.
The energy decomposition analysis method using periodic
boundary conditions (pEDA)
41,42
was carried out using the BAND
program shipped with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite.
43
Γ point only
calculations were conducted with 10
−7
× √(number of atoms) × E
h
as the wave function convergence criterium. A TZ2P basis set was
chosen. Except for the electrons from the outermost shell, all electrons
were subjected to the frozen-core approximation. Moreover,
relativistic effects were considered through the scalar relativistic
ZORA approach.
44,45
The employed methodology of combining ab initio DFT with the
semiempirical DFT-D3 dispersion correction method allows for
convenient decomposition of any calculated energy into the electronic
(ΔE

) and dispersion (ΔE
disp

As shown in eq 1, ΔE
int
itself is composed of an electronic
[ΔE
int
(elec)] and a dispersion [ΔE
int
(disp)] term:
= + E E E(elec) (disp) int int int
(3)
In the pEDA, ΔE
int
(elec) is decomposed into three well-defined
terms
= + + E E E E(elec ) int elstat Pauli orb
(4)
where ΔE
elstat
represents the quasiclassical electrostatic energy of the
fragments, Pauli term ΔE
Pauli
accounts for the destabilization due to
the Pauli exclusion principle, and ΔE
orb
signifies the energy gain
through charge transfer and polarization due to relaxation of the wave
function in the final step of the analysis. For a detailed derivation and
discussion of the terms, see ref 46.
If not stated otherwise, the calculation formula of the total energy
(ΔE) employs the gas phase energies of all non-covalently bound
species, reactants, and products alike. Exemplified for the reaction of a
TMPS molecule with the A.1 slab, the reaction formula to derive ΔE
is
+ + + nA.1 TMP S (A.1 TMPS ) methanol gas gas
(5)
where n is 1−3 depending on the number of condensation reactions
undergone and bonds formed.
Coherently, ΔE is calculated as
= + + E E n E E E(A. 1 TMPS) (me thanol) (A .1) (TMPS) gas gas
(6)
Throughout the paper, we discuss ΔE in the same terms used for
discussing enthalpies of reaction. The term “endothermic” applies to a
positive ΔE, and “exothermic” to a negative change in total energy.
Furthermore, we use an indexed “R” to mark the reaction energy
= E E E R P I

where an intermediate state “I” reacted to a product “P”

2.2. Strain Energy Penalty for Multiply Bonded SMI Species.
There is a stress induced in the silica surface when bonding to the
same SMI in a bidentate or tridentate fashion. As an additional tool to
quantify the reactivity of two or three individual silanol groups to bind
to one TMPS yielding a doubly bonded (DB) or triply bonded SMI
(TB) motif, we estimate the introduced strain to the surface as an
energy penalty to the reaction energy following Scheme 2. According
to Scheme 2b, the TB bonding penalty (ΔE
TB‑pen
) is calculated as
= E E E(TB re sidue) (re laxed mod el) TB pen
(9)
Although not explicitly determined in this work, calculation of the
DB bonding penalty (ΔE
DB‑pen
) would be analogous to that of
ΔE
TB‑pen
.
2.3. Nomenclature. The prefixes A.1 and A.2 denote the
amorphous slab models according to Figure 1. Free surface Si−OH
groups are addressed by O and a number sign (#); e.g., A.1-O1
indicates the Si−OH group at O1 position on A.1 (Figure 1a).
Surface-bonded SMI configurations are identified by O, followed by
the number of bonding positions, e.g., A.2-O:245 (Figure 2a,c). In
case sets of surface-bound SMIs are addressed, the respective bonding
positions are separated by a slash, e.g., A.1-O:123/56/4 (Figure 2b,d).
The following colors apply to the elements throughout the
publication: green for aluminum, black for carbon, white for
hydrogen, red for oxygen, and blue for silicon.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The discussion is organized in three sections. In section 3.1,
the reactivity of a single SMI is discussed. On the basis of the
thereby gained knowledge, models for SMI blocking layers are
derived in section 3.2. In section 3.3, the possible
decomposition mechanisms of these blocking layers through
aluminum precursors and water are discussed.
3.1. Reactivity of a Single SMI Molecule. Initially, the
chemistry of a single TMPS molecule on a-SiO
2
is evaluated
because the knowledge of the likely SMI configurations is
fundamental to understanding the SMI layer buildup process.
In the previous study conducted on the α-quartz slab, TMPS
has been found to form a precursor state (PS) by
chemisorption, whereupon the singly bonded (SB) and DB
configurations may arise in two subsequent condensation
reactions (Figure 3c).
14
This chapter now shows the SMI
chemistry for the amorphous models.

Figure 3a provides an overview of the energetics. Starting
with reaction I ending in PS, the chemisorption is on average
slightly stronger on A.1 than on A.2. The adsorption energy
(eq 1) shows that this stems from an increased dispersion
contribution (ΔE
disp
), while the electronic energy contribution
(ΔE
elec
) is slightly less stabilizing on A.1 than on A.2. The less
negative ΔE
elec
value is a direct effect of the higher Si−OH
density on A.1, leading to a shorter distance between the
surface Si−OH groups (Figure 3b). Consequently, the
hydrogen bond (H-bond) network in which most surface
silanols are involved is also stronger. As the PS is formed by
establishing an H-bond to one methoxy group of TMPS, an
inter-silanol H-bond needs to be broken. Thus, the energy
necessary to break the stronger H-bonds on A.1 to form the PS
results in a positive shift of the ΔE
elec
values.
This is also reflected in the comparably weaker bonding for
the chemisorbed configuration found on the previously
investigated Q.1 surface [ΔE (ΔE
elec
/ΔE
disp
) = −73 (−20/−
53) kJ mol
−1
].
14
Here, the H-bond network is composed of
two kinds of very strong H-bonds (Figure 3b). Hence, the
penalty on ΔE
elec
to the chemisorption is much higher
compared to that of the amorphous slabs, leading to an
overall less stabilized PS.
Next, we discuss the SB configurations of TMPS on a-SiO
2
(reaction II in Figure 3c). This condensation reaction is mainly
endothermic, presupposing the removal of methanol as shown
for Q.1 previously.
14
The median reaction energy is more
positive than the respective chemisorption energy on both A.1
and A.2 and slightly lower on A.2 than on A.1. For this
reaction, the mean dispersion contribution to the SB TMPS
configurations is equal on both amorphous slabs. The slightly
lower mean electronic contribution to the reaction energy of
A.2-SB can again be attributed to changes within the H-bond
network at different silanol densities. To wit, the condensation
reaction of TMPS with the surface converts one Si−OH, which
can be an H-bond donor and acceptor at the same time, to an
oxygen species that is neither a donor nor a good acceptor of
H-bonds. Consequently, the H-bond network is more
disrupted by the condensation reaction when the Si−OH
density is higher (A.1). The on average less favorable reaction
energy observed for Q.1 (ΔE = 50 kJ mol
−1
)
14
fits this
observation. Note, however, how the spread of the A.2-SB
reaction energies is larger than the values for A.1-SB. The
reason is that the smaller the amount of Si−OH, the more the
characteristics of the specific bonding site and its embedded-
ness in the H-bond network show in the data. The more
surface Si−OH groups remain after the condensation reaction,
the more flexible the H-bond network is to adjust to the
changes invoked by the bonding of the SMI. In contrast, if the
Si−OH density is lower, it is more likely to be irrecoverably
disrupted if an especially good H-bond acceptor and donor are
replaced by an oxygen linker during the reaction. This is a
good example for the strong influence of the Si−OH density in
the computational model on the reactions observed.
Now, we examine the second condensation reaction
(reaction III in Figure 3c) leading to a DB SMI configuration.
This reaction is only slightly exothermic on A.1 and strongly
endothermic on A.2. On the one hand, this is a consequence of
the moderate decrease in ΔE
disp
to more positive values by the
removal of one methanol from the system, which reduces the
atom count and thereby the ΔE
disp
term, necessarily. On the
other hand, the contribution of ΔE
elec
to the DB SMI
configuration is strongly shifted to positive values. Whereas
ΔE
disp
is equal in both systems regardless of the remaining
silanol density of the slabs, ΔE
elec
differs strongly between both
surfaces and thus determines the trend in reaction energies. On
A.1-DB, the median reaction energy is still mostly lower than
that on the α-quartz (Q.1) reference surface, which could be

explained by the H-bond network effects discussed above.
However, the decrease in the mean electronic contribution
from A.2-SB to A.2-DB of >100 kJ mol
−1
cannot be explained
by the elimination of some H-bonds from the system. Rather,
the reason is in the structure of the DB configuration (Figure
3c) and the distribution of distances of the Si−OH groups on
the surface (Figure 3b). Inside a DB configuration, the former
Si−OH oxygen atoms now involved in the bonding to TMPS
show a distance of ∼2.8 Å. Other than A.1 and Q.1, the Si−
OH oxygen distances at A.2 are at least 1 Å greater than that
mark. To accomplish the bonding of the SMI, the underlying
silicon oxide framework needs to deform strongly in A.2 for the
oxygen atoms to enable bonding in DB. These adjustments
within the slab framework impose an energetic penalty on the
obtained DB configuration that show up in the strongly
endothermic ΔE
elec
of A.2-DB. Still, two outliers in A.2-DB are
energetically similar to most A.1-DB configurations. They
belong to the closest pair of Si−OH groups on A.2 at positions
O5 and O6. The dependency of the energetic penalty of DB
bonding motifs on the distance of the silanols is continued
below.
In conclusion, we have explored how the PS chemisorption
energies and the SB reaction energies differ from the α-quartz
reference. Mainly, we find that ΔE
elec
follows the same trend as
the Si−OH density and thereby the strength of the H-bond
network: Q.1 > A.1 > A.2. Likewise, the energetics of the DB
motif depend on the Si−OH density, as well, only that it is not
the strength of the H-bond network, but the distances between
the Si−OH groups that control whether a stable DB
configuration can be formed. All in all, it was shown that the
trends between the surface models can be understood from
simple structural arguments considering the density and
distribution of the Si−OH groups.
3.1.1. TB Bonding Motif. In addition to the variability in the
reaction energies and the occurrence of energy penalties in the
DB bonding motif, the crucial difference in the description of
the SMI chemistry is the absence of the TB bonding motif on
the Q.1 model. In contrast, a third condensation reaction step
consuming the remaining SMI methoxy group can be achieved
on a-SiO
2
slabs (Figure 2).
The generation of TB SMI configurations is unexpected on
the a-SiO
2
models, because the distances between Si−OH
groups are on average longer than on Q.1 (Figure 3b).
However, three other significant structural motifs entail the
altered chemistry of the amorphous system: (a) the surface
roughness, i.e., the presence of surface Si−OH groups from
different silica layers, (b) the non-uniform alignment of the
functional groups, and (c) the lack of crystallinity and the
reduced volumetric mass density implying a higher flexibility of
the uppermost silica layers.
Still, the overview of the total reaction energies of the
obtained TB SMI configurations in Table 1 comprises only
endothermic reaction energies that vary widely from 26 kJ
mol
−1
(A.1-O:123) to an enormous value of 529 kJ mol
−1
(A.1-O:245). Calculation of the TB formation penalty energies
(ΔE
TB‑pen
in Table 1; see Scheme 2b for the formula) reveals
that structural distortions in the amorphous slabs dictate the
energetic disparity of the TB configurations. Exemplified for
A.1-O:245, a large fraction of 459 kJ mol
−1
of the ΔE
elec
value
(546 kJ mol
−1
) can be attributed to such distortions.
Correspondingly, another portion of the high electronic
energies likely results from strain within the SMI−surface
bonds. All in all, these results, and the visualization of specific
TB structures (Figure S2), substantiate that ΔE
TB‑pen
and the
accompanying high ΔE
elec
values are due to comparably short-
range lattice deformations.
To further explore the emergence of triply bonded TMPS,
the reaction pathway of three consecutive condensation
reactions with Si−OH groups at O1, O3, and O2 (see Figure
1) to form the most stable A.1-O:123 TB configuration was
determined and thermodynamic correction terms to derive
Gibbs energies were calculated (Figure 4a). The energetic
profiles to form SB, DB, and TB proceed endothermically with
regard to the change in internal energy assuming the
desorption of methanol (ΔE
R
values of 37, 40, and 51 kJ
mol
−1
). With regard to the reaction barriers, the initial
condensation step to yield SB TMPS requires the highest
activation energy (TS I; ΔE
A
= 142 kJ mol
−1
), the formation of
the DB SMI has a comparably low-lying TS (TS II; ΔE
A
= 101
kJ mol
−1
), and the barrier height of the last reaction step lies
between the first two (TS III; ΔE
A
= 127 kJ mol
−1
).
The structural changes accompanying the bonding of TMPS
are shown in Figure 4b−h. The PS is formed by H-bond
donation of the Si−O1−H group to one of the SMI methoxy
groups (Figure 4b). TS I of the first condensation reaction
(Figure 4f) is characterized by a considerable shortening of the
Si−O
surf
distance between the reacting surface Si−OH group
and the SMI [Δd(Si−O
surf
) = −1.721 Å].
Concomitantly, a proton transfer from the surface Si−OH to
the methoxy moiety occurs, preforming the methanol leaving
group [Δd(O−H) = 0.205 Å], which is accompanied by
elongation of the Si−O bond within TMPS [Δd(Si−O) =
0.185 Å]. Consequently, the SMI silicon atom forms a
pentavalent state. These findings accurately resemble those
for the Q.1 surface.
14
Moreover, the same structural changes
accompany the formation of DB (Figure 4d) over TS II
[Figure 4f; Δd(Si−O
surf
) = −1.693 Å; Δd(O−H) = 0.461 Å;
Δd(Si−O) = 0.148 Å] and TS III [Figure 4h; Δd(Si−O
surf
) =
−1.302 Å; Δd(O−H) = 0.274 Å; Δd(Si−O) = 0.194 Å] of the
second and third condensation reactions, respectively.
The similarity to the reaction of TMPS with the Q.1 surface
given in ref 14 extends to the thermodynamic considerations.
From the large entropic contribution due to the creation of a
free methanol molecule, the overall Gibbs energy change is
exergonic, reversing the reaction energy trend (ΔG
R
= −45,
−45, and −15 kJ mol
−1
). This suggests the possibility of the
formation of TB TMPS in the experiment. An influence on the
reaction barriers can also be observed. The activation energy
decreases significantly for TS I (ΔG
A
= 132 kJ mol
−1
; ΔG
A
−
ΔE
A
= −10 kJ mol
−1
), decreases slightly for TS II (ΔG
A
= 96
kJ mol
−1
; ΔG
A
− ΔE
A
= −6 kJ mol
−1
), and increases slightly
for TS III (ΔG
A
= 135 kJ mol
−1
; ΔG
A
− ΔE
A
= 7 kJ mol
−1
).
Notably, this trend is different compared to findings in the α-
quartz surface, which could be due to the difference in surface
entropy changes for the less rigid amorphous surface. Hence,

the reaction barriers of SB and TB formation roughly equal
each other, whereas the DB SMI formation is energetically less
demanding.
The feasibility of the TMPS molecule accomplishing three
consecutive condensation reactions on a-SiO
2
to form the TB
configuration can be assessed on the basis of the following
thermochemical considerations. As a rough estimate, assuming
a typical ALD reaction temperature of 180 °C, first-order
kinetics, and a preexponential factor of the Eyring equation (κ)
of 1, the conversion rates of certain energy barriers can be
estimated for a typical combined dose and soak time of 5 min
(an example calculation is provided in the Supporting
Information). For a barrier of 135 kJ mol
−1
, the expected
conversion rate is >50%, ∼20% for a 140 kJ mol
−1
barrier, and
still ∼5% at 145 kJ mol
−1
. In the case of A.1-O:123, we can
expect conversion rates of ≥50% for all three reaction steps,
implying that the formation of TB TMPS species is feasible
during the actual ALD process. However, the formation energy
penalty of the TB SMI configuration data (Table 1) suggests
that the formation is strongly dependent on the actual bonding
location. To wit, the ΔE
TB‑pen
energy of the next most plausible
A.1-O:146 TB configuration is 117 kJ mol
−1
higher than that
of A.1-O:123, and some portion of that energy penalty will
enter and increase the activation barrier of both TS II and TS
III. Because the activation barrier of A.1-O:123 [ΔG
A
(TS III)
= 136 kJ mol
−1
] is already close to the feasible activation
barrier maximum derived above, it is very likely to find the
activation barrier of A.1-O:146 exceeding that limit [i.e.,
ΔG
A
(TS III) > 150 kJ mol
−1
]. Thus, the A.1-O:146 TB
configuration is unlikely to emerge under the typical ALD
conditions. The same holds true for the other remaining TB
configurations in Table 1, inducing even higher ΔE
TB‑pen
energies. Hence, A.1-O:123 is the most plausible and under
typical ALD conditions only possible TB configuration on A.1.
All in all, the discovery of the TB TMPS configuration
signifies that the replacement of idealized by the more realistic
a-SiO
2
models can involve qualitative changes in the observed
surface chemistry and lead to new reactions being found.
3.1.2. Reactive Bridge Oxygen Opening Reaction of TMPS.
In addition to the intended condensation reactions with the
Si−OH groups of a-SiO
2
, the occurrence of side reactions with
the RBO surface motif was tested (Figure 1b). TMPS readily
reacts with the RBO (ΔE
A
= 26 kJ mol

) in an exothermic
substitution reaction (ΔE

SB SMI and a methoxy group bonded directly to a Si surface
atom (Figure 5). Initially, this reaction path seems to be
beneficial from a conceptual point of view, because the RBO,
which is known to instantaneously react with Al precursors, is
removed from the surface and an SB SMI emerges.
26
However,
the additionally formed methoxy group could lead to further
side reactions with the co-reactant during the first water pulse,
in which the hydrolysis of that methoxy group is likely to occur
(Figure S3). This sequence of events yields a new free,
unblocked Si−OH species within the SMI blocking layer after
the inhibitor pulse. If there are no adjacent SB or DB SMIs
with correctly positioned substituents present within the
blocking layer, the newly created free Si−OH group would
become an easy target for Al precursors during the second Al
precursor pulse, initiating the growth nucleation of Al
2
O
3
. All
in all, the RBO opening side reaction is a potential cause of
selectivity loss in AS-ALD experiment.
Although the RBOs are more reactive to TMPS than the
surface silanols, it is not certain, however, whether TMPS will
get close enough to the surface for the reaction to occur.
Because the surface Si−OH groups protrude from the surface
into the vacuum and can form a PS by H-bonding to the SMIs,
it is possible that the blocking layer is built without the
occurrence of the RBO opening reaction. From this point of
view, the presence of unreacted RBOs beneath the blocking
layer is likely.
Going one step further, we find there is yet another set of
side reactions to consider for analyzing the bonding of TMPS.
This concerns the release of free methanol molecules in its
condensation reactions with the Si−OH groups. Because these
newly formed methanol molecules are also present on the
surface during the inhibitor pulse, they could undergo side
reactions both with the remaining free Si−OH groups and with
RBOs, the latter resulting again in the Si surface atom-bonded
methoxy group and a free surface silanol.
It is not within the scope of this work to establish the
likeliness of these processes, but the arguments given above
show that the presence of RBOs at the silica surface will have a
deteriorating effect on the selectivity of the process. The
discussion of the role of the RBO is extended below.
3.2. SMI Layer Buildup. 3.2.1. Toward Full SMI
Coverage. Now that the chemistry of a single SMI molecule
has been established, the next objective is the derivation of a
reasonably arranged TMPS blocking layer, which is crucial for
the inhibitory properties of the SMI-based AS-ALD approach.
To wit, full Si−OH coverage (chemical passivation) and
optimal energetic stability of the SMI blocking layer are
targeted. Through this approach, the absolute inhibitory
capacity of TMPS on silica can be disclosed.
The most important step in achieving this goal is to derive a
guideline whether, presupposing an SB SMI with a random
surface Si−OH, the formation of a DB SMI with a neighboring
Si−OH or the addition of a second SMI to the neighboring
Si−OH groups is energetically favored. Instead of directly
calculating reaction barriers for a variety of cases, we argue that
the barrier heights can be assessed from structural arguments
concerning the Si−OH distribution. This is in line with the
principle of least motion
47−49
stating that the smallest reaction
barrier is observed for a reaction showing the smallest
structural changes. In detail, we estimate that the blocking
layer assembly kinetics is made under the assumption that the
dispersion energy term (ΔE
disp
) is not decisive and can be
neglected in the discussion. Instead, the focus is solely on the
electronic part (ΔE
elec
) of the total reaction energy (eq 1). The
reason is that the reaction barrier height mainly depends on
the formation of the pentavalent TS at the SMI silicon atom,
whereas the dispersion interaction with the surface remains
nearly constant during the reaction. The other major influence
on the TS energy is the energy penalty invoked for the
neighboring surface oxygen atoms to come into the proximity.
Here the assumption is that the energy penalty to form the TS
approximately equals that of the products according to the
Hammond postulate.
In conclusion, the energetically most favorable full coverage
models are derived by minimizing ΔE
elec
by stepwise addition
of TMPS molecules.
3.2.2. Comparison of the SB/SB and DB SMI Config-
urations. Once the first SMI has reacted to afford an SB
configuration, the next step can be the formation of DB by the
same SMI or adsorption of a second SMI into another SB
configuration, leading to an SB/SB arrangement. The
comparison of DB with SB/SB SMI configurations involving
the same two Si−OH groups can be perceived as a question of
the best inter-silanol distances [d
init
(Figure 6a)] for the
respective configurations to form (Figure 6). Table S2 provides
an overview of the structural and energetic signatures for
possible DB configurations.
First, we discuss how ΔE
elec
depends on the change in
distance (Δd). This metric represents the difference between
the inter-silanol distance of the free surface (d
init
) and the
distance after the adsorption of the SMI to the DB
configuration (d
bond
) illustrated in Figure 6a. At low Δd values
(0.7−1.2 Å) ΔE
elec
quickly increases to reach a plateau at
ΔE
elec
of ≈50 kJ mol
−1
(Figure 6b). Beyond the 1.2 Å mark
(dashed line), ΔE
elec
varies greatly, with values usually
exceeding 100 kJ mol
−1
relative to that of the best stabilized
DB configuration [A.1-O:13 (Figure 4c)], a trend that is
independent of the silanol densities of the two models. The
cause is in the ΔE
DB‑pen
energy necessary to bring Si−OH
oxygens into bonding distance and due to the strain introduced
into the DB configuration. When assuming that the energy
penalty is mostly incorporated into the TS energy and hence
the activation barrier and by knowing the activation energy of
A.1-O:13 [E
A
= 101 kJ mol
−1
(TS II in Figure 4a)], we can
give a rough estimate for the reaction barriers of the other DB
configurations. At the plateau around a Δd of ≈1.0 Å, where
ΔE
elec
= 50 kJ mol
−1
, an activation barrier (ΔE
A
) of ≈101 + 50
kJ mol
−1
results, which approaches the upper boundary of
barriers we deem viable under ALD conditions. As a
consequence, as ΔE
elec
drastically increases for most config-

urations beyond a Δd of >1.2 Å, the formation of DB SMIs can
be considered unlikely beyond that mark, which corresponds
to inter-silanol distances (d
init
) of ≥4.0 Å.
Next, we discuss the alternative bonding scenario, the SB/SB
SMI configurations. Figure 6c illustrates the correlation of
ΔE
elec
with d
init
(data in Table S3). Here, the electronic
stability of the SB/SB configurations increases with d
init
. The
reversed trend is found for the dependency of ΔE
elec
on Δd
illustrated by Figure 6d. The larger the Δd, the less negative
ΔE
elec
, except for the geminal SB/SB configuration. These
trends originate in the steric repulsion of the SMIs in adjacent
bonding sites. The data show that SMIs in the proximity are
pushed apart, and the larger the separation, the smaller d
init
.
However, the stabilization through increasing the inter-SMI
distance is mitigated by the energy penalty necessary to move
the Si−OH oxygen atoms upon reaction. In other words, the
farther the Si−OH groups of an SB/SB configuration are apart
initially, the weaker the repulsion and the smaller the energy
penalty invoked to weaken the repulsion. This explains the
comparatively low level of electronic stabilization of the SB/SB
configuration formed by a pair of geminal Si−OH groups
(Figure 6c,d). The repulsion between the two inhibitor
molecules is strong, but the distance of the geminal Si−OH
groups is fixed; therefore, shifts within the slabs cannot balance
the repulsion. The repulsion and consecutive changes in the
surface are still present in the SB/SB configuration for which
d
bond
= 4.2 Å, which is larger than the d
init
at which DB
configurations are still plausible (4 Å).
In conclusion, we have found clear indications that, in line
with what chemical intuition tells us, short inter-silanol
distances favor the formation of DB configurations, whereby
two SB SMIs prefer configurations with large inter-silanol
distances.
3.2.3. Derivation of the Best Stabilized Full Coverage
Models. We will now demonstrate how the findings presented
above can be used to derive the most stable full coverage
configurations without explicit computation of all permuta-
tions. In a stepwise manner, we will increase the amount of
SMIs within the unit cell up to five SMIs and discuss the most
stable configurations.
First, the possibility of fully blocking the slab by covering all
of the Si−OH groups with just two SMIs is explored on A.2.
Full coverage means that all four Si−OH groups at the surface
are bonded to an SMI. This can be accomplished by either
forming a TB with O2, O4, and O5, and an SB with O6, or
choosing two DB configurations. However, we have already
shown that all DB and TB configurations are hindered by
energy penalties, with A.2-O:56 [d
init
< 4 Å; ΔE
elec
(A.2-O:56)
− ΔE
elec
(A.1-O:13) = 50 kJ mol
−1
] being the sole exception.
Therefore, it is unrealistic to cover A.2 with only two SMIs.
With three SMIs, the problem comes down to finding the best
DB/SB/SB combination. Indeed, picking A.2-O:56 as the only
well-stabilized DB configuration and forming two SB SMIs
with the remaining O2 and O4 positions feasibly saturate all of
the Si−OH groups. This configuration nets an exothermic total
reaction energy ΔE of −68 kJ mol
−1
(A.2-O:56/2/4 in Table
2). For four SMI molecules, the only viable configuration
consists of four SBs (A.2-O:2/4/5/6) and nets a negative ΔE

(−192 kJ mol
−1
). Trivially, finding a solution for five SMIs is
not possible for the lack of further Si−OH groups on this slab
model.
Considering next the A.1 model, having six surface silanols
adds to the complexity of the problem (overview in Scheme
S2). First, reacting all of the Si−OH groups with just two
SMIs, i.e., a stable TB/TB configuration, is not possible, as it
cannot be accomplished by any combination of the known TB
configurations in Table 1. For combinations comprised of
three SMIs, the choice is between the best DB/DB/DB and
TB/DB/SB combinations. Instead of pursuing a heuristic
approach, we make choices on the basis of our knowledge of
the bonding configurations that depend of the silanol
distances. Considering first the DB/DB/DB configuration, it
is convenient to start with O3 and O4. The pair of geminal Si−
OH groups cannot bind to the same SMI, as this would form a
two-membered Si−O ring (labeled by the number of Si atoms
in the ring), which implies a severe energy penalty in its
formation. Thus, we exclude the A.1-O:34 DB configuration.
Hence, both Si−OH groups at positions O3 and O4 need to
form DBs of their own, yielding A.1-O:3#/4#/## (here # is
used as a place holder for a yet unassigned Si−OH position).
Looking for good DB options containing O3, we find both O1
and O2 as rather close pairing partners. Forming the
energetically best combination (i.e., O:13) would leave O2
without a neighbor to form an energetically acceptable DB
configuration. Hence, we choose O:23, resulting in A.1-O:23/
4#/##. Among the remaining choices for O1, O6 is the nearest
neighbor, which leaves O5 as a good pairing partner for O4.
Thus, A.1-O:16/23/45 represents the best DB/DB/DB
configuration. Although it is slightly endothermic in energy
(ΔE = 8 kJ mol
−1
), the comparison to the next best choices
(A.1-O:13/24/56 with a ΔE of 128 kJ mol
−1
and A.1-O:14/
23/56 with a ΔE of 121 kJ mol
−1
) confirms the plausibility of
the approach, as the ΔE
elec
term is more positive by >100 kJ
mol
−1
in these cases (ΔE
elec
= 119, 252, and 242 kJ mol
−1
for
A.1-O:16/23/45, A.1-O:13/24/56, and A.1-O:14/23/56,
respectively).
The TB/DB/SB solution to saturate all of the Si−OH
groups is rather straightforward. Because O:123 is the only
viable TB configuration and O:56 is the energetically preferred
DB among the remaining surface silanols, the result is A.1-
O:123/56/4. Upon addition of a fourth SMI, A.1-O:13/56/2/
4 is the best choice conforming to the viable DB/DB/SB/SB
combination. It features the two best stabilized DB
configurations, with regard to the ΔE
elec
term [ΔE
elec
(A.1-
O:13, A.1-O:56) = −23 and 3 kJ mol
−1
(Table S2)]. Another
plausible choice, TB/SB/SB/SB, results in A.1-O:123/4/5/6
for the same reasoning as above. However, the Si−OH groups
at O5 and O6 are separated by merely 3.04 Å (d
init
). Thus,
forming SB SMIs on both positions leads to smaller electronic
contributions due to steric repulsion and the energy penalty
invoked to mitigate it [ΔE
elec
(A.1-O:123/4/5/6) = 359 kJ
mol
−1
]. For similar steric reasons, the higher-coverage
configuration A.1-O:56/1/2/3/4 (five SMIs) is energetically
unfavorable as discussed in detail in the next section.
3.2.4. Quantifying Inter-SMI Forces with pEDA. As shown
in the previous section, adding a fifth SMI molecule to the
system, increasing the SMI density to 4.2 SMIs/nm
2
, results in
a high total endothermic reaction energy of 214 kJ mol
−1
(A.1-
O:56/1/2/3/4). The reason is a vast increase in ΔE
elec
from
A.1-O:13/56/2/4 to A.1-O:56/1/2/3/4 of 531 kJ mol
−1
,
which cannot be offset by the corresponding stabilization
through dispersion by −202 kJ mol
−1
. As the progression from
A.1-O:13/56/2/4 toward A.1-O:56/1/2/3/4 involves the
replacement of the O:13 DB by two SBs, an energy penalty
is expected to occur through adjustments within the surface.
However, the effect is too pronounced to be explained by slight
conformational adjustments of the surface. Furthermore, the
strongly increased dispersion term ΔE
disp
indicates intense
inter-SMI interactions within the blocking layer.
Thus, to understand the electronic effects involved in our
different blocking layer models, we investigate the source of
destabilization by decomposing the inter-SMI interactions.
This is important because the driving forces for achieving
maximum SMI coverage are not yet well understood. To this
end, pEDA calculations were conducted on SMI layer models
[SLMs (Figure 7)], which were derived from fully covered
blocking layer models as explained in Figure S4.
Table 3 comprises the results for the SMI at position O2,
whose interactions with the surrounding SMI layer are
determined. Position O2 was chosen, as the SMI is in the
SB configuration in all of the SLMs. It hence shares the same
amount of unreacted methoxy groups in all full coverage
models. Interaction energy ΔE
int
, which shows the overall
interactions between the central SMI and the surrounding
layer, becomes more attractive with an increase in SMI density
from A.2-O:56/2/4 (−29 kJ mol
−1
) to A.2-O:2/4/5/6 and
A.1-O:13/56/2/4 (−36 kJ mol
−1
) but becomes repulsive for
the densest model, A.1-O:56/1/2/3/4 (27 kJ mol
−1
).
Therefore, the SMI interlayer interaction is most favorable at
3.4 SMIs/nm
2
. The positive value of E
int
of 27 kJ mol
−1
(A.1-
O:56/1/2/3/4) implies that the SLM would gain energy if the
fifth SMI is removed. A decomposition of the overall
interaction energy discloses the opposing trends for the
electronic ΔE
int
(elec) and dispersion interaction energies
ΔE
int
(disp). With an increase in SMI density from 3.4 to 4.2
SMIs/nm
2
, the attractive ΔE
int
(disp) approximately doubles
from −77 to −132 kJ mol
−1
, while ΔE
int
(elec) is nearly 4 times
more repulsive (40 vs 159 kJ mol
−1
). To understand this

int
(elec) is further decomposed
(see eq 3). Both electrostatic interaction ΔE
elstat
and orbital

orb
stabilize the SLM with an increase in
SMI density to −194 and −121 kJ mol
−1
, respectively. In
contrast, the destabilization based on Pauli repulsion ΔE
Pauli
is
dramatically increasing with the SMI density reaching a value
of 326 kJ mol
−1
for a density of 4.2 SMIs/nm
2
. This
observation implies that the SMIs are too densely packed for
the electrons to facilely avoid each other. Consequently, a
substantial destabilization of the interaction energy is observed,
which cannot be offset by the increased dispersion attraction.
In conclusion, the pEDA results corroborate that the TMPS
SMI has a theoretical upper SMI density limit of <4.2 SMIs/
nm
2
with Pauli repulsion being the decisive force at this limit.
3.2.5. Increasing SMI Density: Combining Mono- and
Trifunctional SMIs. During the last subsections, viable SMI
configurations and densities toward full coverage of the a-SiO
2
surface have been established. For a change of perspective, this
chapter shows an example, how the conformational freedom of
the inhibitor in its bonding configurations can lead to
incomplete silanol coverage. Subsequently, a remedy is briefly
discussed. Panels a and b of Figure 8 show two DB-O:13
conformers on A.1 that differ in the placement of the
remaining methoxy group. In Figure 8a, the methoxy groups
points toward O2, where it can form the well-stabilized TB-
O:123 configuration by another condensation reaction.
However, the methoxy group in Figure 8b points away from
O2, so that O2 remains unblocked. Adding two additional
SMIs in the energetically most favorable way to this structural
motif results in A.1-O:13/56/4. Here, DB-O:56 and SB-O:4
were selected, because TB-O:256 cannot be formed and O:24
is hindered by a strong energy penalty. Hence, O2 remains
unblocked in this surface model. Furthermore, computational
experiments to acquire either a PS or a TS with a fourth TMPS
molecule at the remaining Si−OH group at position O2 failed,
because O2 is the least accessible Si−OH of the ensemble.
Accordingly, it is not certain that the O2 group is covered by
TMPS during the blocking layer buildup process. The
comparison of the total reaction energies of both A.1-O:13
DB configurations shows that the DB configuration leading to
A.1-O:123 is more stable by 15 kJ mol
−1
, which hints that its
occurrence could be more likely. However, even a minor
presence of configurations as in Figure 8b could facilitate
growth nucleation, because free silanol groups are probably the
main source of selectivity loss during ALD experiments.
21
The
accessibility of the free O2 Si−OH group by Al precursors
TMA and TEA was checked in the A.1-O:13/56/4 bonding
scenario. Both TMA and the sterically more demanding TEA
were found to form well-stabilized precursor states with the
unblocked silanol (Figure S5).
One strategy shown by Mackus et al. in the past was to add a
second, smaller SMI to increase the Si−OH coverage and SMI
density.
19,50,51
As TMPS is itself too bulky to block O2,
whether the pulsing of another, smaller SMI could be
advantageous was tested. Panels c and d of Figure 8 show
the PS and SB state of O2 on A.1-O:13/56/4 for the
monofunctional methoxytrimethylsilane (MTMS) inhibitor.
The adsorption is exothermic (ΔE
ads
= −22 kJ mol
−1
). The
slightly endothermic condensation reaction (ΔE
R
= 6 kJ
mol
−1
) is hindered by a barrier of 151 kJ mol
−1
. Thus, the
resulting activation energy is slightly higher that that of TMPS
with the pristine A.1 surface model [ΔE
A
(TS I) = 142 kJ mol
−1
(Figure 3a)]. Therefore, an extended soak time could be
necessary for optimal silanol coverage of the second SMI.
These results show that full coverage of all Si−OH groups is
virtually impossible for one SMI. However, the combination of

different SMIs could improve the achievable silanol coverage
and thereby the selectivity of the AS-ALD process. Thus, we
propose a combination of TMPS and MTMS in AS-ALD
experiments to achieve increased Si−OH coverage and thus
enhanced selectivity.
3.3. SMI Layer Decomposition: Interaction with TMA,
TEA, and H
2
O. We now have a clear picture of how the SMI
blocking layer can build up. The chemical stability of these
layers is very important for the application of AS-ALD. We
thus investigated the possible decomposition reactions during
the ALD of Al
2
O
3
on the SMI-covered NGS silicon oxide
(Scheme 3). We focus on precursors TMA and TEA that were
used experimentally for this system.
14
Because blocking layers
of differing SMI densities were derived, the influence of the
SMI density on the reactions can be assessed. The
predominant chemistry of Al precursors is the breaking of
polar bonds in a ligand exchange reaction (LER). Therein, Al
binds to the nucleophilic bonding partner while the alkyl ligand
is transferred to the electrophilic bonding partner. In the RBO
opening reaction (Scheme 3A), the Al precursor binds to the
oxygen, and a ligand of the precursor molecule is transferred to
the now undersaturated surface Si atom. In Scheme 3B, the
Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond is broken. Al binds to oxygen, and a precursor
ligand transferred to the otherwise unsaturated Si
SMI
atom.
Scheme 3C shows the C−O bond intersection mechanism, in
which the Al precursor binds to the methoxy group oxygen
atom, while the ligand is transferred to the carbon atom.
Thereby, an alkane is formed, which leaves the surface. The
reaction shown in Scheme 3D is similar to the previous
reaction, only that the Al ligand is transferred to the Si
SMI
atom
instead of the oxygen atom. Hereby, a new Al precursor
molecule, di(m)ethylaluminum(m)ethoxide, is formed and a
second alkyl moiety remains at the Si
SMI
atom.
In addition to the Al precursor reactions, the bespoke
oxygen−silicon bonds can undergo hydrolysis with the co-
reactant water. Reaction E shows the hydrolysis of the RBO
yielding two surface silanols. Hydrolysis S of the Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond is shown in mechanism F, and the Si
SMI
−O
meth
bond can
be split by hydrolysis as shown in reaction G.
3.3.1. Role of the RBO Motif: Reactions A and E. The LER
of TMA with the RBO species of an a-SiO
2
slab was
demonstrated by Sandupatla et al. for the bare A.2 surface.
26
The reaction has been shown to exhibit a very low activation
barrier of <10 kJ mol
−1
, making it a major candidate for growth
nucleation sites during the ALD of Al
2
O
3
.
26
Moreover, in their
work, Xu et al. indicated that the mechanism of selectivity loss
in different ALD experiments on silicon oxide might be
attributed to the breaking of strained Si−O−Si bonds by the
precursor molecules.
52,53
Two questions are essential for
assessing the role of the RBO: (1) whether the precursors
can breach the blocking layer to adsorb at the RBO and (2)
whether the SMI layer can hamper the reactivity of the RBO
toward the Al precursors.
Figure 9a presents the energy diagram showing the
adsorption of TEA on the RBO and the subsequent LER
using an A.2-O:56/2/4 model (TMA is found in Figure S6).
Initially, TEA adsorbs to the top of the blocking layer (ΔE
ads,top
= −64 kJ mol
−1
) before penetrating the blocking layer with a
low intralayer diffusion barrier (ΔE
ads,A
= 11 kJ mol
−1
) and
reaching the RBO in an overall exothermic process (ΔE
ads,RBO
= −113 kJ mol
−1
). The main stabilization up to this step stems

from dispersion attraction. However, once it has arrived, the
RBO is opened instantaneously in a strongly exothermic LER
with a negligible reaction barrier (ΔE
ads,A
= 3 kJ mol
−1
),
leading to a very stable product (ΔE
R
= −232 kJ mol
−1
). Thus,
the adsorption is not effectively blocked and the reaction is not
prevented by the SMI layer. Essentially, the low intralayer
diffusion barrier is itself an effect of the RBO. As the RBO is
the result of a loss of two adjacent Si−OH groups, the local
Si−OH density around the RBO is reduced.
The computational experiment was repeated for the A.2-
O:2/4/5/6 configuration featuring a denser blocking layer of
3.4 SMIs/nm
2
. Surprisingly, neither TMA nor TEA showed a
stable adsorption state at the RBO beneath the denser SMI
layer. Furthermore, the reaction energies for the LER of the
RBO are endothermic by 116 and 88 kJ mol
−1
for TMA and
TEA, respectively (Figure S7). This means that with an
increase in the blocking layer density from 2.5 to 3.4 SMIs/
nm
2
, a strong exothermic reaction was converted into an
endothermic one. Moreover, because the reaction proceeds
without leaving groups and the TMA fragments stay in the
proximity on the surface, the reaction is reversible. Thus, even
if the activation barrier could be overcome under ALD
conditions to yield the product state, the equilibrium is clearly
shifted to the side of the reactants. Hence, although the Al
precursors might temporarily exist in the described product
form, the thermodynamically expectable outcome is the
restoration of the reactant state. Ultimately, because the
adsorption at the RBO itself is endothermic, the desorption
and purging of the Al precursors are highly likely during the
purge phase. Therefore, even if a reaction of an Al precursor
with the RBO takes place, it does not affect the selectivity of
the process observed after a whole AS-ALD cycle at a
sufficiently high blocking layer density. In other words, even if
the chemical passivation of the initially present surface groups
is not complete by the end of the inhibitor pulse, the thereby
achieved SMI blocking layer density might still suffice to
prevent side reactions through steric blocking.
All in all, this finding is consistent with the conclusions
drawn from the pEDA on the SLM. Increasing the SMI layer
density from 2.5 to 3.4 SMIs/nm
2
decreases the interaction
energy of the SMIs, but with a further increase in the SMI layer
density to 4.2 SMIs/nm
2
, a positive, destabilizing contribution
is found. Likewise, adding TMA or TEA to a blocking layer
already containing four SMIs per unit cell evokes strong
repulsive forces, eventually preventing the intrusion of the Al
precursors into the blocking layer (Table S4 and Figure S8).
Thus, we draw the conclusion that the loss of selectivity
through the RBO opening reaction can be prevented if the
SMI layer density is maximized, yet as the existence of the
RBO decreases the local silanol density, all TMPS molecules
need to form SB configurations in our example to achieve the
maximum SMI layer density of 3.4 SMIs/nm
2
on the A.2
model, which is quite improbable.
To circumvent the side reaction through LER at RBO
altogether, an approach for removing the RBO before the
application of TMPS in the inhibitor pulse was computation-
ally explored. To determine whether the co-reactant water
could be utilized to replace the RBO by two Si−OH groups,
the reaction of A.2 with water to form A.1 was modeled
(Figure 9b). With a low reaction barrier (E
A
) of 27 kJ mol
−1
,
the approach is feasible, as the RBO is nearly as reactive to the
water co-reactant as to the Al precursors. Moreover,
considering the strongly exothermic reaction energy (ΔE =
−150 kJ mol
−1
), the inverse reaction has a high activation
barrier (E
A
+ ΔE = 177 kJ mol
−1
). As a side effect, the newly
generated Si−OH groups can help in the bonding of the SMIs
during the subsequent inhibitor pulse. This finding conforms
with the results of recent experiments that corroborate the
importance of appropriate surface hydroxylation through the
pulsing of water to ensure the desired surface reactivity toward
the precursor molecules.
54
In summary, pulsing water before
the inhibitor should be considered to enhance the selectivity of
the AS-ALD process.
3.3.2. Degradation of the Si
SMI
−O
surf
Bond: Reaction B.
Whereas the RBO can be considered a surface artifact, whose
occurrence might be circumvented by process optimization,
the next reactive bond to be investigated is the fundamental
Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond constituting the SMI blocking layer (Scheme
3B). Decomposition of the Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond by LER results in
a surface-bound Al species that has a direct impact on
selectivity as it constitutes an ALD nucleation site. Moreover,
the Al species might undergo secondary reactions to adjacent
Si
SMI
−O
surf
bonds, further undermining the blocking layer and
possibly detaching SMIs from the surface. A gap would form
within the blocking layer, allowing other Al precursors to
penetrate, facilitating the growth of Al
2
O
3
, yet the occurrence
of this decomposition pathway is necessarily preceded by the
adsorption of the Al precursor through the blocking layer to
the silicon oxide surface. The adsorption energies of TMA and
TEA at the Si
SMI
−O
surf
bonds of a single SMI and within a
blocking layer with 2.5 SMIs/nm
2
(A.1-O:123/45/6) are
shown in Figure 10. TEA is slightly more strongly bonded than
TMA (on O1) in both cases, and the bond becomes stronger
for the higher SMI density (Figure 10b). This counterintuitive
result stems from an increase in the level of dispersion
interaction for TEA, while for TMA, covalent bonding
contributions as well as dispersion interaction increase. For
higher SMI densities, no stable adsorption structure of either
Al precursor is found due to a strong increase in Pauli
repulsion.
Next, we examine the reaction barriers for LER. We find
moderate barrier heights on the isolated SMI (ΔE
A
) of 93
(TMA) and 105 kJ mol
−1
(TEA) (Figure 10a). Thus, the LER
of the Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond represents a major threat to the
selectivity of the AS-ALD process at low SMI densities, yet
upon comparison of these results with the LER at the same O1
position at a higher blocking layer density of 2.5 SMIs/nm
2
(Figure 10b), the activation barriers are more than twice as
high for both precursors [ΔE
A
values of 190 (TMA) and 217
kJ mol
−1
(TEA)]. This hints at a previously unknown third
inhibition mechanism of the blocking layer. It can enhance the
activation energies of specific reaction mechanisms for the
ALD precursors.
The rationale for this finding is in the spatial demand of the
pentavalent TS at the Si
SMI
atom (Figure 11b). As the
precursor ligand approaches the Si atom, its propyl group and
any remaining methoxy groups need to make room for the new
bonding partner. They are displaced in the process, which can
invoke repulsive forces within the blocking layer. In a general
sense, the denser the blocking layer and the larger the ligands
of the Al precursors, the stronger the forces acting against the
displacement of the SMI’s substituents. However, due to the
amorphous nature of the underlying silicon oxide substrate and
the resulting irregularity of the blocking layer configuration, the
intensity of this effect will vary among the different adsorption
sites and the various SMI layer configurations. Nevertheless, it

7355


should be a general mechanism also for other SMIs and ALD
precursors.
In addition to the O1 physisorption site at A.1-O:123/45/6,
TMA was found to possess another, just barely exothermic
adsorption site at O4 of A.1-O:123/45/6 (ΔE
ads
= −9 kJ
mol
−1
), where TEA would not adsorb (Figure 10b). Evidently,
the lower bulkiness of TMA entails a larger number of possible
adsorption sites beneath the SMI layer. Because of the very
weak adsorbate stabilization at O4 and because the TS energy
for the LER of TMA with O4 is less endothermic than for the
reactions at O1 (83 kJ mol
−1
vs 93 kJ mol
−1
), a moderate
activation barrier (E
A
) of 92 kJ mol
−1
results. Thereby, TMA
possesses an additional reaction channel that can be active
even at a rather high blocking layer density of 2.5 SMIs/nm
2
. A
comparison of the respective reaction energies further
substantiates this observation. Considering the LER at O1,
the reaction energy with TMA is slightly exothermic (ΔE
R
=
−4 kJ mol
−1
), whereas the same reaction is strongly
endothermic with TEA (ΔE
R
= 89 kJ mol
−1
). This finding
can be attributed to the different amount of repulsion invoked
within the blocking layer by both Al precursors.
As a final remark, note that the especially low reaction
energy of TMA at the O4 position (ΔE
R
= −125 kJ mol
−1
) is
not caused by altered repulsion interactions within the
blocking layer. Instead, it is rather affected by the stability of
the specific SMI−surface bond configuration, i.e., the energy
penalty released by the LER of multiply bonded SMIs. For
example, upon comparison of the bonding positions O1 and
O4 of A.1-O:123/45/6, the LER at O1 reduces the TB-O:123
to the still moderately strained DB-O:23 configuration,
whereas the full amount of ΔE
DB‑pen
is released when DB-
O:45 is reduced to SB-O:5 by LER at O4 (Table S2). These
general trends apply irrespective of the immense variance in
the results caused by the amorphous nature of the silica
substrate.
All in all, our findings corroborate the notion that the low-
growth inhibition seen with TMA is partly due to its lower
steric hindrance when adsorbing to O
surf
atoms. Additionally,
the product configurations of reaction type B are more likely to
be favored over the adsorbate structures when the reaction is
conducted with TMA, whereas the trend is reversed with TEA.
Thus, our results reveal yet another novel aspect of the
dependency of the reactivity of Al precursors on their ligands
in AS-ALD experiments. Moreover, these results have several
implications for not only the choice of the precursor but also
our understanding of fundamental processes during AS-ALD
experiments. The capacity of the blocking layer is not solely
defined by its ability to hinder the penetration of precursor
molecules or by covering of the Si−OH groups. Instead, it has

become clear that the blocking layer reduces the reactivity of
the Al precursors with the Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond as compared to the
isolated SMI (1) by stabilizing the precursor, (2) by enhancing
the TS energy, and (3) by moving to more endothermic ΔE
R
values.
This is fundamentally a steric effect as it depends on the size
of the precursor ligand, but it is different from what is known
in the literature as “steric blocking”, which means that the SMI
layer prevents the precursor from reaching the surface at all. In
our case, the precursor reaches the surface, but the SMI layer
limits further reactivity. Depending on the SMI coverage and
ALD precursor, one of the two effects dominates. We thus
propose to split up the term “steric blocking” in the context of
AS-ALD with SMIs into an “adsorption preventing” effect (the
previously discussed effect) and the new “reactivity reduction”
effect.
Furthermore, the determination of the Si
SMI
−O
surf
disinte-
gration mechanism provides one explanation for the
accelerated loss of selectivity experimentally observed for
TMA. The LER of the SMI−surface bond potentially separates
SMIs from the surface, undermining the blocking layer in the
process, whereby more Al precursors may breach the blocking
layer over time.
14
3.3.3. Reactivity of Unreacted Methoxy Substituents:
Reactions C, D, and G. In addition to the occasional RBO
and the fundamental Si
SMI
−O
surf
bond, another oxygen species
that could lead to side reactions during AS-ALD is prevalent in
the blocking layer in the form of unreacted SMI methoxy
groups. As these groups cover most of the inter-SMI space
(Figure S4c), exothermic chemisorption of the Al precursors
and the co-reactant to the SMI−methoxy groups is found to be
independent of the SMI layer density (Figure S10). From these
adsorption sites, two reaction pathways are conceivable with
diametrical outcomes with regard to the selectivity of AS-ALD.
In the first mechanism, an LER of the C−O bond splits the
methoxy group (Scheme 3C). This results in an SMI−oxygen-
connected precursor fragment, while ethane (TMA) or
propane (TEA) is formed. Because the mechanism yields an
SMI layer-bonded aluminum fragment, this could diminish the
selectivity of the ALD process. In the second mechanism, the
methoxy groups are substituted for the Al precursor ligand
(methyl or ethyl), and a di(m)ethylaluminum(m)ethanoxide
molecule is formed as the leaving group (Scheme 3D). In
contrast to the former reaction pathway, this mechanism could
be highly beneficial for the selectivity of the AS-ALD process,
because it replaces the reactive methoxy groups with inert alkyl
groups and ejects the Al species from the surface.
Figure 12 shows the activation barriers calculated for both
mechanisms and Al precursors. Different SMI layer densities
ranging from a single isolated SMI to full coverage models with
SMI layer densities of 2.5 and 3.4 SMIs/nm
2
were considered.
Illustrations of the TS structures of both reaction pathways are
provided in panels c and d of Figure 11 for the A.1-O:13/56/
2/4 blocking layer configuration (3.4 SMIs/nm
2
).
Considering reaction C, ΔE
A
increases with SMI layer
density for both TMA (ΔE
A
values of 179, 206, and 207 kJ
mol
−1
) and TEA (ΔE
A
values of 160, 193, and 197 kJ mol
−1
).
Overall, ΔE
A
varies more strongly for the sterically more
demanding TEA than for TMA, yet because its activation
barrier is smaller at the isolated SMI and at both SMI layer
densities, TEA can be considered the more reactive Al
precursor in reaction C. However, all activation barriers exceed
150 kJ mol
−1
, wherefore the reaction mechanism is unlikely to
occur under ALD conditions.

−1
) and
TEA (ΔE
A
values of 115, 155, and 203 kJ mol
−1
). Again, the
variance of ΔE
A
is more pronounced for TEA than for TMA.
Moreover, the SMI layer density has an overall stronger
influence on reaction D than on reaction C. The trend of
reactivity is not as clear. At the isolated SMI, the ΔE
A
value of
TMA is 16 kJ mol
−1
lower than that of TEA. Note how the
trend is reversed at 2.5 SMIs/nm
2
. Here the TS of TEA is
better stabilized by −17 kJ mol
−1
. Considering finally the ΔE
A
values at 3.4 SMIs/nm
2
, the TS of TMA is better stabilized by
−30 kJ mol
−1
. All in all, reaction D is more likely to occur
under ALD conditions than reaction C. With (more or fewer)
isolated SMIs on the surface and with ΔE
A
values of <130 kJ
mol
−1
, reaction D is likely to occur for both TMA and TEA
under the given ALD conditions. However, at an SMI layer
density of 2.5 SMIs/nm
2
, the reaction barriers of TMA and
TEA are already too high to exist under the given ALD
conditions. Hence, neither reaction C nor reaction D is likely
to influence the outcome of the AS-ALD experiment, if a dense
SMI blocking layer has been acquired during the inhibitor
pulse.
As we have pointed out in our discussion of disintegration
reaction B and as one can see from our previous analysis of
reactions C and D, the SMI layer increases ΔE
A
with an
increase in density. Upon comparison of reactions C and D in
this regard, the influence of the SMI layer density on the ΔE
A
value of bulkier TEA is larger than that of the smaller TMA
precursor. Moreover, the SMI layer density more strongly
influences reaction D (88 kJ mol
−1
for TEA) than reaction C
(37 kJ mol
−1
for TEA). These trends can be understood when
comparing the structure of the TS of both reactions (Figure
11c,d). In the case of the C−O bond intersection (reaction C),
the TS shows the small CH
3
group being transferred from the
methoxy oxygen to the Al precursor alkyl ligand. On the
contrary, the Si
SMI
−O
meth
intersection mechanism (reaction D)
entails the approach of the Al precursor to form a pentavalent

TS at the Si
SMI
center. Thereby, the groups present at the Si
SMI
atom are displaced, and this displacement invokes repulsive
forces within the surrounding SMI layer depending on the
local SMI layer density. The same rationale applies to the
comparison of the Al precursors. The approach of the larger
ethyl ligand of TEA to form the pentavalent TS necessitates a
larger displacement of the SMI-bonded groups than what is
required for the smaller methyl ligands of TMA. The smaller
the displacement necessary, the smaller the SMI layer effect on
ΔE
A
. Hence, the SMI layer effect is less pronounced for TMA
than for TEA. Thus, the presented data corroborate our
previous conclusions about the effect of the SMI layer on
reactions happening within it. The higher the spatial
requirements of a TS, the more pronounced its destabilization
by the SMI layer. This could be used as a design strategy.
In addition to the precursor chemistry, the reaction of the
co-reactant H
2
O with the SMI methoxy group (Scheme 3G)
was studied. The TS barrier heights are compiled in Figure
12b. With ΔE
A
values of 97, 112, and 106 kJ mol
−1
from the
lowest to highest SMI layer density, the activation barriers are
roughly equal and show no clear trend regarding the SMI layer
effect. This finding is well within the scope of our explanation
given above. Because the water molecule is very small, the
spatial requirement of the TS is also comparably small.
Therefore, the repulsive forces induced within the SMI
blocking layer that could destabilize the TS will be very small.
All in all, the results from the analysis of the SMI methoxy
group chemistry could have several implications for the AS-
ALD process. As the ΔE
A
values of reaction G are well below
130 kJ mol
−1
, unreacted methoxy groups will be converted to
hydroxyl groups during the first water pulse. Hence, as the
methoxy groups have been removed, OH groups are present
during the following precursor pulse. The gas phase reaction
data presented in ref 14 suggest that these OH groups are very
reactive to the Al precursors. Thus, the hydroxyl groups will
react with the Al precursor molecules during the following
precursor pulse, which leads to SMI-bound Al precursor
fragments [as in reaction C (Table S5)]. Although this feature
is not yet fully understood, we expect a negative impact on
selectivity. As a solution to this problem, understanding the
role of the precursor fragments and investigating possibilities
to replace methoxy groups after the SMI deposition by more
inert groups are expected to be valuable future research
questions for alkoxysilane SMIs. Another promising mod-
ification to investigate, which could prevent the emergence of
Si
SMI
−OH groups altogether, might entail the replacement of
water as the co-reactant by alcohols as a provider of oxygen
atoms.
55,56
In conclusion, the methoxy groups of the SMI layer
were found to be mostly inert to the Al precursors due to the
SMI layer effect. Instead, the data suggest that the methoxy
groups might be converted into more reactive hydroxyl groups
during the first water pulse.
3.3.4. Cross-Linking of SMIs. In ref 14, it was hypothesized
that another benefit of the TMPS SMI over the mono- and
bifunctional inhibitors could be in the cross-linking reaction of
surface-bound SMIs with unreacted methoxy groups remaining
within the blocking layer (Figure S4b). In the following, the
feasibility and blocking capacity of the cross-linking bonding
motif are evaluated for the amorphous surface.
In ref 14, it was shown that the direct cross-linking reaction
of two SMIs each bearing a methoxy group is hindered by a
very high activation barrier (ΔE
A
= 255 kJ mol
−1
). Hence, the
cross-linking of SMIs is dependent on the presence of hydroxyl
groups at the surface-bound SMIs under ALD conditions.
Therefore, the reaction is only viable during or after the first
water pulse.
14
Panels a and b of Figure 13 show a potential
cross-linking reaction between DB-O:13 and SB-O:2 in the
A.1-O:13/56/2/4 configuration, where two of the remaining
methoxy groups have been replaced by hydroxyls. The reaction
is slightly endothermic by 7 kJ mol
−1
, with a moderate reaction
barrier of 106 kJ mol
−1
. Thus, the cross-linking of SMIs is an
equilibrium reaction. Whether the reactants or products are
favored depends on the presence of water in the system. To
wit, during a water pulse, the cross-linking of SMIs is likely to
be reversed (i.e., shifted toward the reactants, if the
concentration of water is high). On the contrary, the link is
likely to be reestablished during the subsequent vacuum phase
considering the entropic contribution from the resulting water
molecule.
Following that reasoning, the cross-linked SMI layer is more
likely during the precursor pulse. To examine whether the
cross-linked structure can enhance the blocking capacity, its
reactivity toward the bulkier TEA precursor has been
calculated (Figure 13c,d) at an SMI layer density of 3.4
SMIs/nm
2
. With an activation barrier of 127 kJ mol
−1
, the
cross-linking bond is not stable against the Al precursors.
However, with a reaction energy of just −1 kJ mol
−1
and with
the products staying in the proximity, the reaction is reversible.
Therefore, the reaction is likely to be shifted to the side of the
reactants reestablishing the cross-linking bond during a
vacuum phase, because the Al precursors are subtracted from
the surface.
All in all, we can conclude that although the cross-linking of
SMIs is a realistic bonding motif between the surface bound
SMIs, there is no impact on the selectivity of the AS-ALD
process.

4. CONCLUSIONS
We investigated computationally the SMI blocking layer
buildup process with TMPS on an amorphous silica substrate
and analyzed its blocking behavior against the Al precursors
TMA and TEA with water as the co-reactant. TMPS can
undergo three subsequent condensation reactions with the
amorphous surface model, which explains its improved
inhibition against ALD growth compared to mono- and
bifunctional alkoxysilanes. The existence of the TB TMPS
configuration signifies that the replacement of the idealized
form by the more realistic a-SiO
2
models can involve
qualitative changes in the observed surface chemistry. From
these findings, optimized SMI configurations at full Si−OH
coverage were designed and a theoretical upper SMI density
limit of 4.2 SMIs/nm
2
given by Pauli repulsion was derived.
We illustrated that the pulsing of TMPS alone does not
necessarily lead to full Si−OH coverage and demonstrated that
subsequent pulsing of a second, monofunctional alkoxysilane
inhibitor could further optimize the silanol coverage.
Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of the possible
reactions of the Al precursors within the SMI blocking layer
was given. Thereby, a reaction path disintegrating the SMI
surface bond was found that can explain the loss of selectivity
over time. It has become clear that the SMI blocking layer is
not inert but subject to many modifications by both the Al
precursors and the co-reactant water during the ALD process.
We found the reactive bridge oxygen to be very reactive to the
Al precursor and the co-reactant. It could thus lead to free,
unblocked Si−OH groups by an undesirable side reaction with
the SMI, and we propose the pulsing of water prior to the
inhibitor pulse to remove that source of side reactions from the
surface.
The detailed computational analysis of this exemplary
combination of an SMI, a non-growth surface, a precursor,
and a co-reactant provides a plethora of general mechanisms
and insights that will be transferred and generalized to other
systems relevant for area-selective atomic layer deposition in
the future. Most notably, we show that the SMI layer blocking
ability is not solely through the chemical passivation of OH
groups and steric blocking of diffusion paths to the surface.
Beyond that, the SMI layer influences the reactant, product,
and transition state energies by the “reactivity reduction” effect
of the reactions happening within it. We thus propose to talk
about “adsorption prevention” and “reactivity reduction” as
steric blocking effects in AS-ALD with SMIs. The higher the
spatial requirements of a transition or product state and the
denser the SMI layer density, the higher the resulting energy
penalty. Hence, achieving the highest obtainable SMI layer
density in combination with spatially demanding precursors
and co-reactants is the key to ensuring area selectivity over
many cycles in SMI-based AS-ALD experiments.
