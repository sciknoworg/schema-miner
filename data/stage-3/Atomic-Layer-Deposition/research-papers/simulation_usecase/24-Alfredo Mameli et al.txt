lectronic device fabrication g enerally requires several
lithographic steps to obtain well-aligned features. This is
becoming ever more challenging in the semiconductor industry
as feature dimensions of state-of-the-art devices keep shrink-
ing.1−4 It is, however, not only the semiconductor industry that
faces such challenges. Some of the challenges in patterning for
nanoelectronics share common ground with those of microscale
patterning as used in large-area electronics. Furthermore,
removing material by etching can be detrimental in terms of
materials damage and contamination.5 Moreover, for large-area
electronics cost per unit and throughput considerations also limit
the use of expensive and iterative“litho-etch” steps. This holds,
for example, for patterned transparent conductive oxides
(TCOs).6−8 TCO ﬁlms are ubiquitous in many devices such as
displays,9−12 solar cells,13 and solid state lighting and sensors,7,8
including those based on emerging organic light-emitting devices
(OLEDs)14 and on halide perovskite materials. To date, methods
used for patterning TCOs such as such as rapid laser patterning15
often have limited uniformity and resolution or suﬀer from
material degradation during the etch processes.6 Furthermore,
more than six steps are typically required to fabricate patterned
TCOs.6−8,16 Hence, several applications that require millimeter
and submillimeter patterned TCOﬁlms would beneﬁt from the
availability of alternative patterning methods.9−12
Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) has emerged
as a promising solution to push device manufacturing toward
new frontiers. Signiﬁcant eﬀorts, in academia and industry, are
currently devoted toward the development of AS-ALD
techniques that can be incorporated within existing fabrication
schemes. To date, most of these eﬀorts have been inspired by the
need to prepare nanoscale features in the semiconductor industry
as an alternative or a possible solution for extremely complex
lithography schemes. Although the number of viable methods is
still very limited, the approaches for achieving AS-ALD can be
categorized as (1) area deactivation, in which a part of the surface
is rendered inert toward a speciﬁc ALD process, and (2) area
activation, where conversely, an inert surface is locally activated
for a speciﬁc type of ALD chemistry.17−19 A prototype example
of theﬁrst case is area deactivation of a surface by blocking it with
self-assembled monolayers.2,20,21 A particular case of the latter
approach is the direct activation of a surface region without any
subtractive steps. This can be referred to asdirect-write
ALD,2,18,22 and it enables patterning and ALD to be combined
into a truly bottom-up process drastically reducing the number of
required fabrication steps. One embodiment ofdirect-write ALD
was developed by Mackus et al. by exploiting the catalytic activity
of a Pt seed layer grown locally using electron beam induced
deposition (EBID). After EBID, ALD was applied for selectively
thickening the Pt seed layers into high-quality Pt nanostruc-
tures.2,18,22
In this work, we present a novel method for AS-ALD which
targets the preparation of microscale features relevant in large-
area electronics. It is adirect-write ALD process of In2O3:H, a
highly promising and relevant TCO material,23 which makes use
of printing technology for surface activation. As schematically
depicted in Figure 1, ﬁrst the surface of H-terminated silicon
materials is locally activated by aμ-plasma printer in air or O2,24
and subsequently In 2O3:H is deposited selectively on the
activated areas. The selectivity stems from the fact that ALD
In2O3:H leads to very long nucleation delays on H-terminated
silicon materials.25 In this work it is demonstrated that this
method allows for preparing microscale In2O3:H features in a
true bottom-up approach on surfaces of H-terminated Si(100), a-
Si:H or a-SiNx:H with the In2O3:H material quality being as high
as for blanketﬁlms.26 This novel approach fordirect-write ALD of
In2O3:H holds therefore potential for applications in large-area
electronics which make use of patterned TCOs such as displays
and solar cells.
For the experiments an Oxford Instruments Opal ALD reactor
was used to deposit the In2O3:H ﬁlms. Indium cyclopentadienyl
(InCp) served as indium precursor and a mixture of H2O and O2
as coreactants.27 A standard recipe was employed as detailed
elsewhere.23,27
The reactor pressure was∼150 mTorr throughout the cycle
with a pressure spike of∼200 mTorr during the 20 ms H2O dose.
All samples prepared in this study were deposited at 100°C.
Films of a-Si:H and a-SiNx:H on p-type Si(100) served as
substrates. These 10 nm thickﬁlms were prepared by inductively
coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICP-CVD) from
SiH4 and Ar at 50°C and from SiH4 and NH3 at 80°C for a-Si:H
and a-SiNx:H, respectively. Alternatively, H-terminated Si(100)
was prepared by dipping the wafer in diluted (1 vol %)
hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) for 2−3 min.28 Furthermore, a 400μm
thick stainless steel foil with 20 nm of a-Si:H on top was used as a
ﬂexible substrate.
After preparation, the surfaces were locally activated by aμ-
plasma printer developed by the company InnoPhysics. The

print-head of thisμ-plasma printer consists of actuated needle
electrodes in a multi needle-to-plate dielectric barrier discharge
conﬁguration.24 It allows varying the patterning width by setting
the number of actuated needles and achieving high throughput
(1 cm2 in less than 5 s). For this study air and O2 plasmas at
atmospheric pressure were used to locally activate the surface of
the silicon based materials.
By carrying out the sequence of local plasma activation and the
ALD cycles as illustrated inFigure 1, the area-selective deposition
was demonstrated for a macroscopic pattern on a large area.
Figure 2a shows a 4-in. wafer covered with 10 nm a-Si:H onto
which a patternedﬁlm was prepared byμ-plasma printing and
400 ALD cycles. This resulted in∼35 nm thick In2O3:H locally
deposited as measured by ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)
at two diﬀerent angles (65 and 75°, using an M-2000D system
from J. Woollam Co. with photon energy range of 1.2 to 6.5 eV).
The selectivity of the process was conﬁrmed by XPS measure-
ments using a Thermo Scienti ﬁc K-Alpha system probing
distinctive points inside and outside the patterned area. The In
3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 signals for two of such points are shown in
Figure 2b. High signals were collected on the patterned area
whereas a negligible signal was measured outside the pattern.
This demonstrates the excellent selectivity reached, even after
400 ALD cycles. This ﬁnding was substantiated by I−V
measurements within and between the diﬀerent letters ofFigure
2a (seeSupporting Information, Figure S3).
The patterning capabilities of the μ-plasma printer were
subsequently investigated using three active needle combinations
to pattern lines which were 3.0, 0.8, and 0.6 mm in width. This is
done by actuating 12, 4, and 3 needles, respectively, yielding the
result inFigure 3a. All three patterns are shown in Figure S1b in
the Supporting Information. The material at the surface was
probed by XPS through line scans across the 3.0 and 0.8 mm wide
lines. The XPS spot size was 400μm, and the distance between
successive sampling points was 600μm. For clarity, only the
atomic percentages of In and O bonded to In (Figure 3b) and Si
(Figure 3c) are reported. The complete XPS data, together with
the results on a-SiNx:H, are shown in Figure S2 of theSupporting
Information. The XPS line scans reproduce the patterns inFigure
3a as atomic percentages of In and O, while the Si atomic
percentage was observed to be complementary to the In2O3:H
signals. The In atomic percentage decreased from a maximum of
∼30% inside the pattern area toward 0% in between the patterns,
again demonstrating the high selectivity of the ALD process. The
result also demonstrates the capability of theμ-plasma printer to
pattern microscale features on a large-area substrate. The
smallest achievable feature size is∼200 μm with the current
version ofμ-plasma printer, and this can be achieved by actuating
one needle (seeSupporting Information).
It was also veriﬁed that the area-selective processing does not
aﬀect the material properties as compared to full blanketﬁlms.
The resistivity of the In2O3:H patterns was measured using a
four-point probe station on 3 mm wide patterns. In this case the
patterns were prepared on a wafer with 450 nm thick thermal
SiO2 and 10 nm a-Si:H. The In2O3:H prepared by thedirect-write
ALD process had a resistivity of 0.59 mΩ·cm, which corresponds
well with results obtained for blanketﬁlms.25 In addition the
microstructure of theﬁlms probed by cross-sectional SEM was
found to be comparable to what obtained for blanket ﬁlms
(Figure S4).
As mentioned at the beginning of this communication, the
selectivity of the In2O3:H ALD process is stemming from the fact
that very long nucleation delays are obtained on H-terminated
Figure 1.Schematic representation of the area-selective ALD process of In2O3:H on H-terminated silicon materials. In theﬁrst step (1), microscale
patterns are deﬁned by activating the surface with aμ-plasma operated in air or O2. In the second step (2), the In2O3:H is deposited selectively on the
activated areas in a building step. The ALD process consists of two alternating half reactions: InCp precursor dosing in pulse A and a mixture of O2 and
H2O dosing in pulse B. Note that in the case that conductive substrates are used, a thin dielectric membrane (Al2O3) is positioned between the needles
and the substrate, as shown inFigure S1a.

thickness of the In2O3:H was∼35 nm. (b) XPS signals for the In 3d5/2

surfaces of silicon materials whereas the nucleation delay on
oxide surfaces is considerably shorter as shown inFigure 4.25 To
elucidate the role of the surface groups during ALD of In2O3:H,
ﬁrst-principle calculations have been carried out using density
functional theory (DFT) 29,30 with the Perdew −Burke −
Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional.31,32 van der
Waals interactions were also accounted for on an empirical
basis.33 Additional computational details can be found in the
Supporting Information Section 1.4. The structures and
associated relative energies have been calculated for the
stationary points along the anticipated reaction pathways for
the chemisorption of the InCp precursor and proton transfer
from the substrate to the Cp ligand of the precursor. This was
done for (1) hydrogenated silicon and (2) hydroxylated silicon
oxide surfaces, as these are expected to represent the H-
terminated and plasma activated surfaces to a good approx-
imation. The reactions considered are therefore
−* + → −* +Si H InCp Si In HC p (1)
−* + → − − * +SiO H I n C p S iOI n H C p (2)
where the asterisks indicate the surface species involved in the
reactions.
Figure 5 shows the corresponding energies obtained by the
DFT calculations. The results reveal that Reaction 1 is
endothermic and requires an energy input of 0.31 eV to proceed,
with associated activation energy of 0.36 eV. ForReaction 2, the
activation energy of 0.28 eV is slightly lower, and in contrast to
Reaction 1, the overall process is exothermic.
Based on the Arrhenius equation, assuming the prefactor is
similar in magnitude for both surface reactions, this diﬀerence in
activation energies translates into an∼13-fold higher rate for
Reaction 2in comparison toReaction 1at the ALD temperature
of 100°C. Moreover, the proton transfer reaction forReaction 2
is exothermic and releases energy (0.30 eV). By contrast,
Reaction 1 requires an energy intake of 0.31 eV to take place,
such that Reaction 2 likely proceeds with a much higher
probability.34
The predicted reaction energies therefore point to the
thermodynamically favored nature of InCp binding on the
hydroxylated SiO2 surface as opposed to the H-terminated
silicon. This can explain the high selectivity that can be reached

cycles on a-Si:H. Above 600 ALD cycles the selectivity of the process
appears to degrade.

for the area-selective ALD process of In2O3:H on activated and
nonactivated surfaces of H-terminated silicon materials.
In conclusion, a novel direct-write ALD process has been
demonstrated for In2O3:H, a highly relevant TCO material. By
combining local activation of H-terminated surfaces of silicon
materials by aμ-plasma printer and AS-ALD of In 2O3:H,
microscale patterns can be generated in a true bottom-up
process. Excellent selectivity and low resistivity of the In2O3:H
were demonstrated. The method therefore provides bright
prospects for large-area applications because both theμ-plasma
printing and the AS-ALD process are scalable. Large-area
applications employingﬂexible substrates such as OLED displays
and ﬂexible photovoltaics are of particular interest due to the
current trend toward printing technology and roll-to-roll ALD
processes.35−37 Therefore, as aﬁrst demonstrator, thedirect-write
ALD process was employed on aﬂexible stainless steel foil with
20 nm thick a-Si:H as is shown inFigure 6. Transferring the
technology to printing on ﬂexible substrates combined with
spatial ALD processes will be the next steps. Also the extension of
the process to other substrate materials and ALD materials
systems will be considered. Other ALD precursors that undergo
similar surface reactions can possibly also be used to develop
area-selective ALD in a few cases.28,34,38 Finally, we note that
preliminary investigations using a focused electron beam have
yielded promising results with respect to the extension of the
currentdirect-write ALD process of In2O3:H toward nanoscale
dimensions.
