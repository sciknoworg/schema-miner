Abstract
Density functional theory is employed to investigate atomic layer deposition (ALD) mechanism of HfO 2 on hydroxylated SiO 2 surface
using HfCl 4 and H 2O as precursors. The ALD process involves two alternate deposition half-reactions: (1) HfCl 4 with the SiO 2–OH*
surface site, and (2) H 2O with the SiO 2–O–HfCl* surface site. Combined potential energy surface and intrinsic reaction coordinate stud-
ies show that both the half-reactions proceed through an analogous trapping-mediated mechanism and a similar transition state. By com-
parison of the reaction energies of precursors on diﬀerent size model surfaces, we ﬁnd that the cluster size has a major eﬀect on the HfCl 4
half-reaction, especially on the formation of HfCl 4 chemisorbed complex, as compared to the H 2O half-reaction. We also ﬁnd that the
intermediate stability is lowered as the surface temperature is raised, which in turn results in desorption increasing of adsorbed
precursors.

1. Introduction
With the continued scaling of silicon complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), the traditional gate
dielectric SiO2 will reach its physical limitations where
the leakage current through the insulator is a serious prob-
lem[1,2]. As a result, the replacement of SiO 2 by high- k
oxide as gate dielectric is inevitable to increase capacitance
density and suppress electron tunneling[3,4]. In particular,
HfO2 has recently emerged as one of the most promising
alternative dielectric materials due to its relatively high per-
mittivity and good thermal stability [3,5–7].
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique shows its
unique ability in depositing ultra thin ﬁlms with excellent
conformity and uniformity over large areas. Especially it
is becoming a dominating deposition method for high-k
gate dielectrics nowadays [8,9]. In ALD, each precursor is
pulsed to the reaction chamber alternately, and the reac-
tion between the incoming precursors and surface species
is self-terminating. Thus atomic level control of ﬁlm
growth is achieved. ALD has been actively investigated
for deposition of HfO2 using HfCl 4 and H 2O as precursors
[10,11].
Experimental results have shown that the starting silicon
surface is critical in initiating growth and assuring unifor-
mity for ALD grown high-k ﬁlms. Also, the properties of
the ﬁlm strongly depended on the composition of the ﬁlm
in the interfacial region between the high- k oxide and the
silicon substrate. For instance, an interfacial layer of
SiO2 only one or two molecular layers thick can beneﬁt
to channel mobility although the total capacitance is low-
ered compared to the pure HfO2 [12–14]. It is thus critical
to understand the initial reactivity of each precursor on
SiO2 surface. Recently, certain ﬁrst principle studies have
started to focus on the initial growth mechanism of ALD
of HfO 2 on SiO 2 surface. In particular, Este `ve et al. [15]

and Jeloaica et al. [16] have studied the HfCl 4 initial reac-
tions on SiO 2 surface using the transition state (TS) search
algorithm of bond constraint relaxation (BCR). However,
Han et al.[12] have referred that the BCR method is limit-
ed in nature due to its unable to fully explore the whole
potential energy surface (PES) of the system to locate the
TS. Although Han’s studies [12] are on the reaction mech-
anism of ALD of ZrO 2, the results can still be compared in
our current work due to the similarity of HfO 2 and ZrO 2.
Although some ﬁrst principle studies of ALD of HfO 2 on
SiO2 surface have been reported, to our knowledge, the
thermochemistry and kinetics of SiO 2 surface reactions still
need to be explored in detail, such as temperature and clus-
ter size eﬀects based on diﬀerent basis sets and calculated
methods. In addition, the PESs of the reactions of HfCl 4
and H 2O on SiO 2 surface mentioned above have been
explored only in stationary points. In our current study,
the continued PES of the Si(OH)3–OH surface reaction will
be described using the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)
method[17], which can conﬁrm the correct TS connecting
reactants to products. In addition, to ensure that the TS of
the larger clusters Si(OSiH3)3–OH and Si 9O3H12–H–OH
are not artiﬁcial, the vibrational mode corresponding to
the only imaginary frequency and the selected bond lengths
closely related to the TS will be compared with those
obtained using the small cluster Si(OH)3–OH.
In this study, the detailed initial reaction mechanism of
HfO2 on hydroxylated SiO 2 surface by ALD using HfCl4
and H2O precursors will be intensively studied. The ALD
of HfO2 cycle is achieved through two sequential half-reac-
tions, i.e. HfCl 4 and H 2O half-reactions. The reaction
sequence explored in this study is described as:
SiO2–OH/C3 þ HfCl4 ! SiO2–OHfCl/C3
3 þ HCl ðR1Þ
SiO2–OHfCl/C3
3 þ H2O ! SiO2–O–HfCl2–OH/C3 þ HCl
ðR2Þ
where the asterisks denote the surface species. Reaction 1
belongs to the HfCl 4 half-reaction, representing the reac-
tion of surface hydroxyl with the precursor HfCl 4 molecule,
and reaction 2 belongs to the H 2O half-reaction, in which
H2O reacts with the surface hafnium species.
2. Computational models and methods
To investigate the ALD of HfO 2 on SiO 2 surface, three
diﬀerent size model clusters, i.e. Si(OH) 3–OH,
Si(OSiH3)3–OH and Si 9O3H12–H–OH clusters ( Figs. 1 a
and c), are employed, in which the central silicon atom
has one OH surface active site and bonds with three oxygen
atoms. The smallest cluster Si(OH) 3–OH is used to explore
the reaction mechanism of HfCl 4and H 2O adsorption and
decomposition on SiO 2 surface in order to minimize the
expensive time-consuming for IRC method. The largest
cluster Si9O3H12–H–OH is modeled by a Si 9H12 one-dimer
cluster authorizing the presence of a single surface dimer
unit to account for the Si(100)-2· 1 reconstruction. The
Si9H12 one-dimer cluster consists of four layer silicon atoms
where the top two silicon atoms compose the surface dimer.
The remaining seven silicon atoms compose three subsur-

face layers that are hydrogen terminated to prevent unreal-
istic charge transfer. Three oxygen atoms are systematically
introduced within Si–Si bonds at the surface and upper sub-
surface in Si9O3H12–H–OH cluster. The structures of these
model clusters will be fully optimized in all calculations.
The hybrid B3LYP method, as implemented in GAUSS-
IAN 03 [18], has been employed in all calculations, incorpo-
rating Becke’s three parameter exchange functional [19,20]
and the Lee–Yang–Parr gradient-corrected functional
[21]. A mixed basis set scheme is used to minimizing the
computational time. The LANL2DZ basis set and eﬀective
core potential for hafnium atom and a diﬀuse double-zeta
plus polarization 6-31+G(d) basis set for the chemically
active atoms, i.e. the central surface silicon and oxygen
atoms as well as all the atoms of the precursors HfCl 4 and
H2O, and 6-31G basis set for the other silicon and terminat-
ed H atoms are used in every calculation. The geometry is
optimized by ﬁnding stationary points followed by frequency
calculations needed to verify the nature of the stationary
points on the PES, including energy minima (all positive
frequencies) and transition states (one imaginary frequency).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction path for the adsorption and decomposition of
HfCl4 on SiO 2–OH surface (R1)
The PES of the reaction of HfCl 4 with Si 9O3H12–H–
OH* surface site is shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding
energy values are given in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 2,
HfCl4ﬁrst adsorbs molecularly onto the Si–OH* surface
site to form a stable chemisorbed complex with an
adsorbed energy of 73.1 kJ/mol. Widjaja et al.[22] have
suggested that a similar complex HfCl 4(a) is formed
through the interaction between the oxygen lone-pair elec-
trons coming from the surface hydroxyl group and an emp-
ty d-orbital of the hafnium atom. Next, the reaction
proceeds through a four-center TS, then one chlorine atom
of the adsorbed HfCl 4 recombines with the hydrogen atom
of the surface OH group to form HCl, and then the gaseous
HCl desorbs. The activation barrier for the HCl formation
is 64.2 kJ/mol relative to the chemisorbed complex
HfCl4(a). A stable physisorbed HCl with a desorption ener-
gy of 10.5 kJ/mol uphill relative to the physisorbed state
has been found due to the hydrogen bonding interaction
between hydrogen atom of HCl and the neighboring
bridged oxygen atom of the –Si–O–Si– species, denoted
by O /C1/C1/C1 H–Cl (R1). The distance of O /C1/C1/C1 H is 1.68 A˚ , which
is within eﬀective hydrogen bonding interaction distance,
and the bond length of H–Cl is 1.34 A˚ , which is slightly
lengthened as compared to the isolated HCl molecule
(1.29 A˚ ). This suggests that in the actual experiments the
bridged oxygen atoms can eﬀectively adsorb the by-prod-
uct HCl and make the remove of HCl more diﬃcult. In
addition, calculations show that the initial HfCl 4 half-reac-
tion is energetically favorable, having a lower activation
barrier for dissociation than that for desorption. Thus
the reaction tends to move toward the product rather than
to be trapped in HfCl 4(a) adsorbed state.

decomposition on the Si 9O3H12–H–OH* surface. The
H2O half-reaction follows a similar trapping-mediated
pathway as the reaction of HfCl 4 on Si 9O3H12–H–OH*
surface site. Gaseous H 2O exposes on the surface sites
and forms a stable chemisorbed complex exothermically
by 54.6 kJ/mol (Table 1 ). Similar to the HfCl 4(a) chemi-
sorbed complex in the HfCl 4 half-reaction, the H 2O(a)
chemisorbed complex is also formed owing to the dona-
tion of the oxygen lone-pair electrons of H 2O into an
empty d-orbital of the hafnium atom. It should be noted
that for the HfCl4 and H 2O half-reactions, the lone-pair
electrons come from the oxygen atoms of the Si–OH*
surface site and H2O precursor molecule, and the hafni-
um empty d-orbitals come from the HfCl 4 precursor mol-
ecule and Si –OHfCl/C3
3 surface site, respectively. HCl is
then formed through the recombination of the hydrogen
atom of H 2O and the neighboring chlorine atom of Si–
OHfCl3 group. Relative to H 2O(a) chemisorbed complex,
the activation barrier for HCl formation is 78.9 kJ/mol.
Similarly, a weak physisorbed complex HCl(a) with a
desorption energy of 1.2 kJ/mol uphill relative to the
physisorbed state has also been found in the H2O half-re-
action. The physisorbed complex HCl(a) is also due to
the hydrogen bonding interaction, denoted by O/C1/C1/C1 H–Cl
(R2). The distance of O /C1/C1/C1 H (1.87 A˚ ) is longer and the
bond length of H–Cl (1.31 A ˚ ) is shorter than those in
O/C1/C1/C1 H–Cl (R1), which suggests that the physisorption
of HCl molecule in H 2O half-reaction (R2) is weaker
than that in HfCl 4 half-reaction (R1). Finally, the reac-
tion is overall weakly exothermic by 0.7 kJ/mol.
3.3. Cluster size eﬀects
Compared with the reaction of HfCl 4 with Si 9O3H12–
H–OH* surface site in HfCl 4 half-reaction, the reactions
of HfCl 4 with Si(OH) 3–OH* and Si(OSiH 3)3–OH* surface
sites resulted in a 4.2 and 15.1 kJ/mol lower formation
energy for the HfCl4(a) chemisorbed complex, a 0.3 and
/C0 1.8 kJ/mol higher activation barrier relative to HfCl 4(a)
chemisorbed state for the TS, and a 3.2 and 13.2 kJ/mol
lower overall reaction energies, respectively (Table 1 ).
The three initial HfCl 4 half-reaction are all energetically
favorable, having lower activation barrier for dissociation
on hydroxylated SiO 2 surface. And compared to the reac-
tion of H 2O with Si 9O3H12–H–OHfCl/C3
3 site in H 2O half-
reaction, the reactions of H 2O with Si ðOHÞ3–OHfCl/C3
3
and Si ðOSiH3Þ3–OHfCl/C3
3 sites resulted in a 2.3 and
4.2 kJ/mol higher formation energy for the H 2O(a)
absorbed complex, a 0.3 and /C0 0.3 kJ/mol higher activa-
tion barrier relative to H 2O(a) chemisorbed state for the
TS, and a 0.3 and 4.2 kJ/mol higher overall reaction ener-
gies, respectively. We ﬁnd that both HfCl 4 and H 2O half-
reactions based on the middle size cluster Si(OSiH 3)3–OH
and the large size cluster Si 9O3H12–H–OH show small dif-
ference in energies, which is not enough to alter the
growth rate. And for the small size cluster Si(OH)3–OH,
it shows obvious diﬀerence for HfCl 4 half-reaction and
small diﬀerence for H 2O half-reaction in energies. In other
words, the cluster size eﬀects are slightly stronger for the
HfCl4 half-reaction than those for the H 2O half-reaction,
especially for the formation of the chemisorbed intermedi-
ate complex. The weak cluster size eﬀects in the H2O half-
reaction can be explained: the ﬁrst hafnium monolayer
resulting from the deposited HfCl4 prevents the incoming
H2O from interacting with the SiO 2 surface. Despite the
obvious cluster size eﬀects for the half-reaction of HfCl 4
with Si(OH) 3–OH* site, the shape of PES of the
Si(OH)3–OH surface reaction is qualitatively similar to
those of the Si(OSiH 3)3–OH and Si 9O3H12–H–OH surface
reactions ( Fig. 2 ), which indicates that all the three sur-
face reactions proceed through an analogous trapping-
mediated mechanism. Therefore, the small cluster model
Si(OH)3–OH is employed to investigate qualitatively the
selected bond lengths variation along IRC in order to
minimize the computational time.
3.4. Selected bond lengths variation along IRC
It is well known that the IRC, the steepest descent path
from the TS, is generally used to assess which TS connects
reactants to products. However, IRC is very computation-
ally demanding, so the small cluster model Si(OH)3–OH is
employed to describe the HCl elimination path of HfCl 4(a)
and H 2O(a) chemisorbed complexes in detail. Because the
small size may aﬀect the quality of the results, the calculated
Fig. 3. Reaction path and predicted energetics for reactions of H 2O on the
Si(OH)3–OHfCl3, Si(OSiH 3)3–OHfCl3 and Si 9O3H12–H–OHfCl3 surface
sites. The corresponding energy values are also listed in Table 1 .

results are compared to those obtained using the middle-
size Si(OSiH 3)3–OH cluster and the large-size Si 9O3H12–
H–OH cluster. For the three TSs, i.e. Si(OH) 3–OH–HfCl4
(S), Si(OSiH 3)3–OH–HfCl4(M) and Si 9O3H12–OH–
HfCl4(L), the optimized structural parameters closely relat-
ed to the four center TS show so much similarity, which has
been compared as followed: Hf–O, Hf–Cl, Cl–H, O–H
bond distances (A ˚ ): 2.04(S)/2.02(M)/2.03(L), 2.78(S)/
2.84(M)/2.82(L), 1.48(S)/1.48(M)/1.48(L) and 1.35(S)/
1.34(M)/1.34(L);\Hf–O–H, \O–Hf–Cl, \Hf–Cl–H,
\Cl–H–O bond angles ( /C176 ): 89.6(S)/90.3(M)/90.7(L),
65.7(S)/64.8(M)/64.9(L), 61.3(S)/58.7(M)/60.3(L) and
143.4(S)/146.1(M)/144.1(L). In addition, the imaginary fre-
quencies related to three TSs all correspond to the O–H
stretch vibration. Therefore, the Si(OH) 3–OH can qualita-
tively be used to simulate SiO 2 surface and study the reac-
tion pathway using IRC method. It should be noted that
recently Han[12] have obtained the reasonable calculated
results of ALD of ZrO 2 on SiO 2 surface based on
Si(OH3)–OH small model.
Along the IRC for the elimination of HCl from
Si(OH)3–OH–HfCl4 complex, a plot of the changes in
selected bond lengths close related to TS structure is shown
in Fig. 4. In this work, the minimum energy paths were cal-
culated using IRC method in mass-weighted cartesian
coordinates with a step size of 0.05 (amu)1/2 bohr. The
mass weighted distance along the reaction coordinate is
denotedS, in which the TS located at S = 0 (amu) 1/2 bohr.
In the course of the reaction, the breaking Hf–Cl and O–H
bond lengths gradually increase, while the Hf–O and Cl–H
bond distances of Si(OH) 3–OH–HfCl4 complex slowly
shorten. Obviously, the Hf–Cl and Hf–O bond lengths
are changed slightly compared with the O–H and Cl–H
bond distances during the reaction process. As can be seen
inFig. 4 , after S = /C0 1.0 (amu)1/2 bohr, the O–H bond,
which up to this point is stretched little from the
Si(OH)3–OH–HfCl4 complex, begins to lengthen consider-
ably, while the Cl–H distance, shows an equally steep
decrease until the HCl molecule is fully formed. In addi-
tion, the similar selected bond lengths variations along
IRC of the decomposition of SiH3–OHfCl3–H2O complex
have also been achieved for the H 2O half-reaction. The plot
is qualitatively similar to that of the HfCl 4 half-reaction,
which indicates that both the HfCl 4 and the H 2O half-reac-
tions proceed through a similar four-center TS and an anal-
ogous reaction mechanism. It should be emphasized that
the oxygen and hydrogen atoms composed of the four cen-
ter TS come from the surface hydroxyl and H2O precursor
molecule for the HfCl 4 and H 2O half-reactions,
respectively.
3.5. Temperature eﬀects
The thermal energies ( DE) of the stationary points rela-
tive to the sum of the energies of the reactants for HfCl 4
and H 2O half-reaction on the Si 9O3H12–H–OH surface at
298, 400 and 600 K are given in Table 2 . As can be seen
in Table 2 , the thermal energies of the HfCl 4(a) and
H2O(a) chemisorbed complexes and the TS for dissociation
increase with temperature being raised, which results in the
instability of the HfCl4(a) and H 2O(a) intermediate com-
plexes. As a result, the residual reactants and by-products
HCl will possibly be removed at a higher temperature,
which has been conﬁrmed in the related experiments
[23–25]. For example, the experiment [25] has showed that
the content of residual hydrogen and chlorine monoto-
nously decreased with increasing growth temperature.
The chemisorption energies at these temperatures are
negative with respect to the initial reactants. The activation
barriers for the dissociation of chemisorbed HfCl4(a) are
always below the entrance channel from 298 to 600 K.
Hence, with raising the growth temperature it will be more
kinetically favorable for the HfCl4(a) adsorbed complexes
to dissociate rather than to desorb. On the contrary, the
activation barriers for the dissociation of chemisorbed
H2O(a) are always above the entrance channel from 298

Hf–O, O–H and Cl–H) along the calculated IRC for the elimination of

to 600 K. This indicates that the H 2O(a) chemisorbed com-
plexes tends to be desorb molecularly rather than to disso-
ciated to the corresponding products. However, lower
temperatures will lead to the process rates kinetically limit-
ed and is unfavorable for removal of by-product HCl.
Therefore, a suitable surface reaction temperature should
be found to drive the adsorbed complex towards dissocia-
tion and reach a maximum ﬁlm growth rate.
4. Conclusion
We have investigated theoretically the initial step of
ALD of HfO 2 on the hydroxylated SiO 2 surfaces by using
HfCl4 and H 2O as precursors. Both HfCl 4 and H 2O half-
reactions proceed through an analogous trapping-mediated
mechanism, where the precursors HfCl 4 and H 2O are
adsorbed directly on the SiO 2 surface sites to form a stable
chemisorbed complex. The IRC studies also show that
both HfCl4 and H 2O half-reactions follow a similar TS
and reaction pathway. By comparison of the reaction ener-
gies of precursors on diﬀerent size model surfaces, we ﬁnd
that the cluster size has a major eﬀect on the HfCl4 half-
reaction, especially on the formation of HfCl 4 complex as
compared to the H 2O half-reaction. In addition, we ﬁnd
that the adsorbed intermediate stability is lowered as the
surface temperature is raised, which in turn results in
increased desorption of adsorbed precursors.
