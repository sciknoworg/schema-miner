ABSTRACT: The reaction mechanism of area-selective atomic layer deposition
(AS-ALD) of Al2O3 thin ﬁlms using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) was
systematically investigated by theoretical and experimental studies. Trimethyla-
luminum (TMA) and H2O were used as the precursor and oxidant, respectively,
with octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) as an SAM to block Al 2O3 ﬁlm
formation. However, Al2O3 layers began to form on the ODPA SAMs after several
cycles, despite reports that CH3-terminated SAMs cannot react with TMA. We
showed that TMA does not react chemically with the SAM but is physically
adsorbed, acting as a nucleation site for Al2O3 ﬁlm growth. Moreover, the amount
of physisorbed TMA was aﬀected by the partial pressure. By controlling it, we
developed a new AS-ALD Al2O3 process with high selectivity, which produces
ﬁlms of ∼60 nm thickness over 370 cycles. The successful deposition of Al2O3
thin ﬁlm patterns using this process is a breakthrough technique in theﬁeld of
nanotechnology

■ INTRODUCTION
Three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures fabricated using 3D
patterning technology play a central role in many ﬁelds,
including fuel cells,1 data storage,2 sensors,3 photonics,4 and
microﬂuidics.5 Several 3D patterning methods have been used,
such as photolithography,6 nanoimprinting,7 near-ﬁeld scanning
optical microscopy (NSOM),8 and Dip-Pen.9 However, the
disadvantages of conventional methods include complicated
processes, short-range of materials suitable for patterning, and
expensive reagents.10 Area-selective atomic layer deposition
(AS-ALD) has been suggested as a simple one-step patterning
process with the various advantages of conventional ALD
processes, such as large area uniformity, excellent conformality,
and thickness control.11 As patterned ﬁlms can be obtained
directly during AS-ALD, without any subsequent processes,
complicated etching processes are reduced and the use of
expensive and poisonous reagents is minimized.5 Thus, AS-
ALD processes have been widely investigated in recent years12
and applied to various ﬁelds, such as microelectronics, 13
microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs), 14 biological and
chemical sensors,15 microﬂuidics,16 display units, and optoelec-
tronic devices.17
The AS-ALD technique is based on ALD,11 which is a thin-
ﬁlm growth technique that employs a sequence of self-limiting-
chemisorption reactions. Vapor-phase precursors and reactants
are chemically adsorbed onto surface functional groups in
alternating steps, separated by an inert gas purge to prevent gas-
phase reactions. During ALD, nucleation occurs favorably on
hydrophilic substrates that contain OH-terminated groups,
which promotes chemical reaction with the precursors.18 Thus,
the ALD reaction can be prevented by passivation of surface
OH-terminated groups and termination with unreactive groups,
such as CH3.

Widely used blocking resists to prevent ALD precursors from
nucleating include organic materials such as polymers19−21 and
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). 5,22 Polymers are easily
coated by spin coating and easily removed by lift-o ﬀ
processes.20 In addition, the absence of reactive sites on the
polymer should block chemical reactions with precursors. 23
However, previous studies have shown the growth of ALDﬁlms
on polymer substrates.24 As polymers are composed of many
repeating monomers, there can be a considerable amount of
free space among monomers near the surface.25 If the free
space is large enough, precursor molecules can be trapped on
exposure to the polymer surface. 25 Precursor molecules
retained inside the polymer could react on subsequent exposure
to reactants, resulting inﬁlm formation.25 Moreover, polymer
patterns require multistep patterning processes using photo-
lithography,21 making their application in mass production
diﬃcult. After formation of theﬁlm, a lift-oﬀ process for the
polymer masking layer is required.21 To remove the polymer
masking layer, the samples must be immersed in an organic
solvent such as acetone.20 However, the conformal dielectric
layer blocks the penetration of the solvent, so that manual
scratching is required to produce cracks on the dielectricﬁlm.20
Thus, AS-ALD using a polymer masking layer is not suitable for
nanoscale devices. In contrast, SAMs can be easily coated using
several methods, such as dipping,26−28 microcontact printing
(μCP), 5,28 and vaporization. 29 In addition, SAMs are
monomers that are attracted to each other by van der Waals
(VDW) attraction forces, resulting in dense packing on the
surface.5,27 Thus, unlike for polymers, there is ideally no free
space in the densely packed SAMs on the substrate. They are
thus able to block the di ﬀusion and penetration of the
precursor molecules, leading to the selective deposition of
ﬁlms.5 Furthermore, SAMs also have been used as ultrathin
resists for microcontact printing at the subnanometer scale.30,31
Thus, we used SAMs as an ALD masking layer in this study.
SAM monomers consist of three components: head, tail, and
chain groups. As SAM head groups chemically react with
surface reactive groups on the substrates, headgroup selection is
dependent on the kind of substrate. For example, alkylphos-
phonic acid [CH3(CH2)nPO3H2] SAMS are used for metal
surfaces, such as Ti, Ag, and Cu, and alkyltrichlorosilane
[CH3(CH2)nSiCl3] SAMs are used for SiO2,S i3N4, and other
oxide surfaces.32 The SAM tail groups eﬀectively changes the
termination of the substrate surface. For example, OH-, NH2-,
and COOH-terminated SAMs make surfaces reactive, 22,33
whereas CH 3-o rC F 3-terminated SAMs make surfaces
unreactive.5,22,34,35 To block the deposition of ALDﬁlms, tail
groups should not react with precursors and reactants; thus,
selection of the tail group depends on the kind of molecules to
which the surface will be exposed. Chain groups determine the
SAM packing density on a substrate. As the SAM chain length
increases, the interchain VDW attraction force becomes
stronger and SAM packing improves.27,36 In previous studies,
alkyl chains are widely used for AS-ALD, with a length of 12
carbon atoms (about 20 Å) found to be suﬃcient for blocking
ALD deposition.27
AS-ALD processes for various systems using SAMs with
CH3- and CF3-termination have been developed based on ALD
processes for metal oxides such as TiO2,35 HfO2, ZrO2,10 and
ZnO37 and metals such as Ru,38 Pt,39 Co,26 and Ni.34 However,
although the ALD of Al2O3 has been widely investigated owing
to its wide ALD window, high vapor pressure, inexpensive
precursor (trimethylaluminum (TMA)), and the wide applic-
ability of Al2O3, the selective deposition of Al2O3 thin ﬁlms
using SAMs has not been experimentally demonstrated using
an AS-ALD process with CH 3-terminated SAMs. However,
there are a few reports of the ALD of Al2O3 on CH3-terminated
SAMs.18,22,30,40 A previous density functional theory (DFT)
study showed that CH3-terminated SAMs have no thermody-
namic driving force for chemical reaction with TMA, so Al2O3
ﬁlms cannot be formed since nucleation is inhibited. 22 In
contrast, experimental studies on the ALD of Al2O3 on CH3-
terminated SAMs and OH-terminated surfaces showed similar
deposition of Al2O3 on both surfaces.18 Subsequent studies also
showed that ALD can deposit Al2O3 layers on CH3-terminated
SAMs.40 Similarly, SAMs could not block Al2O3 deposition
when Al2O3 was deposited at a thickness of greater than 6 nm
on a Si substrate.30 Thus, a fundamental study of the reaction
mechanism is necessary to understand the inconsistency
between theoretical calculations and experimental observations.

Furthermore, there has been no practical demonstration of
selectively deposited Al2O3 patterns using AS-ALD, despite its
technical importance.
In this work, we carried out a systematic investigation of the
reaction mechanism of AS-ALD of Al 2O3 on SAMs using
theoretical and experimental examinations of three SAMs with
diﬀerent head groups or chain lengths. Based on the reaction
mechanism, ALD Al2O3 process parameters were changed to
achieve high selectivity between SAMs and a Ti substrate.
Finally, we demonstrated selective deposition of Al2O3 thin
ﬁlms using newly developed AS-ALD processes for Al2O3.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Densely packed SAM layers are needed to investigate ALD on
SAM. We examined Ti substrates coated with three kinds of
commercial SAM materials: octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS),
octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA), and dodecylphosphonic
acid (DDPA).Figure 1 shows the surface morphologies of the
four di ﬀerent samples, as observed using ﬁeld emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM): bare Ti, ODTS-coated Ti, ODPA-coated
Ti, and DDPA-coated Ti. Parts a and e ofFigure 1 show the
surface morphologies of the bare Ti substrate, which has a
water contact angle (WCA) of 62°. Parts b and f ofFigure 1
show the surface morphologies of the ODTS-coated Ti
substrate, which has a rough surface because the headgroup is
incompatible with Ti substrates. The WCA of the ODTS-
coated Ti substrate is 104°. Parts c and g ofFigure 1 show
images of the ODPA-coated Ti substrate, which is much
smoother than the ODTS-coated Ti substrates because the
phosphonic acid headgroup is suitable for Ti substrates. The
WCA of the ODPA-coated Ti substrate is 110°, which indicates
that ODPA is highly packed on the Ti substrate. Parts d and h
ofFigure 1 show images of the DDPA-coated Ti substrate,
which also has a smooth surface. The WCA of the DDPA-
coated Ti substrate is 106°. This value is smaller than that of
the ODPA-coated Ti substrate owing to the shorter chain
length of DDPA. These results show that ODPA is the most
densely packed SAM on Ti substrates. Thus, we chose ODPA
for our study.
Figure 2a shows WCA values as a function of ALD Al2O3
cycles on ODPA on a Ti substrate using our general ALD
Al2O3 procedure. The conditions used were a TMA injection
pressure of 8.9 Torr, injection time of 100 ms, Ar purging
pressure of 1.3 Torr, and Ar purging time of 12 s. For
comparison, the WCA values before and after ALD on Ti-,
SiO2-, and HF-treated SiO2 were also measured. At 0 cycles, the
WCA values of the Ti-, SiO2-, and HF-treated Si substrates
were 61.7°, 70.0°, and 89.0°, respectively; after 20 cycles they
had decreased to 44.2°, 44.5°, and 44.4°, respectively. Similar
values were observed after 150 cycles, with the decreased WCA
caused by the formation of hydrophilic Al2O3 layers.41,42 In
addition, we performed XPS analysis to investigate Al 2O3
deposition on Ti. In Figure S3, the atomic concentration of
Al on the Ti substrate is about 33.2% after 370 ALD cycles.
This result means that the ALD Al2O3 ﬁlm was well deposited
on the Ti substrate. Compared to the change in the WCA
observed after 20 cycles of Al2O3 layer formation on Ti-, SiO2-,
and HF-treated Si substrates, the WCA values for ALD of
Al2O3 on ODPA on a Ti substrate decreased at a much slower
rate, as shown inFigure 2a. At 0 cycles, bare ODPA on the Ti
substrate was hydrophobic with a WCA of 110 °. After 20
cycles, the WCA value decreased to 109°, which is a smaller
change than those observed during the ALD of Al2O3 on Ti-,
SiO2-, and HF-treated Si substrates. Thisﬁnding indicates that
SAMs are more eﬀective than Ti-, SiO2-, and HF-treated Si
substrates at blocking the formation of Al2O3 layers. However,
the WCA value gradually decreases with repeated ALD cycles,
with the WCA value after 150 cycles being similar to those for
Ti-, SiO2-, and HF-treated substrates. The decrease of the WCA
might be due to defect formation in SAM layer. Previous
studies showed that SAM defects can be formed by external
energy, such as UV light irradiation,43 plasma treatment,43,44
and heat treatment (above 350 °C).43 Exposure to such
treatments caused the decomposition of the alkyl chains of
ODPA.43,44 In our study, among them, thermal energy from the
chamber could only generate the defect of SAM. We evaluated
the thermal stability of the ODPA SAM and measured the
WCA change of the ODPA-coated Ti sample in a vacuum
chamber at 150°C. Figure S4 shows the WCA change as a
function of exposure time. The WCA value remained
unchanged within the error throughout the heating time.
This indicates that the ODPA SAM was not degraded by
thermal energy during the ALD process. Thus, the decrease of
the WCA is mainly due to the formation of hydrophilic Al2O3.
Figure 2b shows XPS spectra of the Al 2p core level for ALD
Al2O3 on ODPA/Ti substrates. Deconvolution of the Al 2p
peaks showed one subpeak at 75.0 eV, which was assigned to
the bonding of Al2O3.45 As the number of ALD cycles increases,
the intensity of this peak gradually increased, indicating
increasing amounts of Al2O3 bonding. Based on the WCA
change and XPS results, we concluded that ODPA surfaces did

not block Al2O3 deposition, similar to the results of previous
experimental studies.18,37−39
To investigate the reaction mechanism of ALD of Al2O3 on
ODPA, the adsorption energy of a TMA molecule with an
ODPA molecule was explored using DFT calculations, as
shown inFigure 3. Parts a and b ofFigure 3 show the initial
states of the TMA and CH3-terminated SAM cluster models
used in the calculations, respectively; the models used in this
work were similar to those in a previous study.22 Parts c, d, and
eo f Figure 3 show the molecular con ﬁgurations for a
physisorbed state, transition state, and chemisorbed state,
respectively. The energy levels of each reaction pathway are
plotted inFigure 3. The physisorption energy of a TMA
molecule on an SAM cluster is−15.2 kcal/mol. However, the
chemisorption process, involving generation of CH 4,i s
thermodynamically unfavorable with a high energy barrier of
59.3 kcal/mol. These results are consistent with previous
calculations,22 where the reaction energy barrier was also high.
In addition, the enthalpy of the chemical reaction was 2.5 kcal/
mol more endothermic than that of the reactants, which
suggests that the reaction of TMA with the CH3-terminated
SAM is energetically unfavorable. In contrast to previous
calculations,22 we observed another possible adsorption
mechanism, involving a physical interaction between TMA
and CH3-terminated SAM molecules. Prior to chemical
reaction, TMA and SAM molecules are physisorbed with
each other in the transition state, which has an energy level of
−15.2 kcal/mol. As the reaction energy during ALD is solely
derived from thermal energy (150 °C, 0.8 kcal/mol), the
energy barrier of 59.2 kcal/mol for the chemical reaction is too
high. Thus, rather than the chemical reaction, an exothermic
physical reaction is possible, which is energetically favorable
with an enthalpy of−15.2 kcal/mol. Similar to chemisorbed
molecules, physisorbed molecules could act as nucleation sites.
Previous studies on ALD of metal oxides such as HfO2 and
Al2O3 on graphene, which is chemically inert like CH 3-
terminated SAMs, showed that metal oxide ﬁlms grow on
graphene.46 Precursor molecules, such as HfCl4
46 and TMA,47
physisorb on graphene and act as nucleation sites for ALD,
leading to the formation of metal oxideﬁlms, similar to the
growth of ALD Al2O3 ﬁlms on SAMs in this work. Thus, we
conclude that TMA molecules physisorb onto ODPA and the
ALD reaction occurs through physisorbed TMA molecules as
nucleation sites, leading toﬁlm growth and decreased WCA
values (Figure 2a).
Surface reactions between gas molecules and substrates are
aﬀected by the total number of molecules exposed to the
surface,48 The total amount can be calculated using the product
of pressure and time as the exposure value in langmuir units.49
To decrease the amount of physisorbed molecules on the
surface for high selectivity, we controlled pressure and exposure
time. To investigate the eﬀect of TMA exposure value, we
conducted single TMA dose t ests on ODPA-coated Ti
substrates. Table 1shows WCA changes with controlled partial
pressure and exposure time for TMA. The WCA of the ODPA-
coated Ti substrate was 110° (sample A). After exposure to
TMA molecules at a high pressure for a long time (exposure
value of 534 Torr·s (8.9 Torr×60 s)), the WCA decreased by
16° (sample B). The decrease in WCA is thought to be due to
the formation of AlOx on the surface of ODPA, similar to that
shown in Figure 2a. As there are many oxidants in air, such as
H2O and O2, hypergolic ignition of TMA can occur on the
surface under ambient air.50 Then, physisorbed TMA on the
ODPA surfaces can react with oxidants, resulting in the
formation of AlOx, which results in the reduction of the WCA.
Similarly, decreasing the exposure time (from 60 to 10 s) with
the same high pressure (8.9 Torr) caused a similar decrease in
the WCA (sample C) compared with bare ODPA, indicating
that exposure time does not signiﬁcantly a ﬀect TMA
physisorption. For the two time-control cases, although the
exposure value for the short time case was six times smaller
than that for long time case, signiﬁcant blocking of the
formation of AlOx was not observed. In contrast, pressure
control aﬀected the formation of AlO x on the ODPA/Ti
substrate. When we decreased the partial pressure of TMA
molecules almost six times (from 8.9 to 1.3 Torr) with the
same exposure time, the WCA value did not decrease (sample
D) compared with bare ODPA. Although the exposure value
for the low-pressure case is almost the same as that of the short
time case, the WCA shows completely diﬀerent behavior. Thus,
the amount of adsorbed TMA molecules is not governed by the
exposure value, but is aﬀected dominantly by pressure rather
than by time. The observation of this control mechanism is very
interesting, as time control is known as a common method for
removing physisorbed molecules on the surface in ALDﬁelds.51
To investigate the dependence of the adsorption behavior of
TMA molecules on time and pressure, we performed molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations.Figure 4a shows a simulated cell
with dimensions of 45.52 × 45.52 × 60.00 Å, as the ODPA
SAM chain is located on the Ti (100) surface with 2 × 2
coverage. Parts b and c ofFigure 4 are snapshots (captured

from supporting movies 1 and 2, respectively) obtained after
MD simulations of 10 ns for 1.3 Torr (low pressure) and 8.9
Torr (high pressure), respectively, which are the same pressures
as used for the experiments shown inTable 1.I nFigure 4b,c, a
small fraction of the TMA molecules diﬀused into the ODPA
ﬁlm. The formation of Al2O3 may be due to reaction between
the remaining TMA molecules on the surface of the SAM or
those diﬀused into the SAMs and H2O. The concentration of
molecules physisorbed on the surface of the ODPA SAMs and
molecules diﬀused into the ODPA SAMs is plotted inFigure 4d
as a function of injection time up to 10 ns. It is clearly shown
that the amount of physisorbed TMA molecules is much larger
under the high-pressure conditions than under the low-pressure
conditions, which is consistent with the experimental
observations in Table 1. In addition, in both cases, the TMA
concentration does not change with time after saturation. In
other words, the chemical equilibrium of the reaction between
TMA molecule and SAMs is relatively independent of time
after saturation. Instead, the saturation values depend on the
partial pressure, with the TMA concentration under the high-
pressure conditions about 6−7 times higher than that under the
low-pressure conditions (11.30× 10−3 mol/m2 and 1.76× 10−3
mol/m2, respectively, at 8 ns).
Based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, the partial
pressure of the reactant is a central parameter describing the
adsorption process. The maximum amount of adsorbed
molecules, the so-called monolayer capacity is determined by
the thermodynamic conditions and the structure of the
molecules and substrates.52 The fraction of surface coverage
(Q)i sd eﬁned as the ratio of the amount of adsorbed substance
to the monolayer capacity at speciﬁc moment.52 The change of
the surface coverage describes the change of the amount of
adsorbed molecules on substrates, which is the diﬀerence
between the adsorption rate and desorption rate. The
adsorption rate (ra) and desorption rate (rd) are given by the
following equations53,54

where ka and kd are the adsorption and desorption rate
constants, respectively, which are functions of temperature, and
pA is the partial pressure ofA over the surface. Usingeqs 1and

the following equation:

Based oneqs 1and 4, as the partial pressure decreases, both
the adsorption rate and equilibrium coverage decrease. Thus,
the amount of physisorbed molecules decreased with
decreasing TMA pressure, so that AlOx formation was blocked
more at low TMA pressures compared to high pressure, as
shown inTable 1. In addition, based oneq 1, increasing the
process temperature should decrease the adsorption rate, as the
amount of physisorbed molecules on the surface would be
desorbed by the increased thermal energy of the substrate.47 To
investigate the eﬀect of process temperature, we used 150 ALD
cycles to deposit Al2O3 on ODPA using the general recipe at
various temperatures, 50, 100, 150, and 200°C (see Figure S1
in the Supporting Information). The WCA of all samples
decreased to about 44° after the deposition. This result is
attributed to the low thermal energy at 50−200 °C (0.23−0.94
kcal/mol), which is much smaller than the physisorption energy
(15.2 kcal/mol). Therefore, desorption of physisorbed
molecules from the surface is diﬃcult in the thermal energy
range used in this work. Thus, in this work, we believe that the
amount of physisorbed TMA molecules is predominately
aﬀected by the partial pressure of TMA molecules.
In addition to TMA adsorption, the desorption process was
investigated using controlled Ar purging. In contrast to strong
chemical bonding, physical interactions are weak and can be
aﬀected by a purging gas. Without Ar purging, a single dose of
TMA molecules under high-pressure and long-time conditions
resulted in a WCA of 94° (sample A), as physisorbed TMA on
the surface was oxidized after exposure in air, as shown inTable
2. After Ar purging under high-pressure and long-time
conditions, the WCA increased (from 94° to 110°; sample
B), which is same as that of bare ODPA-coated Ti. This result
indicates that physisorbed TMA molecules were removed by
the Ar-purging process under these conditions. Decreasing the
Ar purging time (from 60 to 10 s) with the same high pressure
(8.9 Torr) also resulted in a WCA value of 110° (sample C). In
contrast, when the pressure was decreased (from 8.9 to 1.3

Torr) with long exposure time (60 s), the WCA after Ar
purging remained the same at 94° (sample D), indicating that
low-pressure Ar did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the desorption of
physisorbed molecules. In addition, in terms of throughput in
the ALD process, it is advantageous that increased pressure
rather than increased time is beneﬁcial. These results are in
good correspondence with the TMA physisorption case shown
inTable 1 and Figure 4 . Additionally, we observed that
exposure time and pressure of H2O molecules had no eﬀect on
Al2O3 formation (see Table S1 in theSupporting Information).
On the basis of the experimental and simulation results, ALD
processes with varying pressures of TMA and Ar were
investigated by examining the WCA change to optimize ALD
processes for blocking deposition of Al2O3 on ODPA (Figure
5). Based on our general ALD Al2O3 process shown inFigure
2a, we decreased the TMA pressure (from 7.8 to 1.3 Torr) to
reduce the amount of physisorbed TMA molecules on ODPA,
as shown inFigure 5a. In contrast to the SiO2- and HF-treated
Si substrates, the WCA value using the decreasing TMA
pressure process was 96° after 150 ALD cycles. In addition, the
WCA change for the low TMA pressure case (from 110° to 96°
after 150 cycles) is much smaller than that for the high TMA
pressure case (from 110° to 45° after 150 cycles), as shown in
Figure 2a. This result indicates that decreasing the TMA
pressure blocks physisorption between TMA and ODPA
molecules, resulting in the formation of less Al2O3. In addition,
we increased the Ar purging pressure to remove residual
physisorbed TMA molecules from the surface, as shown in
Figure 5b. After 150 cycles, the WCA value was 109°, which is
almost same as that of bare ODPA-coated Ti. Further
increasing the number of ALD cycles to 370, changed the
WCA slightly from 110° to 105°. In addition, we performed
XPS analysis of the Al 2p spectra to investigate the amount of
Al after 370 ALD cycles on both ODPA and Ti substrates as
shown inFigure S3. The atomic concentration of Al is about
3.6% for the ODPA substrate after 370 ALD cycles, while it is
about 33.2% for the Ti substrate. A previous study showed that
3 nm thick Al2O3 ﬁlm has a low atomic concentration of Al of
about 5%. Thus, after 370 cycles, the thickness of the Al2O3 ﬁlm
on ODPA was probably less than 3 nm.55 Compared to the
approximately 60 nm thickness of Al2O3 on Ti substrate, the
newly developed AS-ALD process e ﬀectively blocked the
deposition of the ALD Al2O3 ﬁlm on the ODPA surface over
370 cycles of ALD. The reason for the slight decrease of the
WCA from 110° to 105° might be the existence of a small
amount of AlOx on the ODPA substrate, corresponding to a
3.6% atomic concentration of Al, on ODPA, as shown inFigure
S3. In addition, the error range of the WCA value is about 3.2°,
and thus, the measurement error might be included. The
thickness of the Al2O3 layer on the Si substrate after 370 cycles
is about 60 nm. The growth per cycle (GPC) in the ALD Al2O3
process is about 1.6 Å/cycle. The generally reported growth per
cycle values for ALD Al2O3 using TMA and H2O are about
0.9−1.7 Å/cycle.53,56 The GPC for ALD is aﬀected by various
process parameters, such as the growth temperature,53 pressure
of reactants,53,57 exposure time of precursors and reactants,53
and reactor design.58 For example, varying the working pressure
changed the gas ﬂow rate near the surface, which in turn
changed the sticking probability on the surface, leading to a
change in the GPC.56 A previous study reporting the ALD
Al2O3 process for working pressures of 2 and 760 Torr, found a
wide range in the growth per cycle (0.9−1.7 Å/cycle).56 In
addition, a previous study from our laboratory showed the ALD
Al2O3 process with a GPC of 1.5 Å/cycle.59 In our process, the
working pressure was about 9 Torr due to an increase in Ar
purging pressure; therefore, the rate of 1.6 Å/cycle reported
here is comparable with the previous work. Furthermore, there
is a possibility that the purge process in our developed process
might be very slow and nonsaturating due to porosity or
sponginess of the SAMs. The SAMs could contain TMA
molecules and might release some TMA molecules during the
H2O pulse leading to an increase in the growth per cycle, just
above the typically reported growth per cycle. To investigate
the SAM eﬀect on the parasitic addition of growth per cycle, we
have performed ALD Al2O3 on a Ti substrate with and without
ODPA in the ALD reactor.Figure S8 shows that the growth
per cycle for both conditions was identical, 1.6 Å/cycle. Based

on the results, we hypothesize that the TMA molecules in the
SAMs did not signi ﬁcantly release during the H 2O pulse.
Therefore, by using the optimized ALD Al 2O3 process
developed in this study, selectivity can be achieved between
ODPA and Si with Al2O3 thicknesses of up to 60 nm. Further
decrease in the TMA pressure and increase in the purging time
compared to those of the optimized conditions could lead to
reduced ALD GPC. In the case of TMA pressure, 1.3 Torr of
TMA injection pressure was the minimum required for the
ALD reaction, since Al2O3 was not deposited at TMA injection
pressures lower than 1.3 Torr. In the case of purging time,
Figure S6shows the WCA values as a function of the number
of ALD Al2O3 cycles on the ODPA on Ti substrate using
diﬀerent ALD recipes, with two Ar purging times of 12 and 60
s. Similar values of WCA were observed after the deposition,
indicating that 12 s is suﬃcient to purge excess gas molecules
on the surface. In spite of the optimized ALD process
conditions, we observed that the WCA decreased slightly, by
about 5°, after 370 cycles. The reason for the slight decrease in
the WCA from 110° to 105° might be the existence of a small
amount of AlOx on the ODPA substrate, corresponding to a
3.6% atomic concentration of Al, on ODPA as shown inFigure
S3. In addition, the error range of the WCA value is about 3.2°,
and thus the measurement error might be included.
On the basis of developed ALD process shown inFigure 5b,
Al2O3 nanopatterns were demonstrated by using AS-ALD on
ODPA-patterned Ti substrates, where the widths of the ODPA
line pattern were 1μm with 4 μm spaces between the lines.
Al2O3 ﬁlms were deposited for 370 cycles, and after deposition,
the ODPA SAMs were etched using O2 plasma for 60 s.Figure
6a shows an SEM image of an Al2O3 nanopattern, and Figure
6b shows EDS elemental line scans for Al, and O. The EDS
analysis revealed that the dark regions inFigure 6a are Al2O3-
deposited areas. The surface morphology was analyzed using
AFM (Figure 6c), and the pattern height is shown inFigure 6d.
A height of about 62.5 nm was observed for Al2O3 on the
patterned substrate after 370 AS-ALD cycles, which is similar to
that on Si substrates that were placed in the same chamber for
the same time. Thus, we think that the suggested reaction
mechanism and developed process has the potential to be
applied to a variety of systems with 3D nanostructures and
could be extended to various surface scienceﬁelds where
control of the molecule adsorption rate is required.
■ CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we systemically investigated AS-ALD of Al2O3 on
SAMs by varying SAM species, process temperature, exposure
time, and pressure of precursor molecules. We observed that
ODPA showed the highest packing density among other SAMs
owing to the ability of its headgroup to interact with Ti
substrates its long chain length. Theoretical and experimental
investigations of the reaction mechanism for ALD of Al2O3 on
SAMs showed that ALD Al2O3 ﬁlms could be deposited owing
to physisorbed TMA molecules acting as nucleation sites, with
the pressure of TMA being the key factor in determining the
amount of physisorbed molecules on the surface. In addition,
we developed an ALD process by changing the TMA injection
pressure and Ar purging pressure conditions, which results in
blocking ALD of Al2O3 on ODPA. Finally, we demonstrated
the production of 60 nm thick patterned Al2O3 ﬁlms using the
newly developed AS-ALD process. We believe that the
determination of the reaction mechanism and the demon-
stration of nanopatterns in this work are unprecedented, and
these novel results in nanotechnology will have a signiﬁcant
impact on various applications requiring nanopatterned ALD
ﬁlms. For example, ALD Al2O3 ﬁlms have been highlighted in
the organic light emitting diode (OLED) encapsulation area
because 50 nm thick Al2O3 ﬁlms showed excellent water vapor
transmission rates.60 However, to use the ALD Al2O3 ﬁlm in
mass production, Al2O3 ﬁlm should not exist on the electrode
area of Ti for metal interconnection. Thus, the use of a
patterning process after ALD is required, but many patterning
processes are diﬃcult to use in mass production due to the lack
of etchants for Al2O3 ﬁlms. In addition, since polymer blocking
materials cannot be used in OLED mass production due to the
complicated patterning process, development of an AS-ALD
process of Al2O3 using alternative blocking materials such as
SAMs is very important. However, previous reports have shown
that the thickness of the AS-ALD Al2O3 pattern is limited to∼6
nm or less.30 This was the motivation for our study, and we
achieved a thickness of up to ∼60 nm based on the newly
investigated reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the novel AS-
ALD Al2O3 process, which was developed by investigating the
eﬀect of various process parameters on physisorption,
represents a starting point for research into AS-ALD based
on physisorption mechanisms.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Substrate and SAM Solution Preparation.In this study, 120
nm thick Tiﬁlms deposited on Si substrates were used as the substrate.
The Ti ﬁlms were deposited using DC magnetron sputtering with a
plasma power of 120 W. After sputtering, the Ti substrates were
cleaned by sonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), followed
by rinsing with deionized (DI) water, andﬁnally dried under a N2 ﬂow
to remove organic materials. We used three commercial SAMs:
octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS; 97%, Aldrich Co.), octadecylphos-
phonic acid (ODPA; 97%, Strem Co.), and dodecylphosphonic acid
(DDPA; 95%, Alfa Co.). ODTS and ODPA have the same carbon
chain length (n = 18) but diﬀerent head groups (silane for ODTS and
phosphonic acid for ODPA). ODPA and DDPA have the same

headgroup (phosphonic acid) but diﬀerent chain lengths (n = 18 for
ODPA and n = 12 for DDPA). Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as
the solvent for ODPA and DDPA, and toluene was used for ODTS.
The concentrations of the ODPA and DDPA solutions were 2.461 and
1 mM in THF, respectively,62 whereas the concentration of the ODTS
solution was 10 mM in toluene.28 The WCA of the bare Ti substrate
was 60°, which was changed to about 104°, 110°, and 106° after
stamping with ODTS, ODPA, and DDPA SAMs, respectively (see
Figure 1), indicating that the surface termination was changed from
reactive groups to unreactive CH3 termination. More densely packed
CH3-terminated SAMs show more hydrophobic surface characteristics
as the ODPA SAM had the most hydrophobic properties among the
examined SAMs. InFigure S2, we also investigated the blocking
properties of the SAMs. From the results, we chose the ODPA SAM as
a blocking material for AS-ALD of Al2O3 on Ti substrates.
SAM Coating and Etching Methods.We coated ODPA on a Ti
substrates by the dipping and stamping methods, as shown inFigure
S7. The WCA values of the dipped and stamped substrates were
similar, indicating that the quality of the microcontact printed SAM is
comparable to that of the SAM coated by the dipping method, in
accordance with previous reports. 5,28,35 SAMs were coated on Ti
substrates using a μCP printing method. As a stamp, poly-
(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (Sylgard 184) was prepared from a
10:1 (weight ratio) mixture of Sylgard silicone elastomer 184 and
Sylgard silicone elastomer 184 curing agent. The components were
mixed and allowed to sit for 5 min. Then liquid PDMS was poured
into a polystyrene (PS) Petri dish and heated in an 80°C oven for 2 h.
Subsequently, the PDMS stamp was allowed to cool to room
temperature, peeled oﬀ the Petri dish, and cut to the size of 4 cm2.T o
study the ALD of Al2O3 on SAM, the PDMS stamp was dipped into
the SAM solution for 5 min and then gently placed onto the Ti
substrates heated on a hot plate at 80°C. After stamping, the stamp
was lifted smoothly from the edge of the stamp. For the AS-ALD
Al2O3 study, we made a Si mold with a pattern and poured the PDMS
solution into a PS Petri dish containing the patterned Si mold. All
other stamping processes were the same as those used for ALD of
Al2O3 on SAM. After deposition of the ALD Al2O3 ﬁlm, the SAMs
were etched by O2 plasma treatment63 using a O2 gas ﬂow rate of 200
sccm and plasma power of 300 W.
TMA Single Dose Test, Ar-Purging Test, and Actual ALD
Process. In this study, we performed three types of tests: TMA single
dose, Ar purging, and ordinary ALD Al2O3 process. The TMA single
dose and Ar purging tests were performed to study the reaction
between TMA molecules and SAM. Adsorption in the TMA single
dose test and desorption in the Ar purging test were investigated
depending on the exposure value, which was the product of pressure
and time, deﬁned as the Langmuir exposure. Subsequently, the actual
ALD process was studied. A homemade ALD system was used with
laminar gasﬂow. Here, TMA was employed as a precursor for ALD of
Al2O3, and H2O was used as a reactant. TMA and H2O in the bubbler
and water container, respectively, were maintained at room temper-
ature. TMA and H2O were directly evaporated, and the vapor was
delivered to the main chamber without a carrier gas. The actual ALD
Al2O3 process on the SAM was performed using the general recipe
from our laboratory. We performed 150 ALD cycles on ODPA at 50,
100, 150, and 200°C, and the results showed similar tendencies (see
Figure S1 in theSupporting Information). Therefore, we chose 150°C
as the growth temperature for AS-ALD of Al2O3 on ODPA. We varied
this general recipe to develop the AS-ALD process. The TMA
exposure conditions were changed from 8.9 to 1.3 Torr TMA injection
pressure and from 60 to 10 s TMA injection time. We also changed
the Ar exposure conditions from 1.3 to 8.9 Torr Ar injection pressure
and from 60 to 10 s Ar injection time. Three kinds of substrates were
used: 300 nm thick SiO2 on Si, hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF)-treated
Si(100), and SAM-coated Ti. The SiO2 substrates were cleaned by
sonication in acetone and IPA, followed by rinsing with DI water, and
drying under a N2 ﬂow to remove organic materials. The Si substrates
were cleaned in HF solution (1:10 HF/DI water, weight ratio) at 25
°C for 10 s to remove native oxides.
Analysis of Film Properties.The wetting properties of the SAM-
coated surfaces were evaluated by the sessile drop technique using a
contact angle (CA) analyzer (Phoenix-300, Plus, SEO) with deionized
water. Water CA (WCA) images were acquired using a charge-coupled
device video camera and an image analysis system (Image XP ver. 5.9,
SEO). The volume of each water droplet was 6μL. The WCA value of
the droplet was obtained using the ImageJ 1.50i program (Wayne
Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The deposition of Al2O3 on
SAMs was observed by WCA changes and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS; K-alpha, Thermo UK). For XPS, we used a
monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV beam energy and 400μm2
analysis area). Surface cleaning prior to XPS analysis was performed
using Ar sputtering for 20 s to remove surface contaminants. The
surface C 1 s peak at 284.5 eV was used as a reference to calibrate the
spectrum energy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM; Park System, XE-
BiO) was performed in noncontact mode to evaluate the surface
morphology. The α-step surface proﬁler (DektakXT Stylus Proﬁler)
was used to evaluate the step height in patterned samples. The
morphologies of the patterned Al2O3 ﬁlms were characterized using
ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-
4800) and chemical analyses were conducted on the samples using an
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDS; Bruker QUAN-
TAX 200) attached to the microscope. For EDS analysis, a 20 keV
acceleration voltage was used.
Theoretical Calculations. We used DFT calculations to
investigate the physisorption and chemisorption behavior of TMA
with the SAM, using the potential energy surface of a TMA molecule
on the CH3-terminated SAM. The DFT calculations were performed
with the Q-Chem software64 at the calculation level of the hybrid
B3LYP functional with the 6-311G** basis set. We considered cluster
models similar to those used in a previous calculation study.22 In
addition, all of the calculations included a correction for VDW
interactions using Grimme’s empirical dispersion (DFR-D2).65 We
also performed MD simulations with Universal Force Field 66 to
observe the dynamic properties of TMA molecules on the SAM. For
the MD simulation, we used the LAMMPS67 software with a Verlet68
integration time step of 1 fs. All MD simulations were performed in a
canonical NVT ensemble, in which the temperature was maintained at
423 K using a Nosé −Hoover thermostat69 with a damping parameter
of 0.01 fs−1. We set the simulation cell to have dimensions of 45.52×
45.52 × 60.00 Å, where the vacuum height was assumed to be 30 Å.
Figure S5a,b shows the simulation results for the placement of the
ODPA SAM on the Ti (100) surface with 1× 1 and 2× 2 coverage,
respectively. A previous study showed that the SAM molecules adopt
conformations that minimize the free energy70 and that in order to
minimize the free energy, SAM molecules are adsorbed on surface with
tilted and twisted structures.70 In Figure S5a, we observed that with 1
× 1 coverage the ODPA SAM adsorbed on the Ti substrate oriented in
the normal direction of the surface. There was no penetration of the
TMA molecules into the ODPA ﬁlm. However, this structure is
energetically unstable. Thus, we chose the 2× 2 coverage to represent
a structure comparable to the real SAM.
