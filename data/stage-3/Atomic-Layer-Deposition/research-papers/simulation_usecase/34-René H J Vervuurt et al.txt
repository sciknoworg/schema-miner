ABSTRACT: A novel method to form ultrathin, uniform Al2O3
layers on graphene using reversible hydrogen plasma function-
alization followed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is
presented. ALD on pristine graphene is known to be a challenge
due to the absence of dangling bonds, leading to nonuniform
ﬁlm coverage. We show that hydrogen plasma functionalization
of graphene leads to uniform ALD of closed Al2O3 ﬁlms down
to 8 nm in thickness. Hall measurements and Raman
spectroscopy reveal that the hydrogen plasma functionalization
is reversible upon Al2O3 ALD and subsequent annealing at 400
°C and in this way does not deteriorate the graphene’s charge
carrier mobility. This is in contrast with oxygen plasma
functionalization, which can lead to a uniform 5 nm thick
closedﬁlm, but which is not reversible and leads to a reduction
of the charge carrier mobility. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the uniform growth on both H2 and O2
plasma functionalized graphene to the enhanced adsorption of trimethylaluminum (TMA) on these surfaces. A DFT analysis of
the possible reaction pathways for TMA precursor adsorption on hydrogenated graphene predicts a binding mechanism that
cleans oﬀ the hydrogen functionalities from the surface, which explains the observed reversibility of the hydrogen plasma
functionalization upon Al2O3 ALD.
1. INTRODUCTION
Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) material that has attracted
signiﬁcant interest in the scienti ﬁc community due to its
interesting electronic, optical, and thermal properties. The high
carrier mobility of graphene and large maximum current density
make it a promising candidate for postsilicon electronics.1 The
deposition of thin high-k dielectric ﬁlms on graphene is
required for many of these electronic applications. For example,
radio frequency transistors require the deposition of dielectric
layers on top of the graphene for good electrostatic control of
the channel and better device reliability,2,3 while lateral spin
valves require ultrathin dielectrics on the graphene as a tunnel
barrier.4
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the preferred method to
deposit dielectric layers on graphene, due to its ability to
deposit high quality and uniform materials with precise control
of the layer thickness. However, the initiation of ALD growth
on graphene is known to be a challenge due to the lack of out-
of-plane bonds and surface hydrophobicity. ALD growth of
dielectrics on pristine graphene therefore only occurs on defect
sites or grain boundaries where dangling bonds or functional
groups are present.5,6 To overcome this issue diﬀerent surface
preparation techniques to initialize ALD growth on graphene
have been investigated in the literature.5−22 In general these
techniques can be divided into three categories: 1) the use of
seed-layers, such as self-assembled monolayers, polymers,
evaporated metals (which are oxidized in air before ALD),
and layers deposited by chemical vapor deposition
(CVD),5,10,22 2) the creation of functional groups on the
graphene surface by for example ozone 11 and plasma 12
treatments, and 3) tuning the underlying substrate to enhance
the nucleation.13
The use of polymer seed-layers results in the conformal
coverage of ALD oxide without damaging the graphene.5,14,15
However, the polymer interlayer that is used has a low-k value,
leading to a higher equivalent oxide thickness for the deposited
polymer/oxide stack. Furthermore, the used polymers can dope
the graphene, which results in a large Dirac-point shift of the
created devices.14 Oxidized metal seed-layers avoid these issues
but trap charges at the graphene-dielectric interface. This
deteriorates the mobility of graphene layers and reduces device
performance.10 The use of CVD layers to initialize growth does
not aﬀect the graphene properties but no longer oﬀers the

advantages of ALD in terms of thickness control, resulting in
the deposition of thick layers (>10 nm).22
Degradation of the electrical properties of graphene is also
observed for most covalent functionalization methods. This is
because these methods rely on the conversion ofsp2-C bonds
to sp3 bonds, disrupting the 2D nature of graphene.11,12,16,17
For example, ozone functionalization at 200°C creates epoxy
surface groups that enhance the nucleation of Al 2O3 on
graphene, yielding uniform Al2O3 growth on the graphene.11 At
the same time, however, these groups enhance the scattering of
charge carriers in graphene, resulting in decreased carrier
mobilities. To avoid this problem the ozone functionalization
can be performed at lower temperatures. At temperatures
below 50°C, ozone is physisorbed on graphene leaving thesp2
bonding intact. This prevents damaging the graphene and can
even provide an improvement in the electrical properties of
graphene following Al2O3 ALD.18,19 The limited stability of
physisorbed ozone on the graphene surface, however, also
requires Al2O3 deposition at these low temperatures, decreasing
the quality of the depositedﬁlms.23
The use of O2 and N2 plasmas to functionalize the graphene
causes severe damage to the graphene, degrading its electrical
properties.12,16 To avoid this Shin et al. and Nourbakhsh et al.
performed an O2 plasma treatment on a sacriﬁcial graphene
layer.20,21 This layer served as a nucleation layer for Al2O3 ALD
that was either transferred onto a pristine graphene layer after
the plasma exposure20 or protected the underlying graphene
during the plasma exposure.21 With this method uniform Al2O3
layers down to 4 nm in thickness could be deposited without
damaging the graphene. The requirement of an additional
graphene transfer step, however, makes the process time-
consuming and could trap polymer residues left over from the
transfer procedure in between the layers.
To date H2 plasmas have not been studied for the uniform
growth of dielectric layers by ALD on graphene. The use of H2
plasmas to initialize growth on graphene might be of interest
because the H2 plasma treatment (hydrogenation) has shown
to be reversible.24,25 The pristine graphene properties can be
recovered after annealing the hydrogenated graphene in an Ar
atmosphere at 400°C. This might make it possible to directly
grow ALD layers on hydrogen functionalized graphene, without
the need for sacriﬁcial layers or damaging the graphene, since
the pristine graphene properties might be recovered after
processing by an annealing step.
To this extent H2 plasma pretreatments are investigated in
this work to initialize Al2O3 ALD growth directly on graphene,
without the use of a sacriﬁcial layer. The ability of the H2
plasma pretreatment to obtain uniform ALD growth on
graphene is compared to O2 plasma pretreatments and pristine
graphene. The type of functional group created by the H2 and
O2 plasma treatments is studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The eﬀects of the plasma treatments on
the structural and electrical properties of the functionalized
graphene is investigated by Raman and Hall measurements,
before and after plasma treatment, after Al2O3 ALD, and after
an anneal at 400 °C. Furthermore, the underlying reaction
mechanism of the Al 2O3 precursor adsorption on the
functionalized graphene is investigated using ab inito
calculations.
2. METHODOLOGY
2.1. Experimental Methods.Graphene samples (1× 1 cm) were
synthesized by CVD on Cu foil (Alfa Aesar 99.8%, No. 13382) of 25
μm. Before growth the Cu foil was cleaned using acetone, methanol,
and a 30 s 1.0 M nitric acid (HNO3) etch to remove the surface oxide.
After rinsing in deionized water the Cu foil was dried and loaded into a
tube furnace. The Cu foil was heated to 1050°C under an Ar/H2
(500/10 sccm) ﬂow at a pressure of 0.4 Torr. After annealing the
sample for 30 min, the H2 ﬂow was reduced to 6, and 100 sccm CH4
was added to the gas ﬂow for 20 min, resulting in a monolayer
coverage of graphene on the Cu foil. The sample was cooled down to
room temperature in 15 min while leaving the gasﬂows on.
The graphene on Cu was transferred to 90 nm SiO2/Si (100) wafers
by wet chemistry using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) A4 950k
(Micro Chem.) as a support layer. Ferric chloride (FeCl3 0.1 M) was
used to etch the Cu. After transfer the PMMA was removed using
acetone with aﬁnal rinse in methanol. The samples were subsequently
annealed at 400°C in an Ar/H2 atmosphere for 2 h, to minimize any
PMMA residue remaining after PMMA lift-oﬀ.
The O2 and H2 plasma functionalization of the graphene was
performed in an Oxford Instruments FlexAl reactor using a 100 W 50
mTorr plasma at 50°C and a gas ﬂow of 50 sccm O 2 or H2,
respectively. ALD was performed in the same reactor at 100°C using
trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O. The timing sequence was as
follows: (0.03 s, 4 s, 0,2 s, 10 s), (TMA, purge, H2O, purge). After
ALD one set of samples was annealed at 400 °C in an Ar/H 2
atmosphere for 2 h in a tube furnace.
The quality and electrical properties of the graphene samples were
characterized before and after plasma treatment following ALD and
after annealing with a Renishaw Invia Raman microscope (514.5 nm)
and an Ecopia HMS-5300 Hall E ﬀect Measurement System. The
graphene samples used for the Hall measurements were approximately
1× 1c m2 in size. Ohmic contact to the graphene was obtained by
applying conductive silver paste at the corners of the graphene
samples. The silver paint was applied before annealing the pristine
graphene samples at 400°C to exclude the inﬂuence of the annealing
process on the contact formation. The formation of an Ohmic contact
was conﬁrmed by I−V measurements, which showed Ohmic behavior
over the full measured range (−100−100 μA). The Hall measure-
ments were performed at 25 °C under N2 ambient. Prior to the
measurements the samples were annealed at 150°C for 10 min to
remove any adsorbed H2O from the graphene. Information on the
surface groups created after plasma treatment was determined by a
Thermo Scienti ﬁc K-Alpha KA 1066 X-ray photon spectroscope
(XPS). The uniformity of the deposited Al2O3 ﬁlms was determined
with a JEOL 7500 FA scanning electron microscope (SEM), a NT-
MDT Solver P47 atomic force microscope (AFM), and a JEOL ARM
200 probe corrected transmission electron microscope (TEM),
operated at 200 kV. A cross-sectional TEM sample from a Al2O3/
graphene stack on a 90 nm SiO2/Si wafer was prepared using the FIB
lift-out method using a FEI Helios 650 DualBeam system. The
thickness of the Al2O3 layer was determined by a J.A. Woollam M-
2000D variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE).
2.2. Computational Methods.The binding energies of TMA on
pristine, O2, and H2 plasma functionalized graphene were calculated by
ab initio density functional theory (DFT). The calculations were
performed using the projector augmented wave function (PAW)26,27
as implemented in Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package ( VASP
v.5.3.5).28−31 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to
DFT32,33 was used with a plane-wave basis. The Perdew−Burke−
Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional34,35 was used along
with the DFT(PBE)-D3 method including the Becke-Jonson damp-
ing36 to account for van der Waals interactions on an empirical basis.
Eq 1 was used for computing the TMA adsorption (or, equivalently,
binding) energies through physisorption ( ΔEp) or chemisorption
(ΔEc) on a given graphene surface

where EPG is the total energy of the physisorbed/chemisorbed complex
of the TMA precursor with graphene, andEP and EG are the (gas
phase) total energies of the isolated precursor and the graphene
surface under consideration. Relevantly, the (reaction) energies (ΔEr =
ΔEc − ΔEp) required for converting the corresponding physisorbed

species into chemisorbed ones, e.g. via dissociation of the given
precursor on the given surface, are also presented. Gibbs free energy
changes (ΔG = Δ(Eelec + EZPE) − TΔS) associated with TMA
adsorption were estimated in the ideal gas limit at the typical ALD
conditions (T = 100 °C and P = 100 mTorr), accounting for the
translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions to the enthalpy
and entropy terms. All-atom vibrational analyses were performed using
the ﬁnite diﬀerences method implemented in VASP. Further details
about the computational calculations can be found in theSupporting
Information and elsewhere.37
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Surface Species Analysis by XPS.First the eﬀect of
the O2 and H2 plasma functionalization on graphene was
studied by XPS to analyze the surface groups created during the
plasma exposure. Before plasma exposure, the pristine graphene
samples were annealed at 400°C for 2 h in Ar/H2 (5%)
atmosphere for 2 h. This was done to minimize any polymer
residues left on the surface after transfer and ensure the cleanest
graphene possible. In the case of the O2 plasma treatment an
exposure time of 30 s was chosen, while for the H2 plasma 35 s
was used, both at a pressure of 50 mTorr and plasma power of
100 W. These are the optimal exposure times; longer exposures
resulted in irreversibly damaging the graphene as conﬁrmed by
Raman spectroscopy, whereas shorter exposures did not result
in a closed Al 2O3 layer (see discussion in the Supporting
Information and Figure S1).
The XPS measurements of the C 1s spectra of graphene after
a3 0sO 2 plasma treatment and a 35 s H2 plasma treatment are
shown in Figure 1. As a reference the spectrum of pristine
graphene after transfer to 90 nm SiO2 and 400°C anneal is also
shown in Figure 1. The main peak contributing to the C 1s
spectrum of pristine graphene (Figure 1a) is located at 284.4
eV and originates from thesp2 bonding of the carbon atoms.
The weak peak at 286.4 eV corresponds to C−O bonding.
These C−O bonds are commonly seen on the graphene basal
plane and originate from grain boundaries or defects sites38,39
or are the result of polymer residues remaining on the graphene
after its transfer to SiO2 and annealing.40 In addition, two
plasmon loss features observed at 290.4 and 293.2 eV are
caused by the interaction of the photoelectron with free
electrons present in the graphene.41
After a 30 s O2 plasma treatment (Figure 1b) the amount of
C−O bonds increases, indicating the creation of epoxide groups
(C−O−C) or hydroxide (C−OH) containing surface groups
on the graphene. Two additional peaks appear in the spectrum
compared to that of pristine graphene. The peak at 284.6 eV is
related tosp3 bonding of the carbon atoms. This is combined
with a decrease in sp2 bonding, which indicates that the O2
plasma treatment indeed disrupts the sp2 structure of the
graphene.41 The second peak appears at 289.0 eV and is related
to the creation of C O bonds, possibly in the form of
carbonyl groups. Since carbonyl groups can only be formed in-
plane due to theirsp2 carbon constituent, these are most likely
located at defects or edge sites of the graphene basal plane. The
plasmon loss features can no longer be observed after the O2
plasma treatment. This is likely due to the deterioration of the
electrical properties of the graphene after the plasma exposure.
The O 1s spectra of the graphene samples did not provide any
additional information on the C−O and CO bonding due to
the dominating contribution from the SiO2 substrate to the O
1s signal.
After a 35 s H2 plasma treatment (Figure 1c) the graphene
shows a strong increase in thesp3 bonding, combined with a
decrease in thesp2 bonding. This is most likely related to the
formation of C−H bonds (hydrogenated graphene),24 which
cannot be observed by XPS. A distinct hallmark of hydro-
genated graphene is the reversibility of hydrogenation upon
annealing at 400°C.25 This reversibility can be conﬁrmed by
Raman spectroscopy.24,25 After hydrogenation the Raman D-
band at 1350 cm−1, which is related to defects orsp3 bonding of
the carbon atoms, can be observed. This band disappears after
annealing at 400°C in Ar atmosphere, indicating that hydrogen
atoms desorb from the graphene surface at this temperature
and the original graphenesp2 conﬁguration is restored. This
reversibility of the D-band is also observed for the 35 s H2
plasma treated sample in this work (see below), indicating that
the graphene is indeed hydrogenated upon H2 plasma exposure.

Apart from a change fromsp2 to sp3 bonding the XPS also
shows an increase in the C−O bonding after the H2 plasma
treatment. This could be due to the formation of hydroxyl
groups upon H2 plasma exposure or adventitious carbon. The
hydroxyl groups could be formed by residual water desorbing
from the reactor walls and dissociating in the plasma, whereas
the adventitious carbon could be formed due to carbon
containing molecules present in the air adsorbing on the sample
during transfer to the XPS system. Summarizing, the XPS
results indicate that an O2 plasma creates a combination of
epoxide, hydroxide, and carbonyl groups on the graphene
surface. A hydrogen plasma most likely results in the creation of
C−H groups with some hydroxyl impurities.
3.2. Al2O3 ALD Growth on Functionalized Graphene.
To investigate the eﬀect of the created functional groups on the
uniformity of the Al 2O3 nucleation, 100 ALD cycles were
performed on the plasma treated samples. A pristine graphene
sample was added to the deposition as a reference. The
uniformity of the Al2O3 after deposition, determined by SEM
and AFM, is shown in Figure 2. On the pristine graphene
reference sample no uniform growth is obtained (Figure 2a,d).
Small holes and a granular Al2O3 structure are visible in both
the AFM and SEM images. The roughness, determined from an
average of three AFM scans (2× 2 μm2), is 1.9± 0.1 nm for
the pristine graphene sample after Al2O3 ALD. Both the 30 s O2
plasma (Figure 2b,e) and the 35 s H2 plasma (Figure 2c,f)
treated graphene show uniform deposition of Al 2O3.N o
pinholes are visible, and the roughness is considerably lower,
0.39 ± 0.05 nm and 0.45± 0.05 nm for the O2 and H2 plasma,
respectively, indicating that a closed Al2O3 layer is obtained.
The surface groups created on the graphene with the O2 and
H2 plasma pretreatments thus suﬃciently increase the ALD
precursor adsorption on graphene, enhancing the nucleation of
Al2O3 ALD and enabling uniform Al2O3 growth on graphene.
The thicknesses of the Al2O3 layers deposited on the O2 and
H2 plasma treated graphene have been determined with
spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) to be 11± 1 nm and 9± 1
nm, respectively. The higher thickness of the Al2O3 on the O2
plasma treated sample indicates a shorter nucleation delay of
the Al2O3 when an O2 plasma treatment is used. This is most
likely caused by a more favored adsorption of TMA precursor
molecules on epoxide (C −O−C) and hydroxyl (C −OH)
groups compared to hydrogen groups (C−H). This will be
discussed in more detail in theDFT section of this paper. The
shorter nucleation delay on O2 plasma treated graphene also
makes it possible to deposit thinner uniform Al2O3 layers on
the O2 treated samples (seeFigure S2). In the case of the O2
plasma treated graphene, the Al2O3 layer was already closed
after 50 cycles, corresponding to a layer thickness of
approximately 5 nm. Considering the H 2 plasma treated
samples, pinholes were still present in the layer after 75 ALD
cycles (seeFigure S2). This indicates that 100 ALD cycles is
the minimum required for a closed Al2O3 layer using H2 plasma
functionalization with the current plasma settings and exposure
time. Increasing the H2 plasma exposure time could help to
increase the coverage at lower ALD cycles numbers but can also
irreversibly damage the graphene (see discussion in the
Supporting Information).
To conﬁrm that the Al2O3 layer after a H2 plasma treatment
and 100 cycles Al2O3 ALD is indeed closed, a TEM cross-
section was made ( Figure 3 ). The cross-section shows a
uniform Al2O3 layer with a thickness of 7.8± 0.4 nm, which is
in agreement with the Al2O3 thickness obtained from the SE
measurements.
3.3. Quality of the Graphene: Raman Character-
ization. The above results show that uniform Al2O3 deposition

on graphene can be obtained by using an O2 and H2 plasma
pretreatment. However, it is generally observed that graphene is
damaged by such treatments.12,16,20,21 This is also indicated by
the XPS data in Figure 1, which show the conversion ofsp2
bonds to sp3 bonds. In this regard, the quality of the graphene
was studied before the plasma treatment, after the plasma
treatment, after ALD, and after annealing at 400°C using
Raman spectroscopy and Hall measurements (next section).
The Raman measurements performed after each processing
step for the diﬀerent graphene samples are shown inFigure 4.
The Raman D-band (∼1350 cm−1) is related to defects in the
graphene or to the functionalization of graphene by covalent
bonding.42 Pristine graphene (Figure 4a) shows no D-band
indicating that the graphene is of high quality. Subsequent
Al2O3 ALD on the pristine graphene does not create any
defects in the graphene but also does not result in the
formation of a closed Al2O3 layer. Annealing the pristine
graphene with Al2O3 at 400°C for 2 h in a 50:1 Ar/H2 mixture
results in the formation of a small D-band and anα-carbon
background (∼1200−1500 cm−1), which could be due to the
dehydrogenation of the polymer residues present at the
graphene surface. These residues are a result of the graphene
transfer process.40 Even though the graphene was annealed
before ALD to minimize the residues, it has appeared
impossible to remove them completely.40
Treating the graphene with a 30 s O 2 plasma creates a
signiﬁcant D-band (Figure 4b) as a result of the conversion of
sp2 to sp3 carbon (also shown by XPS) and possibly by the
creation of defects due to ion bombardment. After Al2O3 ALD
the magnitude of the D-band decreases considerably, indicating
that the ALD process is able to partially heal the defects
introduced by the plasma pretreatment or remove functional
groups present on the graphene. This could be due to a
reaction of the ALD precursor molecules with the functional
groups or the passivation of defects by Al2O3.43 In an attempt
to further reduce the D-band, the sample was annealed at 400
°C under the same conditions as the pristine graphene.
Although this reduced the D-band further, it could not be
completely removed. Possibly, the species in the O2 plasma
irreversibly damaged the graphene, or part of the functional
groups remains on the graphene.
In the case of a 35 s H2 plasma treatment, a similar trend as
for the O2 plasma treated sample can be observed by Raman
spectroscopy (Figure 4c). Similar to the O2 plasma the H2
plasma results in the appearance of a D-band in the Raman
spectrum. The D-band after H 2 plasma treatment is lower
compared to the D-band created after O2 plasma treatment.
Subsequent Al2O3 ALD leads to a reduction of these defects or
removal of the C −H functional groups from the surface.
Annealing the H2 plasma treated sample with Al2O3 at 400 °C
results in the complete annihilation of the D-band. The Raman
spectrum obtained after annealing is similar to the pristine
graphene spectrum obtained after transfer to the SiO2 substrate.
This points in the direction that the D-band is indeed related to
C−H bonds, which can be removed after annealing at 400°C,
as defects are not likely to be annealed at this temperature.24 It
should be noted that for hydrogenated graphene also a weak
D′-band (∼1620 cm−1) should be present. 42 This peak is
however not distinguishable inFigure 4c, because the G-band
(∼1600 cm−1) is signiﬁcantly broadened upon annealing the
pristine graphene to remove the PMMA residue, thus
introducing overlap with the D′ band. This broadening is
related to the formation of small amounts of amorphous carbon
during the anneal on top of the graphene.44 Direct H2 plasma
exposure of pristine graphene (without annealing) does result
in the formation of a distinguishable D′-band (data not shown).
3.4. Quality of the Graphene: Hall Mobility Character-
ization. Hall mobility measurements were performed to
investigate the eﬀect of the O2 and H2 plasma treatments on
the electrical properties of graphene (Figure 5). The mobility
values of the pristine graphene samples used in this study range
between 1300 and 1800 cm2/(V s) (indicated by the black bars
in Figure 5) which is typical for large area (1× 1c m2) CVD
graphene.3,45,46 The deposition of Al2O3 on pristine graphene
results in a mobility increase to 117% of its initial value (1520

graphene, and c) 35 s H2 plasma treated graphene. The spectra are

cm2/(V s)). This increase could be caused by several eﬀects:
(1) Al2O3 can passivate defects present in the graphene;47 (2)
Al2O3 can act as a barrier preventing H2O and O2 reaching the
graphene surface which would otherwise degrade the carrier
mobility of graphene;48 (3) The Al2O3 layer can also help to
screen charged impurities, present in the SiO2 substrate, which
would normally act as scattering centers for the electrons and
holes in the graphene.49 Charge screening could also explain
why the mobility is further increased to 140% of its initial value
(1860 cm2/(V s)) after the sample is annealed at 400°C. This
is because annealing Al2O3 at 400°C generally gives the highest
Al2O3 built-in charge,50 resulting in maximum passivation and
an increased mobility of the graphene after annealing. It should
be noted though that the Al2O3 layer on pristine graphene is
not closed and therefore not suited for applications, for
example as a gate dielectric.
Figure 5 also shows that both the O 2 and H2 plasma
treatments reduce the charge carrier mobility of graphene, as
expected. After O2 plasma the mobility is reduced to 195 cm2/
(V s) (11% of its initial value), whereas after a H2 plasma the
mobility is decreased to 467 cm2/(V s) (32% of its initial
value). This is in line with the XPS and Raman data which show
the conversion ofsp2 to sp3 carbon. The out-of-plane bonds act
as scattering centers for the electrons and holes in the graphene
and therefore lower the mobility.
Al2O3 ALD on the O2 plasma treated sample causes a partial
recovery of the mobility to 78% of its initial value (1390 cm2/
(V s)), most likely due to passivation and barrier properties of
Al2O3, as was discussed for ALD on pristine graphene above.
Additionally, part of the functional groups or defects might be
removed from the surface by the precursor molecules during
Al2O3 ALD. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the
observed decrease of the D-band in the Raman spectrum after
Al2O3 ALD (Figure 4b). The DFT section of this paper will
elaborate further on this hypothesis. The charge carrier mobility
of the O2 plasma treated graphene sample with Al2O3 can be
recovered to 91% of its original value (1630 cm2/(V s)) by
annealing at 400°C. The recovery is most likely a result of the
improved passivation properties of the Al2O3, as observed for
the pristine sample. Additionally, some functional groups on
the graphene desorb during the annealing, indicated by a
further decrease in the Raman D-band (Figure 4 b). The
functional groups removed could be primarily hydroxyl groups,
which have limited stability on graphene (see discussion in the
DFT section). The incomplete recovery of the mobility after
annealing indicates that some defects or functional groups
remain on the O2 plasma treated sample, which is conﬁrmed by
the still observable D-band in the Raman spectra.
Al2O3 ALD on the H2 plasma treated graphene results in a
large mobility improvement from 32% (467 cm2/(V s), after
the H2 plasma treatment) to 102% of its initial value (1470
cm2/(V s), after 100 ALD cycles). As for the O 2 plasma
treatment, this recovery is most likely caused by a combination
of the passivation and barrier properties of Al2O3 and a partial
removal of the surface groups. Likewise, the removal of surface
groups is supported by the decrease of the D-band in the
Raman spectrum after Al2O3 ALD (Figure 4c). Compared to
the O2 plasma treatment, the D-band is considerably weaker for
the H2 plasma treatment after ALD, indicating that the groups
created by the H 2 plasma treatment can be more easily
removed, which explains the higher mobility recovery.
Annealing the sample at 400°C further improves the mobility
to 152% of its original value (2190 cm2/(V s)). The absence of
a D-band in the Raman spectrum after annealing the H2 plasma
treated samples explains the larger increase of the mobility
compared to the O2 treatment. This also shows that the H2
plasma treatment is fully reversible and that the functional
groups created by the plasma treatment can be removed by a
400 °C anneal.

The additional improvement of the mobility observed after
Al2O3 ALD and annealing for the H2 treated sample compared
to the pristine graphene sample (152% vs 140%) could be
caused by the removal of polymer residues from the graphene
surface during the plasma exposure. To investigate this possible
cleaning eﬀect, a graphene sample, which wasﬁrst annealed at
400 °C, was hydrogenated and subsequently annealed at 200
°C for 2 h and 400°C for 2 h without performing Al2O3 ALD
(Figure 6). Raman spectroscopy (Figure 6a) shows that after
annealing at 400 °C the graphene is recovered to its original
state without functionalization. Figure 6b shows that this is
accompanied by an increase in the mobility to 134% of its
original value. This indicates that the H2 plasma indeed
removes polymer residuals from the surface and explains the
additional improvement observed compared to pristine
graphene.
The removal of polymer residues possibly also occurs during
the O2 plasma treatment.19 However, no mobility improvement
is observed for the O2 plasma sample. Most likely, the mobility
decrease due to the remaining functional groups is larger than
the mobility increase due to polymer residue removal.
3.5. DFT Simulations.To further understand the enhanced
Al2O3 nucleation on O2 and H2 plasma treated grapheneﬁrst-
principles (ab initio) DFT simulations were performed. To this
end, models of pristine, oxygenated graphene (graphene oxide),
and hydrogenated graphene were created (Figure S3 ). In
principle functional groups can be attached to one or both
facets of graphene, leading to single-sided or double-sided
functionalization. However, one should note that graphene is
placed on a Si/SiO 2 substrate during the O 2/H2 plasma
pretreatments, and the functionalities will therefore be
predominantly attached to the accessible side rather than
both sides. In view of this, the current DFT analysis is limited
to the single-sided varieties (unless stated otherwise). Besides,
the SiO2 substrate is shown to only have a very limited eﬀect on
the TMA precursor adsorption (see the SI, Section 5).
Considering this and the concomitant computational eﬀorts,
the SiO2 substrate was not included in the simulation models
used for the further analysis.
Pristine graphene (PG) was modeled by an 8× 8 graphene
supercell. For graphene oxide (GO) several models were
considered accounting for the diﬀerent oxygen-containing
surface groups observed by XPS (Figure 1). Unlike epoxidized
graphene, it turned out that single-sided hydroxylated graphene
was not stable upon TMA binding due to the detaching−OH
groups, as evident from the molecular dynamics simulations at
ﬁnite temperature (data not shown). Therefore, double-sided
hydroxylated graphene was used to simulate the TMA binding
on hydroxylated graphene. In contrast, the hydroxyl groups
were stable on the single-sided GO mixture, containing
nonordered decoration of epoxy, hydroxyl, and hydrogen. For
hydrogenated graphene (HG), the two most-likely conﬁg-
urations of the single-sided HG were modeled. A detailed
discussion regarding the choice of these models can be found in
theSupporting Information (HG) and elsewhere (PG and
GO).37
The TMA precursor physisorption ( ΔEp), chemisorption
(ΔEc), and reaction energies ( ΔEr = ΔEc − ΔEp) were
calculated for each of the model systems. For computing the
chemisorption energies, several reaction pathways were
considered

X−H denotes that the surface site is H-terminated and an
asterisk refers to a surface group, whereas Me stands for a
methyl (−CH3) group. Other reaction pathways are possible
depending on the ALD temperature, simultaneous binding of

etc. However, the approach used here provides suﬃcient
information for a qualitative comparison of the binding energies
and is commonly used for studying ALD processes on
graphene37,51,52 and other substrates.53,54
The results of TMA physisorption and chemisorption on the
diﬀerent graphene model systems are compiled in Table 1,
whereas the corresponding minimum-energy structures of the
physisorbed and chemisorbed species for the most relevant
pathways are shown inFigure 7. A complete overview of all
considered reaction pathways can be found in theSupporting
Information (Figure S4).
Pristine graphene has a high chemical stability due to thesp2-
carbon conﬁguration. This results in a rather weak TMA
physisorption ( ΔEp = −0.53 eV) accompanied by an
unfavorable (endothermic) chemical binding of TMA (ΔEc =
1.84 eV). The dissociative TMA binding preferably proceeds
via a methyl transfer mechanism (eq 2a), which involves a high
activation energy ( ΔEa = 3.60 eV, see Figure S5 for the
minimum-energy path). The other investigated reaction
pathways do not lead to Al bonding on the graphene (Figure
S4) which is required for proper Al 2O3 nucleation. This
indicates that TMA adsorption on PG is kinetically and
thermodynamically unfavorable, which is in agreement with the
SEM and AFM results (Figure 2a,d), showing nonuniform
coverage of Al2O3 on pristine graphene. Nucleation probably
starts at defect sites and grain boundaries with enhanced
chemical reactivity, while no growth occurs on the pristine
graphene. This results in the observed island-like growth
instead of a uniform smooth Al2O3 layer due to the unfavorable
TMA adsorption on the graphene plane.
Graphene oxide, however, can facilitate uniform nucleation
and growth for Al 2O3 ALD ( Figure 2 b,e and also else-
where20,21). In line with this, the DFT calculations indicate a
stronger TMA adsorption on all considered GO surfaces,
compared to PG (Table 1 , Figure S3 ). Stronger TMA
adsorption on GO can be attributed to the availability of p-
orbitals of the surface oxygen that interact with those of TMA
aluminum. Among the diﬀerent models, GO with ordered
epoxy groups provides the strongest adsorption of TMA, due to
having the highest free-electron density. High binding aﬃnities
are obtained for epoxidized GO, as evident from the
physisorption and chemisorption energies (ΔEp = −1.70 eV
and ΔEc = −7.37 eV). Compared to epoxidized GO,
hydroxylated GO provides a weaker TMA adsorption (ΔEp =
−0.45 eV andΔEc = −2.67 eV), likely due to the H-passivation
eﬀect (i.e., reduced availability of free-electrons) of the oxygen.
Likewise, a mixture of these two oxygen-containing function-
alities provides an intermediate TMA binding strength (ΔEp =
−0.61 eV and ΔEc = −5.33 eV). Considering the DFT
calculations, it becomes clear that O2 plasma pretreatments

enable an improved ALD nuc leation by predominantly
attaching epoxy groups which have a strong binding aﬃnity
toward TMA.
From the analysis of the energetically most plausible
pathways predicted for the TMA chemisorption on the GO
surfaces (Table 1 and Figure 7), a variation depending on the
surface functionalization can be observed. On single-sided
epoxidized GO, TMA preferably chemisorbs trifunctionally
(through three surface epoxys) while releasing a volatile ethane
(Me2 or C2H6) product (eq 2b, Figure 7). The latter proceeds
with a negligible barrier (ΔEa = 0.04 eV, Figure S6), while
gaining substantial energy in return (ΔEc = −7.37 eV). The
methyl transfer mechanism (eq 2a, Figure S3) for binding TMA
on epoxidized GO is energetically less favorable (ΔEc = −5.67
eV), making it less probab le than the ethane release
mechanism. TMA chemisorption on hydroxylated GO is
predicted to proceed via the methane (CH4) release pathway
(eq 3a), in agreement with other−OH terminated substrates
such as SiO2,A l2O3, and TiO2.55 This reaction proceeds via a
low barrier as well (ΔEa= 0.09 eV,Figure S6) and produces a
sizable energy gain (ΔEr = −2.22 eV), rendering it accessible
from both the kinetic and thermodynamic aspect. Dissociative
TMA adsorption on the GO surface with a mixture of epoxy
and hydroxyl groups will undergo either the methane- and
ethane-release mechanism, depending on the actual surface
composition. For the mixture model considered here (with 33%
coverage) the ethane release mechanism is more likely to occur
(ΔEr = −4.72 vs −2.91 eV).
DFT calculations indicate a weaker TMA binding for the
hydrogenated graphene (HG), compared to GO, but the
binding is still stronger than for PG (Table 1 ). TMA
physisorption on honeycomb and stirrup HG is of average
strength (ΔEp = −0.54 eV vs −0.44 eV). The dissociative
binding of TMA is energetically favorable on both surfaces,
whereas the stirrup conﬁguration aﬀords a somewhat stronger
binding (ΔEc = −2.23 eV vs −1.39 eV). The DFT results
indicate that chemisorption proceeds most likely via the CH4-
release mechanism, as for the hydroxylated GO surface.
However, diﬀerent from the hydroxylated GO, dissociative
binding of TMA (i.e., CH4 formation) is preceded by a release
of gaseous H2 in order to facilitate the binding (eqs 3c−3d).
This two-step chemisorption scheme is thermodynamically and
kinetically accessible on both single-sided HG surfaces by being
energetically downhill (ΔEr = −1.69 eV and −0.95 eV) and
having low activation barriers (ΔEa = 0.18 and 0.17 eV, on
stirrup and honeycom b respectively, see Figure S7a,b ).
However, compared to the various GO (see above), TMA
chemisorption on HG surfaces is kinetically and thermody-
namically less favorable, slowing down the TMA adsorption.
Thisﬁnding falls in line with the longer nucleation delay on
HG in comparison to GO observed experimentally (Figure S2).
All the discussions are so far based on the zero-temperature
gas-phase energies. To check the temperature and pressure
eﬀects on the reaction pathways, Gibbs free energy changes are
also computed ( Table 1 ), mimicking the typical ALD
conditions during the precursor pulse (T = 100 °C and P =
13.3 Pa). As evident from the free energies, higher temperatures
are expected to cause an overall weaker TMA physisorption (on
all studied surfaces), most likely due to the decrease in the
translational and rotational entropies of gaseous precursor
molecules. This in turn would enhance the TMA desorption
rate with increasing temperatures; however, this can be
compensated by the simultaneous adsorption of multiple
precursor molecules (as previously shown for TMA binding
on Al 2O3
56). Besides, with more destabilized physisorbed
species, the reaction energies are in general more negative at
elevated temperatures (Table 1), rendering these reactions
thermodynamically even more favored. It should also be noted
that the energetically most feasible pathway for each considered
surface remains the same as in the zero-temperature case, when
temperature and pressure eﬀects are also considered.
Considering the variety in the reaction mechanisms
employed for the dissociative binding of TMA on diverse
graphene surfaces, an overview is given inFigure 8. The most
plausible pathway for hydrogenated graphene that combines H2
and CH4 release mechanisms is predicted to clean the hydrogen
functionalities oﬀ the surface (typically three hydrogens per
bound TMA molecule). In contrast, on the GO surfaces, the
oxygen adatoms are predicted to stay on the graphene surface
on all feasible pathways. This is the likely reason for the
observed reversibility of the H2 plasma treatment after Al2O3
ALD as opposed to O2 plasma treaded graphene (seeFigure 4).
4. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, uniform Al2O3 ALD growth on graphene was
obtained by functionalizing graphene with a reversible H 2
plasma treatment, without deteriorating the graphene ’s
electrical properties. The creation of C −H groups on the
graphene surface during plasma treatment improved the
adsorption of the ALD precursor TMA on graphene. This
led to the formation of a closed uniform Al2O3 layer. On
pristine graphene a closed ﬁlm was not obtained due to the
absence of dangling bonds and the resulting high activation
barrier for TMA adsorption. DFT calculations conﬁrmed the
improved precursor adsorption on hydrogenated graphene. As
for oxygen plasma treatments, the hydrogen plasma treatment
led to the partial deterioration of the sp2 hybridization of the
graphene, which resulted in a drastic reduction in charge carrier
mobility. Contrary to oxygen plasma functionalized graphene,
for hydrogen plasma functionalized graphene this reduction in
charge carrier mobility was fully recovered upon Al2O3 ALD.
Subsequent annealing at 400°C further improved the mobility
to 152% of its initial value. DFT calculations showed that the
recovery of charge carrier mobility can be explained by a

reaction pathway, in which TMA adsorption on hydrogenated
graphene proceeds via a CH4 release mechanism preceded by
the abstraction of H2 from the surface, which recovers the sp2
hybridization of graphene. The DFT predictions were
conﬁrmed by Raman spectroscopy. Factors that could explain
the improvement of the charge carrier mobility of the graphene
beyond its initial value are (1) the excellent barrier properties of
the ALD Al2O3 after annealing, (2) screening of charged
impurity by Al2O3, and (3) the removal of resist residues by the
H2 plasma treatment. Functionalization of graphene by H 2
plasma treatments is therefore an excellent way to enable direct
ALD growth of thin uniform dielectric layers on graphene
without deteriorating graphene’s electrical properties.
