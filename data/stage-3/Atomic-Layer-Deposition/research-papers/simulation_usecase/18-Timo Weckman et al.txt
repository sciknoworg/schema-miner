First principles study of the atomic layer
deposition of alumina by TMA–H2O-process
Timo Weckman* and Kari Laasonen
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a coating technology used to produce highly uniform thin films.
Aluminiumoxide, Al 2O3, is mainly deposited using trimethylaluminium (TMA) and water as precursors and
is the most studied ALD-process to date. However, only few theoretical studies have been reported in
the literature. The surface reaction mechanisms and energetics previously reported focus on a gibbsite-
like surface model but a more realistic description of the surface can be achieved when the
hydroxylation of the surface is taken into account using dissociatively adsorbed water molecules. The
adsorbed water changes the structure of the surface and reaction energetics change considerably
when compared to previously studied surface model. Here we have studied the TMA–H2O process using
density functional theory on a hydroxylated alumina surface and reproduced the previous results
for comparison. Mechanisms and energetics during both the TMA and the subsequent water pulse are
presented. TMA is found to adsorb exothermically onto the surface. The reaction barriers for the ligand-
exchange reactions between the TMA and the surface hydroxyl groups were found to be much lower
compared to previously presented results. TMA dissociation on the surface is predicted to saturate at
monomethylaluminium. Barriers for proton diffusion between surface sites are observed to be low. TMA
adsorption was also found to be cooperative with the formation of methyl bridges between the adsorbants.
The water pulse was studied using single water molecules reacting with the DMA and MMA surface species.
Barriers for these reactions were found to reasonable in the process conditions. However, stabilizing inter-
actions amongst water molecules were found to lower the reaction barriers and the dynamical nature of
water is predicted to be of importance. It is expected that these calculations can only set an upper limit for
the barriers during the water pulse.
1 Introduction
Atomic layer deposition is a coating technology used for the
construction of various thin films. ALD is based on sequential,
self-terminating gas–solid reactions. A prototype process is
based on two precursors that react rapidly and violently with
each other. The reaction between the precursors is forced onto
the surface by alternating gas pulses while the gas-phase
reactions are avoided by purging the reactor with inert gas
between the pulses. Ideally each precursor pulse forms a new
monolayer onto the surface. A vast majority of the ALD-processes
are run at temperatures higher than 400 K. The choice for the
precursors is therefore crucial for the process as there should be
no reactions amongst the precursors themselves in order for the
adsorption process to be self-terminating. The self-limiting nat-
ure of the adsorption in ALD enables a highly uniform and
conformal deposition of a material with thickness control at
the atomic level.1–3
The trimethylaluminium–water-process is perhaps the most
studied ALD-process. Because of the ideally self-terminating
nature of the adsorption process and inertness of the reaction
by-product methane, the TMA–H2O-system is considered as a
model process for ALD 3,4 and is worth a careful study. However,
only few theoretical studies have been published hitherto
and most of the research concerning the process has been
experimental work. Here we try to bridge this gap by revisiting
some of the results previously published in the literature
and also present reaction pathways for the initial reactions
in the process.
The produced thin film, aluminum oxide (Al 2O3), is an
important dielectric material with a large band gap of 9 eV
and moderate permittivity. Its various commercial applications
include flat-screen electroluminescent displays, protective coating,
read/write heads, DRAM and it has been considered as a gate
dielectric in complementary metal–oxide-semiconductors,
CMOS.5–8 The total reaction of the process is

This overall reaction is often divided into two parts, one
‘‘half-reaction’’ for the TMA-pulse and another one for the
water-pulse (surface is described here with a J)4
J–OH + Al(CH 3)3 - J–O–Al(CH3)2 +C H 4 (R1)
J–O–Al(CH3)2 +H 2O - J–O–Al(CH3)OH + CH 4
(R2)
In addition to the straight-forward ligand-exchange reaction
in eqn (R1), a reaction simultaneously with two hydroxyl groups
has also been proposed 9
2 J–OH + Al(CH 3)3 - J(–O)2–Al(CH3) + 2CH 4 (R3)
TMA has also been observed to adsorb dissociatively onto
the oxygen bridges on the surface. 4
Previously only few computational studies considering the
TMA–H2O-system has been presented, focusing mainly on
mechanisms (R1) and (R2). The first publications on the growth
of Al 2O3 thin films was done using cluster models 10,11 consist-
ing of only about a dozen atoms. Few papers 12–14 using
the periodic slab model with gibbsite-like Al(OH) 3-surface
describing the hydroxylated alumina have been published.
As alumina is almost always covered with either dissociated
or molecularly adsorbed water, hydroxylation is of great impor-
tance for alumina’s surface chemistry. For example the growth-
per-cycle (GPC) of the TMA–H 2O-process has been observed
to be linearly dependent on the hydroxylation of the surface. 4
This hydroxylation of the alumina surface has been taken into
account in the computational studies using a gibbsite-like
Al(OH)3 surface structure. However, this proposed model
by Elliott et al.15 neglects the finite temperature effects of the
hydroxylation. A more comprehensive study of the surface
composition by Lodzianaet al.16 shows that the gibbsite-like
surface exists only under large water partial pressures and low
temperatures ( o400 K) and is not thermodynamically stable
in the process conditions (typical pulse conditions: P = 2 Pa, T =
450 K). In low pressures the surface structure is not planar as
is the case with gibbsite-like surface, but dissociated water
introduces two kinds of hydroxyl groups, one being higher than
the other. This has large effects on the previously reported
reaction mechanisms and energetics. The surface structure
presented by Lodziana et al.is from here on called the hydroxyl-
ated surface model in contrast to the previously used gibbsite
surface model.
Here we present detailed energetics of the initial reaction
pathways on the hydroxylated surface during the TMA pulse
and compare the results to the previously used gibbsite-like
surface model. The dimethylaluminium and monomethyl-
aluminium end-products from the TMA molecule calculations
are used to approximate surface sites at the end of the TMA
pulse in order to study the energetics during the water pulse.
From these results the energetics at a finite temperature and
pressure are constructed and kinetic parameters for the reactions
are computed, allowing the course of the surface process to be
extrapolated.
2 Computational methods
2.1 Technical details
The reaction pathways were studied using self-consistent
density functional theory as implemented in GPAW. 17 The
exchange and correlation part of the total energy was treated
with gradient corrected Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional18
using grid spacing of 0.2 Å. The TS09 van der Waals correction
on top of the PBE functional was used as proposed by Tkatchenko
and Scheffler.19 The k-points sampling of the reciprocal space was
done using 2 /C2 2 /C2 2 Monkhorst–Pack grid for bulk calculations
and 2 /C2 2 /C2 1 for the surface calculations. All geometry optimiza-
tions were carried out to gradients smaller than 0.05 eV Å/C0 1. Partial
charge analysis was conducted fr om the electron density with a
Bader analysis.20
Free energies of the reaction pathways were estimated in the
ideal gas limit. The Gibbs free energy diﬀerence between two
states was calculated as
DG = D(Eelec + EZPE) /C0 TDS (1)
where the Eelec is the electronic and EZPE the zero-point energy
of a state. DS is the change in entropy between two states.
Rotational and translational energy contributions were also
included for the gaseous molecules.
The translational entropy of the gaseous molecules was
estimated using the Sackur–Tetrode equation

where s is the symmetry number corresponding to the mole-

the principal moments of inertia. Bond vibrations were treated
as harmonic oscillations:21

To reduce the computational burden associated with vibra-
tional calculations on the solid surface the vibrations on the
surface were restricted only to the top layer and bulk modes
were assumed to remain unchanged. To avoid erroneous con-
tributions from low frequency modes, modes corresponding to
wavenumber less than 209 cm/C0 1 (equal to 300 K) were omitted
from the partition function.
In order to study the surface reactions, the kinetic rates were
quantified. Reaction rate coeﬃcients for the surface reactions

where the P is the pressure of the adsorbant, m is mass of the
precursor molecule and Ai is the area of the adsorption site i.
In our calculations the area of adsorption site is taken as the
reciprocal of the surface concentration.s(T,y) is the sticking
probability of the adsorbant, which is unity at low surface
coverage.
The minimum energy paths (MEP) for transition states were
found using the nudged elastic band method 23 where the
potential energy surfaces first-order saddle point for transition
from initial to final state is found by setting consecutive images
of the system along the reaction path. These replicas are
connected to each other by a harmonic force and relaxed along
the MEP. The initial guess of the path was created by inter-
polating the configurations between the initial and final geo-
metries. Transition state was found using the so-called climbing
image method with alternating force constants.
2.2 Substrate models
During ALD growth amorphous alumina is deposited onto
the substrate. However, amorphous structure is diﬃcult to
simulateab initio,s oa a-Al2O3 crystalline structure was chosen
as in previous studies. 12,13,15,24 The a-Al2O3 (0001) surface has
been studied both experimentally and theoretically 25–29 and the
Al-terminated surface has been shown to be the most stable
surface ofa-Al2O3.
The surface was modelled using the slab model with periodic
boundary conditions imposed. Thickness of the slab was six
Al2O3-layers as in previous calculations. 12,16 The convergence of
the surface relaxation energy with diﬀerent slab thicknesses was
tested and was found to be in good agreement with those
presented in the literature. 30 The bottom layers of the slab were
constrained for the calculations. The surface cells consisted of
2/C2 2 unit cells (in total 120 atoms) with surface area of 0.82 nm 2.
The surface hydroxylation was taken into account using
dissociatively adsorbed water surface presented by Lodziana
et al.16 The resulting hydroxylated surface has a hydroxyl group
coverage of about 16 mmol m /C0 2 that is very close to the
experimental value of 15 mmol m /C0 2.31 The gibbsite-like surface
is constructed by replacing the top-most aluminium atoms with
three hydrogen atoms. Hydroxyl concentration on the gibbsite-
like surface is about 25mmol m/C0 2. The previous study by Elliott
and Greer 12 using gibbsite-like surface was also repeated for
comparison.
The adsorption energy for the dissociatively adsorbed water
molecules was calculated as an average over all the adsorbed
water molecules in the monolayer,
Eads ¼ Eslab /C0 EAl2O3 /C0 NEH2O
N (7)
where EAl2O3 is bare aluminium slab or the previously filled
monolayer and EH2O is a single water molecule in a vacuum. 32
3 Results
Both the TMA and water pulses were studied. The TMA adsorp-
tion and subsequent ligand-exchange reactions were studied on
the hydroxylated and on the gibbsite-like surface. The water
pulse was studied with few water molecules using the DMA and
MMA surface species as the initial configuration.
The main mechanisms studied can be summed up by the
following reaction equations:
J–OH + Al(CH 3)3 - J–O–Al(CH3)2 +C H 4 (1a)
J–OH + J–O–Al(CH3)2 - (J–O)2–Al(CH3)+C H 4
(1b)
J–OH + ( J–O)2–Al(CH3) - (J–O)3–Al + CH 4 (1c)
J–O–Al(CH3)2 +H 2O - J–O–Al(CH3)OH + CH 4
(2a)
J–O–Al(CH3)OH + H 2O - J–O–Al(OH)2 +C H 4 (2b)
(J–O)2–Al(CH3)+H 2O - (J–O)2–Al(OH) + CH 4 (2c)
Eqn (1a)–(1c) represent reactions during the TMA pulse and
(2a)–(2c) reactions during the water pulse. Some additional
calculations were also done,e.g. the effect of several adsorbants
during the TMA pulse, and will be discussed in the text. The main
reaction mechanisms were treated with a vibrational analysis and
the free energies for these reactions were calculated.
In the reaction (1a) the TMA is decomposed into dimethyl-
aluminium (DMA) surface species and in the second reaction
reacts with the surface even further to produce a monomethyl-
aluminium (MMA). These two products are taken as the starting
points for the water pulse. Water pulse reactions were studied
with only a single TMA molecule in a 2/C2 2 unit cell representing
low TMA coverage.
3.1 Alumina – bulk and surface
The bulk oxide model was optimized using DFT by scanning
the potential energy surface by changing the lattice vectors
and keeping the lattice angles constant. The optimized cell
parameters were found to bea = b = 4.762 Å and c/a = 2.760 in
close agreement with both experiment 33 and other theoretical
studies.12,16
In the original paper by Lodziana et al. no van der Waals-
correction was used, so we present our results with and without
the vdW-correction for clearer comparison. The calculated
heat of adsorption for water with diﬀerent surface coverages
is given in Table 1. The general trend in the results is in good

agreement with the previous results. The bonding energies
using only the PBE-functional are slightly smaller than the
obtained using the similar PW91-functional.
As can be expected, the inclusion of the van der Waals-
correction increases the adsorption energy overall when com-
pared to the pure functional. The diﬀerence is in the order of
/C00.3 to /C0 0.1 eV per water molecule. Especially the adhesion of
the second monolayer is increased when compared to the pure
functionals PW91 and PBE. With the addition of the third
monolayer, the van der Waals correction has little diﬀerence
to the energies obtained using the pure functional.
Adsorbed water produces surface structure that has two
distinct hydroxyl groups (see Fig. 1). The higher hydroxyl
groups are formed from the water molecule and the lower is
formed from the dissociated hydrogen that bonds to a surface
oxygen. TMA adsorption is possible only onto to higher hydroxyl
group due to steric eﬀects.
The gibbsite-like surface was constructed by replacing
the top Al-atoms with three hydrogen atoms. Two of these
hydrogens orient vertically and one horizontally with respect
to the surface (Fig. 2). Adsorption to the horizontal group is
preferred due to the possible Lewis acid–base reaction between
the TMA and the oxygens lone pair of electrons, but adsorption
to the vertical group was also found to be possible.
The diﬀerences in the surface geometries cause a diﬀerence
in the electronic structures between the two models. There is
however only small diﬀerence in the bond lengths and partial
charges between the two surfaces. All the Al–O bonds in the
bulk phase are 1.9–2.0 Å and partial charges 2.5 and/C0 1.6
for aluminium and oxygen, respectively. On the gibbsite-like
surface Al–O bonds are close to the bulk values but on the
hydroxylated surface they are slightly shorter (1.7 Å). Partial
charges on the surface atoms are slightly smaller than in the
bulk on both surfaces.
3.2 Reactions during the TMA pulse
3.2.1 TMA adsorption and first dissociation.On the hydroxyl-
ated surface the TMA adsorption takes place on one of the higher
hydroxyl groups. Adsorption to the lower hydroxyl groups if
blocked by steric interaction. The adsorption was found to be
exothermic with adsorption energy of/C0 1.13 eV. Any translational
motion between adsorption sites on the surface is blocked by a
diﬀusion barrier of 0.88 eV.
A straight-forward ligand-exchange reaction with the adsor-
bent hydroxyl groups was assumed to take place as in mechanism
(1a). The TMAs methyl group forms a methane molecule with the
proton of the hydroxyl group and desorbs into the gas phase.
Barrier for this ligand-exchange reaction was found to be only
0.35 eV with reaction energy of/C0 0.70 eV.
The same mechanism was also studied on the gibbsite-like
surface. Just as previously shown by Elliott and Greer, 12 the
TMA most favourably adsorbs onto the horizontal hydroxyl
group. The adsorption energy to the horizontal group was
/C01.60 eV, considerably more exothermic than on the hydroxyl-
ated surface. However, we found that for the ligand-exchange
reaction TMA preferably bonds to a vertical hydroxyl group
where the proton is more accessible. Adsorption energy directly
to the vertical hydroxyl group would be/C0 1.52 eV. The reaction
barrier for the reaction is 0.69 eV in agreement with the
previously reported result of 0.9 eV by Elliott and Pinto. 13 At
the end of the reaction DMA is coordinated to two oxygens which
makes the configuration very stable. The overall reaction energy
after the desorption of methane was/C0 0.88 eV. The adsorbed
TMA on the two diﬀerent surfaces is illustrated in Fig. 3.

molecules are visible from this view due to overlap.

The transition and final states on both surface models are
illustrated in Fig. 4.
While TMA adsorbs exothermically on both surfaces, the
adsorption energy on the gibbsite-surface is 0.5 eV more
negative than on the hydroxylated surface. Yet, there is very
little diﬀerence between the adsorption bonds lengths (Al–O
bond 2.04 Å and 2.02 Å on the hydroxylated and gibbsite
surface, respectively). The TMA is more distorted from its
gaseous planar structure on the gibbsite-like surface probably
because of the stronger Al–O adsorption bond. The C–Al–C–C-
dihedral changes from the planar 180 1 to about 240 1 on the
adsorption to the gibbsite surface, which is considerably more
than the distortion on the hydroxylated surface where the
dihedral is only about 2181. The distortion can also be partially
due to steric interactions between the methyl-ligands and the
neighbouring hydroxyl groups. The distance between the
methyl and hydroxyl groups is 0.5 Å shorter on the gibbsite-
surface than on the hydroxylated surface.
Fig. 3 Adsorbed TMA on the hydroxylated surface (left) and on the gibbsite surface (right). Brown, red, black and white spheres represent aluminium,
oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, respectively. The TMA is more distorted from its planar structure on the gibbsite surface than on the hydroxylated surfa ce.
However, the adsorption energy on the gibbsite-surface is 0.5 eV more exothermic than on the hydroxylated surface. There is no diﬀerences in the
adsorption bond lengths between the two surface models.
Fig. 4 On the left is the transition state for the initial reaction on the hydroxylated surface (top) and on the gibbsite-like surface (below). The TMA is less
hindered on the hydroxylated surface and the transition state is more easily reached. On the right side is the final state after the ligand-exchange re action.
The DMA is coordinated to one oxygen on the hydroxylated surface but twice coordinated on the gibbsite-like surface. On the hydroxylated surface,
adding another TMA onto a neighbouring hydroxyl group was found to slightly increase activation energy of the reaction but also to significantly increase
the adsorption energy.

While there is little diﬀerence in the initial structures between
the two surface models, the final states are very diﬀerent. On
the hydroxylated surface the aluminium is bonded only to one
oxygen and hence the Al–O bond is shorter (1.71 Å) than on the
gibbsite surface (1.92 and 1.81 Å) where aluminium is twice
coordinated. The larger coordination on the gibbsite surface
leads to a surprisingly small difference in the overall reaction
energy. Just as in the adsorption of the TMA, the DMA resulting
from the reaction is also more distorted on the gibbsite than on
the hydroxylated surface. C–Al–C angle is closer to the triangular
geometry on the hydroxylated surface (121.6 1)t h a no nt h e
gibbsite surface (100.8 1) where the angle deviates severely from
the planar configuration.
Considering the diﬀerence in the activation energies,
the diﬀerence in the bond lengths during the reaction is
surprisingly small. The Al–O and Al–C bonds are slightly
(0.03–0.04 Å) longer in the transition state on the gibbsite
surface. From the partial charges it can be seen that the
reaction takes place between the negative methyl group
(ca. /C0 0.8 charge on the carbon atom) and a positively charged
proton of the hydroxyl group.
The eﬀect of the surface coverage to the initial reaction
on the hydroxylated surface was also studied. Adsorption of
another TMA next to the DMA was found to lead to an increase
in the adsorption energy. The adsorption energy of the second
TMA is/C0 1.32 eV, slightly more exothermic than the for a single
TMA. The second TMA can undergo a similar ligand-exchange
reaction with the adsorbent hydroxyl group similar to the first
reaction. Higher surface coverage leads to a slight increase in
the activation energy. Activation energy for the second TMA was
0.45 eV with reaction energy of/C0 0.48 eV.
Interestingly the adsorption energy for a third TMA is even
more exothermic, /C0 1.90 eV. However, with two DMAs and one
TMA per 2 /C2 2 unit cell (which corresponds to methyl concen-
tration of 8.6 Me nm /C0 2), the high surface coverage leads to
steric interaction with the neighbouring adsorbants and raises
the activation energy for the reaction to 0.72 eV. The ligand-
exchange reaction becomes considerably less exothermic with
reaction energy of only/C0 0.15 eV with large surface coverage.
The cause of this cooperative adsorption is the formation of
methyl-bridges between the adsorbants, illustrated schemati-
cally in Fig. 5. This cooperative adsorption might be of impor-
tance during the adsorption process and may possible lead
to an island-like growth of the adsorption layer. Also, the
formation of methyl-bridges between the aluminium atoms
can have great stabilizing eﬀect when considering the structure
of the surface at the end of the TMA pulse.
3.2.2 Second dissociation. Experiments show that the
amount of adsorbed aluminium is linearly dependent on the
surface hydroxylation and that the methyl concentration of
the surface remains approximately constant after a TMA pulse,
ca. 5–6 methyl groups per nm 2. Thus, the Al : Me-ratio also
decreases at high hydroxyl concentrations and at OH-concentration
of about 15mmol m /C0 2 the ratio is 1.5. This suggests that
the surface is mainly composed of dimethylaluminium and
monomethylaluminium.4,9
Therefore it is to be expected that DMA undergoes further
ligand-exchange reactions on the surface, i.e. mechanisms (1b)
and (1c). Several possible pathways for the second reaction were
studied and the lowest reaction barrier was found for direct
reaction with a neighbouring hydroxyl group (see Fig. 6). The
activation energy for the reaction is 0.51 eV, slightly higher than
for the reaction (1a). The change in the activation energy is
relatively small considering that the proton on the neighbour-
ing hydroxyl group is expected to be less acidic than the proton
in the reaction (1a) and that the DMA has to react with a proton
several angstroms away. This requires almost linear Al–O–Al
bond to bend down to 140 1. In the final state the monomethyl-
aluminium is bonded to three oxygens of three hydroxyl groups
which makes the reaction extremely exothermic with respect to
previous reactions with reaction energy of/C0 1.38 eV. As the
MMA bonds with three hydroxyl groups, proton-transfer
between a lower hydroxyl group and a protonless higher
hydroxyl group is observed. As the ligand-exchange reactions
consume protons from the surface to produce methane, the
resulting bare oxygen sites make the surface even more basic.
The adsorption of a TMA to the bare oxygen around the MMA is
exothermic with/C0 1.65 eV which is 0.5 eV more exothermic
than adsorption onto a hydroxyl group. Addition of another
TMA next to the same MMA causes steric interaction between
the adsorbants leading to a weak adsorption bond for the
second TMA.
Adsorption to the hydroxyl group next to the MMA is also
possible. Adsorption of a TMA to the hydroxyl group that is
bonded to the MMA is exothermic with/C0 1.15 eV, same as
for an isolated hydroxyl group. The activation energy for the
ligand-exchange reaction with this hydroxyl group is however
considerably higher than for the initial reaction, over 1 eV
with reaction energy of/C0 1.11 eV, making the hydroxyl group
practically inert. Adsorption of a TMA was observed not to
considerably aﬀect the energetics of the MMAs reaction with a
hydroxyl group i.e. the third dissociation.
The DMA on the gibbsite-like surface is coordinated to two
oxygens and is hence constrained to its location. Only a reac-
tion with the neighbouring hydroxyl group is possible. The
activation energy for a reaction with the closest neighbour was

calculated to be 0.72 eV which is slightly higher than in the
first reaction. This results in a stable monomethylaluminium
coordinated to three oxygens. The reaction is exothermic with
reaction energy of/C0 1.15 eV.
3.2.3 Third dissociation. The monomethylaluminium is
coordinated to three oxygens on the surface and is therefore
extremely rigid. The only plausible pathway for the MMA to
react is to receive a proton from one of the hydroxyl groups (see
Fig. 7). However, due to the rigid structure of the MMA the
activation energy for the ligand-exchange reaction becomes
high. The activation energy for the reaction is 1.05 eV with
reaction energy of/C0 0.44 eV.
As a thin film grows thicker, the structure of the film goes
through a phase transition called densification 34 where the
density of the film increases. This is not observed in the
previous mechanisms (1a) or (1b) as the structures represent
the initial stage of the ALD process. However, as the aluminium
loses its final ligand it forms a new bond with the underlying
surface oxygen. This leads to densification of the forming film,
i.e.the density of the forming thin film is increased. The
mechanism is however blocked by a high barrier and probably
does not occur at low TMA coverages but a similar reaction
might be of importance as the process progresses.
Various diﬀerent mechanisms were studied for reactions
(1b) and (1c). Some of these mechanisms involved proton
transfer from one hydroxyl group to another. The barriers for
proton diﬀusion on the surface amongst the lower and higher
hydroxyl groups can be estimated to be around 0.5–0.6 eV with
negligible reaction energies.
3.3 Reactions during water pulse
After the TMA has saturated the surface, the gas-phase is
cleansed with inert gas and a water pulse is introduced to the
system. The water reacts with the saturated surface, removes
the remaining methyl groups and hydroxylates the surface
for the following TMA pulse. Here we have studied the mechan-
isms during the water pulse using the end-products from
the TMA molecule calculations similar to other previous
studies.10,35 The final states of reactions (1a) (DMA) and (1b)
(MMA) were taken as the initial configurations for the water
pulse mechanisms.
An accurate estimation of the surface structure after the
TMA pulse is beyond the scope of the present work due to the
complex nature of the surface saturation. Extensive simulations
would be required to determine the composition of the satu-
rated surface due to the fact that the TMA has several diﬀerent
dissociation-stages. The water pulse reactions studied are sche-
matically represented by the eqn (2a)–(2c).
3.3.1 Dimethylaluminium and water. Just like the TMA,
the DMA is a Lewis-acid and is therefore an ideal adsorption
site for Lewis-basic water molecules. The ligand-exchange
mechanism between the DMA and water is straight-forward,
the water adsorbs to the DMA and donates a proton to the
methyl-ligand. The water molecule has an adsorption energy
and reaction barrier of/C0 0.64 eV and 0.44 eV, respectively. This
ligand-exchange reaction is exothermic with reaction energy of
/C00.61 eV. The reaction mechanism is depicted in Fig. 8.
The resulting monomethylaluminium hydroxide can further
react with water into a aluminium dihydroxide. An adsorption

energy for a single water molecule onto the MMA–OH is
significantly increased to/C0 1.13 eV from the previous mechanism.
Reaction barrier and energy for the mechanism is 0.67 eV,
/C00.28 eV, respectively. The mechanism for the reaction is very
similar to the first DMA + H 2O-reaction.
3.3.2 Monomethylaluminium and water. The structure of
the monomethylaluminium is very diﬀerent from the DMA. The
aluminium is ‘‘shielded’’ by the surrounding oxygens and it
was found that the closed structure made it impossible for a
single water molecule to remove the methyl-ligand from the
MMA. A shortab initio molecular dynamics simulation with
several water molecules suggested that a water molecule might
first break the MMA structure from three oxygen coordinated to
a two coordinated one. This structure could then react with
another water molecule. We have here studied the mechanism
(2c) with several water molecules and labelled them as 2c w1,
2cw2 and 2c w3 depending on the amount of water molecules
within the mechanism.
The attack by a water molecule to the MMA aluminium is
illustrated in Fig. 9. The adsorption energy of the water mole-
cule to the surface is/C0 0.64 eV which is quite small when
compared to the adsorption energies on the DMA. In the
reaction path studied (mechanism 2cw1), the water molecule
was observed to donate one of its protons to a neighbouring
hydroxyl group and bonding to the MMA as a hydroxyl group.
This proton transfer is an artifact resulting from the fact that
hydroxylated surface has only partially reacted with the TMA
pulse. The barrier for this dissociative adsorption process is
small, only 0.26 eV with exothermic reaction energy of/C0 0.62 eV.
After the reaction the MMA is no longer blocked and there is
enough space for another water molecule to attack.
When the MMAs structure is opened, an attack by a water
molecule from the opposite side is possible. This mechanism is
denoted 2cw2 since it now involves two water molecules. The
reaction was found to have a barrier of 0.63 eV and reaction
energy of/C0 1.07 eV. However, also a mechanism containing
an additional water molecule was tested. This was found to
considerably lower the reaction barrier (mechanism 2cw3),
illustrated in Fig. 10. The barrier was brought down to 0.39 eV
with increased reaction energy of /C0 1.61 eV. The adsorption
energy of a water molecule was calculated to be /C0 0.72 eV for
both mechanisms 2cw2 and 2cw3.
3.4 Free energy surface of reaction pathways
In order to investigate the results at the process conditions,
finite temperature was included in our calculations. Entropic
contributions were estimated using eqn (2)–(4). For gaseous
species translational, rotational and vibrational contributions
were considered. For surface species only vibrational contribu-
tions were included. Free energies on the pathways were
calculated in temperatures 298.15 K and 450 K with TMA–
H2O pressure of 2 Pa. Using the rate eqn (5) and (6) the reaction
rates were computed at temperatures 298.15 K and 450 K.
Gibbs free energies for the reaction pathways are presented
in Tables 4 and 5 and corresponding reaction rates are given in
Tables 6 and 7.
4 Discussion
4.1 Reaction energetics of the TMA pulse
We have studied TMA adsorption and subsequent surface
reactions on a realistic hydroxylated surface model and compared

cell corresponds to a methyl surface concentration of 4 mmol m /C0 2 .

the MMA. Barrier for this adsorption process is 0.26 eV.

our results with previously reported study on a gibbsite-like
surface model. The reaction energetics and the zero-point energy
corrected values for the TMA pulse are presented in Table 2.
Previously presented results were also replicated due to diﬀer-
ences in computational methods.
Our reaction energetics on the gibbsite-surface are similar to
previously reported results with the exception of the adsorption
energy which was estimated to be 0.6 eV more exothermic than
previously stated in the literature. This is mainly caused by the
implemented van der Waals correction that was not included
in the previous simulations. The barrier for the reaction (1a)
obtained from the cluster model by Widjaja and Musgrave10 is
quite similar when compared to the hydroxylated model con-
sidering that the hybrid functional used by Widjaja and Musgrave
usually gives somewhat higher energies for reaction barriers. We
consider however this agreement to be somewhat accidental.
Our results show that TMA adsorbs to the hydroxylated
alumina surface exothermically with adsorption energy of
/C01.13 eV. Adsorption energy on the hydroxylated surface is
0.5 eV less exothermic than on the gibbsite-like surface. Addi-
tion of another TMA was found to increase the adsorption and
activation energies slightly. This eﬀect was further increased
with the inclusion of a third TMA indicating a cooperative eﬀect
among the adsorbants. The additional TMA is able to form
methyl-bridges with the neighbouring DMAs which consider-
ably increases the adsorption energy. However, the activation
energy for the ligand-exchange reaction also increases due to
steric eﬀects as the surface becomes crowded.
A cooperative eﬀect between neighbouring adsorbants has
previously been reported during the growth of HfO 2 thin films
by Shirazi and Elliott 36 and by the same authors for the growth
of Al 2O3.14 Shirazi and Elliott found that the adsorption of H 2O
occurs only onto a low coordinated hafnium atom provided
there is a another low coordinated hafnium-precursor as its
neighbour. For the Al2O3 process Shirazi and Elliott found that
the proton transfer from surface hydroxyl groups depend
strongly on the coordination of the hydroxyl groups oxygen.
Using a gibbsite-like surface model they found that a DMA on
the surface is relatively inert. However, the methyl groups
dissociates with relatively low barrier if an additional DMA is
introduced close to the reacting hydroxyl group. When the
hydroxyl groups oxygens coordination is increased, the proton
becomes more acidic resulting in a lower barrier. This eﬀect is
less clear on the hydroxylated surface. In our calculations we
did not find the same eﬀect, as the reaction barriers were raised
due to steric interactions when adsorbants were brought to
close proximity (see Section 3.2.2).
On the surface the TMA can go through three ligand-
exchange reactions with intermediate products dimethylalumi-
nium (DMA) and monomethylaluminium (MMA). Reaction
barriers for these ligand-exchange reactions were found to be
considerably lower than previously reported. For the removal of
the first methyl-ligand on the hydroxylated surface the reaction
barrier was only 0.35 eV. As the surface reactions progress the
methyl-group removal was found to become less favourable.
For the second ligand activation energy was found to be 0.51 eV
and for the final methyl the barrier rose to 1.05 eV. All the
reactions were exothermic. For the first two ligand-exchange
reactions the reaction energies are/C0 0.70 eV and /C0 1.38 eV,
respectively. The reaction energy increases considerably as the

transition and final states lower the activation energy by 0.24 eV.

reacted MMA becomes three times coordinated with oxygen.
The MMA is however very rigid, resulting in high reaction
barrier and low reaction energy of /C0 0.44 eV. Due to the high
reaction barrier of the last reaction step, it is probable that at
the end of the TMA pulse the surface consists mainly of MMA
species.
The production of MMA consumes protons from the surface
creating bare oxygen sites to which the TMA adsorption is
stronger than on a hydroxyl group. For example, adsorption
energy to a bare oxygen next to an MMA was/C0 1.65 eV. Here the
TMA can react with the protons from the lower hydroxyl groups.
We estimate the barrier for the proton transfer between an
already reacted higher hydroxyl group and a lower hydroxyl
group to be of the order of 0.5–0.6 eV. However, preliminary
results show that barriers for the ligand-exchange between the
surface and a TMA adsorbed next to an MMA are high.
As an extreme case, adsorption of a TMA to a bare alumina
surface is extremely exothermic. This has been previously noted
by Elliott and Greer. 12 TMA dissociates readily on the bare
surface with adsorption energy of /C0 2.56 eV. It could be possible
that the adsorbed TMA dissociates on the surface if there are no
protons left on surface to react with.
The barriers of the surface reactions on the hydroxylated
surface are considerably lower than on the gibbsite-like surface
previously used in the literature. The diﬀerence in the activa-
tion energies for the first two ligand-exchange reactions are
0.36 eV and 0.27 eV. However, this diﬀerence is lowered to
0.19 eV and 0.09 eV, respectively, when the zero-point energies
are included.
One of the main diﬀerences between the hydroxylated sur-
face model and the previously studied gibbsite model is the
structure of the surface. The hydroxylated surface has hydroxyl
groups in two diﬀerent planes while the gibbsite-surface is
entirely planar. The adsorbed TMA is less hindered by the
neighbouring hydroxyl groups and can more easily reach the
transition state on hydroxylated surface. On the gibbsite-like
surface the planar structure leads to interactions with the
neighbouring hydroxyl groups and makes the TMA more rigid.
However, the resulting DMA is twice coordinated to oxygen on
the gibbsite-like surface leading to a larger reaction energy.
4.2 Reaction energetics of the water pulse
Reactions during the water pulse were studied using one to
three water molecules. The final states of DMA and MMA
obtained from the TMA pulse calculations were used as the
initial configurations for the water pulse corresponding to surface
methyl concentrations of 1.2 and 2.4 Me nm /C0 2, respectively.
Results of these reaction energetics are presented in Table 3.
The water adsorbs to the DMA with relatively low adsorption
energy of /C0 0.64 eV. When compared to the water adsorption
energies onto bare alumina, the adsorption energies onto DMA
is between the two and three monolayer coverages. The adsorp-
tion energy to the MMA–OH is significantly increased to
/C01.13 eV. The mechanisms in the reactions (2a) and (2b) are
similar and the larger adsorption energy leads to larger activa-
tion energy for the ligand-exchange reaction as the barrier
increases from 0.44 eV to 0.67 eV.
The MMA acquired from the TMA pulse calculations was
found to be inert to a direct attack by a water molecule. A
possible reaction pathway was found by sampling diﬀerent
configurations byab initio molecular dynamics involving
several water molecules. A water molecule was found to be able
to form a bond with the MMA aluminium and opening up the
MMAs closed structure. Another water molecule can then attack
the MMA and undergo a ligand-exchange reaction similar to the
one with the DMA and MMA-hydroxide in reactions (2a) and (2b).
The interactions between water molecules were found to
play an important role. A barrier for the adsorption of the water
onto the MMA was 0.26 eV. However, the adsorption happened
spontaneously during a dynamical simulation with ten or so
water molecules so water–water-interactions can lower this
barrier even further. Also, an addition of another water mole-
cule next to the attacking water molecule in reaction pathway
(2c) was able to lower the reaction barrier 0.2 eV. The impor-
tance of the dynamic nature of water during the surface
reactions in an ALD-process has previously been pointed out
by Mukhopadhyayet al.35 and Shirazi et al.14
4.3 Energetics at a finite temperature
The free energy profiles of the reaction pathways were calculated
in order to include finite temperature and pressure eﬀects. All the
calculations were done in temperatures 298.15 K and 450 K at
TMA–H2O pressure of 2 Pa. Free energies along different reaction
pathways are given in Tables 4 and 5.
The free energies of the reaction barriers are overall quite
temperature neutral showing only small deviations as a function
of temperature. However, the adsorption energies are dominated
by the translational and rotational entropies of the gaseous

reaction. The overall reaction energy DE includes the desorption of the by-product methane. Adsorption energies are for a single adsorbed molecule.

molecules due to high temperature and especially low pressure.
The entropy change in the adsorption of TMA at 298.15 K is
1.21 eV and at 450 K is 1.94 eV, which leads to positive free
energies for adsorption above room temperature. While this
entropic eﬀect makes the adsorption free energy more positive,
it also increases reaction energies as the methane desorption
produces entropy and the free energy of the reaction steps
become more negative at higher temperatures.
The overall process can be studied by comparing the reac-
tion rates and reaction rate coeﬃcients of diﬀerent mecha-
nisms. While the adsorption rates are not directly comparable
to the reaction rate coeﬃcients as the surface reactions depend
on the surface coverage, a qualitative inspection of the rates
and rate coeﬃcients give an insight to the advancement of the
surface processes. The reaction rate coeﬃcients for diﬀerent
reactions can be calculated from the Gibbs free energy using
eqn (5).
For example, the high temperature and low pressure of the
process make the adsorption the rate limiting step. Adsorption
of the TMA was found to be cooperative with the formation of
methyl bridges between adsorbants. On the surface the first
ligand-exchange reactions are considerably faster than the
adsorption rate. The adsorption rate,kads, can be approximated
as the collision flux in kinetic theory of gases (eqn (6)). We have
approximated the area of the adsorption site as a reciprocal of
the surface concentration of the top-most hydroxyl groupsi.e.
4.89 OH nm /C0 2. The sticking probability is unity at low surface
coverage. The initial adsorption rate is then kads = 4.2 /C2 103 s/C0 1
per a hydroxyl group at the process conditions (P =2P a , T =4 5 0K ) .
The adsorption rate onto the surface is several orders of
magnitude smaller than the reaction rate coeﬃcients for the
first two surface reactions: for the reactions (1a)–(1c) the rates
at 450 K are k1a = 3.6 /C2 109 s/C0 1, k1b = 4.6 /C2 108 s/C0 1 and k1c =
4.4 /C2 102 s/C0 1, respectively.
The desorption rate can be calculated from the equilibrium
constant:
kdes ¼ kads
K ¼ kadseDGads
For a single TMA the desorption rate is of the order of 5.6 /C2
109 s/C0 1 which is of the same order of magnitude as the initial
surface reaction (1a). The initial reaction step and desorption
are two competing processes and of the same magnitude at the
process conditions. The desorption rate is considerably lowered
at lower temperatures and at with the formation of methyl-
bridges between the adsorbants. The cooperative eﬀect between
the adsorbants may lead to an island like growth of the
adsorbed layer. The reaction rate coeﬃcients for the TMA-
and water-pulse reactions are presented in Tables 6 and 7.
The rate of the final ligand-exchange reaction (mechanism
(1c)) is several magnitudes slower than the first two ligand-
exchange reactions which indicates that the main product from
the TMA pulse is MMA. The production of MMA and methane
consumes protons from the surface and turns hydroxyl groups
into bare oxygen sites. These sites are very basic and can also
adsorb TMA. As pointed out earlier in the text, the reaction
barrier for the proton transfer between the lower and upper

hydroxyl groups is only ca. 0.5–0.6 eV. Additional methane can
be released when protons are transported from the lower
hydroxyl groups to the previously reacted upper group oxygens.
When all the protons on the surface have been consumed, the
possible free oxygen sites are covered with new TMA. The
formation of methyl-bridges between TMA and DMA/MMA
can help stabilize the adsorbed molecules.
Similar kinetic parameters can be estimated also for the
water pulse. The adsorption rate of water to the surface is kads =
1.2 /C2 104 s/C0 1 at the process conditions ( P = 2 Pa, T = 450 K, with
the empirical surface methyl-concentration of 5 Me nm /C0 2). The
adsorption rate is larger for the water pulse than for the TMA
pulse due to the smaller mass of the molecule. Unlike in the
TMA pulse, during the water pulse every mechanism starts with
the adsorption of another water molecule. Because of the low
adsorption energies for water, the desorption rates from the
surface are some orders of magnitude larger than the surface
reaction rates. Only for the reaction between DMA and water (2a) the
rates are of the same magnitude. Reaction rates for the calculated
pathways are presented in Table 7.
Possible interactions between the water molecules on the
surface are likely to stabilize the transition states, so the estima-
tions done using only one water molecule give an upper bound
for the reaction barriers. Overall the process is shown to be
thermodynamically stable with negative free energy and to have
reaction barriers that are accessible in the process conditions.
5 Conclusion
Density functional calculations for the initial surface reactions
of the trimethylaluminium–water ALD-process are presented
using a more realistic surface model than previously used in the
literature. Several reaction pathways were searched and calcu-
lations include finite temperature effects.
TMA is found to adsorb exothermically. The overall reactions
have very negative Gibbs free energy. The reaction barriers for the
initial ligand-exchange reactions between the upper hydroxyl
groups and the TMA were found to be small. TMA dissociation
is predicted to terminate at monomethylaluminium. After the
higher hydroxyl groups have reacted into MMA, the surface is left
with bare oxygen sites and some remaining hydroxyl sites that are
still susceptible to TMA adsorption and dissociation. This will
lead to some DMA surface species. We predict that a methyl-
bridge network is formed during the adsorption of TMA and is
used to stabilize the adsorbed aluminium atoms at the end of
the pulse.
Water pulse was studied using few water molecules. Water
molecules were found to adsorb exothermically to DMA but
adsorption to MMA has a small barrier. Reaction barriers with
the products from the TMA pulse, the DMA and the MMA, are
accessible in the process conditions. However, calculations
with few water molecules were shown to be sensitive to water–
water-interactions.
The TMA–H 2O system is one of the most studied ALD-
processes, mainly experimentally. The surface processes are
complex and difficult to measure but with computational
research it is possible to obtain insight on the possible surface
mechanisms and energetics. Understanding the surface pro-
cesses and kinetics is essential in the design and optimization
of ALD processes.
