Abstract
Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) is used in the semiconductor industry for the analysis and design of chemical
vapor deposition reactors. One critical input needed for prediction of epitaxial thin ﬁlm growth rates and uniformity is
the chemistry occurring in the gas phase and at the surface. Traditionally, simpliﬁed chemistry derived from
experimental observations has been used for this purpose. With the advent of modern high-speed computational
techniques,itisnowpossibletoformulatedetailedreactionmechanismsusingabinitiomethods.Suchdetailedreaction
mechanisms, comprising mostly of elementary reactions, have the advantage that they require little or no calibration.
This paper presents a methodology in which the density functional theory, in combination with rate theories, was used
to determine the reaction pathways and rates in the gas phase as well as at the surface for gallium nitride growth from
tri-methyl gallium and ammonia. The reaction mechanisms were then used as input to a multi-dimensional CFD code
enabling accurate prediction of growth rates. Validation studies were performed for four different laboratory-scale
reactors, and one commercial reactor. In each case, the predictions agreed reasonably well with the experimental data
indicating the universality of the reaction mechanisms.

1. Introduction
Wide band-gap III–V semiconductors, such as
gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminum gallium
nitride (AlGaN), have drawn much attention due
to their unique ability to produce blue-green light
[1]. This property is currently being used to
develop light emitting diodes (LED) and lasers.
In order to make such devices, a thin ﬁlm of the
materials must be deposited on a wafer. At
present, the technique of choice for depositing
thin ﬁlms of III–V semiconductor materials is
metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE).
Modeling and simulation, based on computa-
tionalﬂuiddynamics(CFD),isnowusedroutinely
within the semiconductor industry for design,
optimization and troubleshooting of epitaxial
growth processes that occur on the substrate.
The efﬁcacy of such modeling is currently limited
by the availability of chemical reaction mechan-
isms that describe the growth process. In the past,
reaction rates have been obtained primarily by
calibrating a reduced set of reactions against
available experimental data, which in most cases,
is somewhat limited. With the advent of high-
speed computers it is now possible to explore
larger reaction sets comprising of mostly elemen-
tary reactions using ﬁrst-principle methods, such
as density function theory (DFT). Such detailed
reaction mechanisms can provide more generality
and requires less calibration.
In the speciﬁc case of GaN, a handful of past
studies have reported reaction mechanisms[2,3].
All of these mechanisms are based on the one
proposed originally by Mihopoulos [4]. In their
study, the activation barriers of some of the gas-
phasereactionstepswerecalculatedusingabinitio
methods. Pre-exponential factors of the formation
and dissociation of adducts were adjusted to
reproduce the time versus concentration proﬁles
obtained through experiments. While the ab initio
methods were used to determine the activation
energies of some of the gas-phase reactions, most
of the surface reactions were considered to be
collision-limited, and the activation barriers were
calibrated.The salientfeatureof thismechanismis
theformation of a‘‘ring’’ compound (ora trimeric
species)withmolecularformula[Ga(CH3)2/C1NH2]3
through the gas phase reaction between trimethyl
gallium (TMG) and ammonia (NH3) according to
the following reaction:
TMGþ NH3 ! TMG/C1NH3
! GaðCH3Þ2 /C1NH2 þ CH4;
3GaðCH3Þ2 /C1NH2 !½ GaðCH3Þ2 /C1NH2/C1383:
This compound reacts at the surface and
constitutes the major pathway for GaN growth
[4]. Although there is no direct evidence of such a
proposition, this mechanism has been frequently
used by others for GaN growth modeling and
reactor design[2,3,5].
In a recent paper[6], it has been shown that the
possibility of ‘‘ring’’ compound formation is
extremely low under typical growth conditions
due to very low concentration of Ga(CH3)2/C1NH2.
These results are further supported by a recent
experimental report of Bergman et al.[7], who
pointed out that the contribution of growth due to
the trimeric species has been overestimated in the
past. Based on these experimental and theoretical
ﬁndings, a new mechanism for GaN growth is
proposed that does not support the formation of
the ‘‘ring’’ compound in the gas phase. The
proposed mechanism is based on ﬁrst-principle
calculations in combination with reaction rate
theories, such as absolute rate theory (ART) and
quantum Rice–Rapmsperger–Kassel (QRRK)[8].
The present mechanism is tested for several
different reactors, and is able to reproduce
experimental data consistently.
2. Calculation procedure
In order to obtain activation barrier and
vibrational frequencies of the stable and inter-
mediate molecules, we used density functional
theory (DFT). All quantum chemistry calculations
were performed using GAUSSIAN98TM [9] pro-
gram package. For the calculation of the activa-
tion barrier, the DFT with Lee–Yang–Parr
gradient corrected correlation functional in
conjunction with Becke’s three-parameter ex-
change functional (B3LYP) was used[10,11]. The

geometries of the equilibrium molecular structures
and transition states were optimized using
6–31G**basissetsforcarbon,hydrogen,nitrogen.
Forgallium,effectivecorepotential(ECP)ofHay-
Wadt, which is known as LANL2DZ ECP[12],
was used. In order to obtain more accurate
energies, calculations using cc-pVTZ[13] basis
set on previously optimized geometries were
performed. Normal mode analyses for all equili-
brium and transition structures were performed.
All equilibrium structures were found to have real
vibrational frequencies while the transition struc-
tures have only one imaginary vibrational fre-
quency corresponding to the reaction coordinate.
2.1. Gas phase reactions
The gas phase reactions primarily involve the
decomposition of TMG to dimethyl gallium
(DMG) and monomethyl gallium (MMG) and
their reactions with NH3:
GaðCH3Þx ! GaðCH3Þx/C01 þ CH3 ðx ¼ 123Þ;
GaðCH3Þyþ1 þ NH3 ! GaðCH3Þyþ1 /C1NH3 ðadductÞ
!ð CH3Þy:GaNH2 þ CH4 ðy ¼ 0/C02Þ:
Details, pertaining to the gas-phase reactions
and their calculation methods may be obtained
from the recent paper by Sengupta[6]. The
activation barrier and vibrational frequencies for
the decomposition of TMG and its intermediate
products have been calculated using DFT method.
These are subsequently used to calculate the rate
constants as a function of temperature and
pressure using QRRK theory. These reactions
are pressure dependent, and the rate constants
havebeenevaluatedatatypicalreactorpressurein
which GaN is grown (approximately 76torr). In
Fig. 1, the calculated rate constants for TMG
decomposition have been compared with the
experimental data of Jacko and Price[14],a n d
shows excellent agreement. Our calculations show
that TMG, DMG and MMG form strong adducts
with NH3. The adducts subsequently eliminate
CH4. The adduct formation reaction and elimina-
tion of CH4 are not two independent reactions
since the energy released by the formation of
adducts is stored in quantized vibrational level of
the adducts, and can be utilized to cross the
activation barrier for CH4 elimination reaction.
Therefore, these reactions have been treated via
chemical activation1[15,16] and the rate constants
have been calculated using QRRK theory. In the
earlier mechanism by Mihopoulos[4] these reac-
tionshavebeenassumedtobeindependenttoeach
other. These reactions are also pressure dependent
because the adduct is initially at the energized
state, and molecular collisions are needed to
deactivate them. Following calculation of the
gas-phase reaction rate constants, they were ﬁtted
to the modiﬁed Arrhenius expression [i.e.
k(T) ¼ ATn exp(/C0Ea/RT)]. The ﬁtted rate con-
stants for these reactions are shown inTable 1.
2.2. Surface reactions
Since the bulk is a continuous repetition of the
unitcell,themostappropriatemethodwouldbeto
apply DFT with periodic boundary conditions
[17]. However, considering the large number of
surface reactions that one needs to examine,
calculation with periodic boundary condition is
still not practical. A popular simplifying alter-
native is to use the so-called cluster model, where
only a small cluster of atoms on the surface is
modeled[18–20]. These cluster models have been
successfully used by others [18–20] to model
surface reactions for silicon nitride, and atomic

hafnium oxides.
In bulk GaN, every Ga and N are tetrahedrally
coordinated. However, each surface atom has at
leastonedanglingbond,andthesurfaceatomscan
accommodate adsorbates. In the present calcula-
tions, the reduced cluster model shown inFig. 2
has been used for surface gallium and nitrogen
atoms. The surface gallium atom is bonded to[3]
nitrogen atoms, and the nitrogen atoms are
terminated by three hydrogen atoms. Similarly,
surface nitrogen is bonded to[3] gallium atoms,
and they are terminated by three hydrogen atoms.
The structures of the chemisorbed species were
optimized using the method described in the
previous section. The geometries of the clusters
were ﬁxed at their bulk values, and no geometry
optimization was performed for the bare cluster.
For adsorbed structures, the geometry of the
adsorbate and the bond connecting the cluster
andtheadsorbatewereoptimized. Forexample,in

the small cluster models (Fig. 2, top) are actually
N (surface N) or Ga (surface Ga). Since termina-
tion of Ga or N by hydrogen atoms can lead to

enhanced charge transfer, the calculated adsorp-
tion energies may be inaccurate. In order to
examine the reliability of our cluster model, we
performed test calculations using a larger cluster
model for surface Ga (Fig. 2, bottom). In this
model, the hydrogen atoms in NH3 were replaced
by Ga, and the terminal Ga atoms are tetrahed-
rally coordinated to two nitrogen atoms and two
hydrogen atoms. Since such calculations require
extreme computational times, the test was per-
formed only for adsorption energy calculation for
the NH2 radical. First, all geometrical parameters
in NH 2 were optimized keeping the cluster
parameters ﬁxed. The adsorption energy of NH2,
thus obtained, was found to be 50kcal/mol, which
is approximately 12kcal/mol smaller than that
obtained using the reduced cluster model. We then
performed another calculation where bond lengths
around the surface Ga in the adsorbed state were
optimized. This essentially means that the surface
of GaN reconstruct upon adsorption of NH2,
which is a more realistic phenomenon. The
adsorption energy, thus obtained, was found to
be only 2.5kcal/mol lower than that with the
reduced cluster model. The ﬁndings of these
investigations point to the fact the error intro-
duced by using a reduced cluster model is small,
and that reduced cluster models may still be used
to make reasonable engineering predictions.
The adsorption enthalpy on N surface, was
calculated by
DHad ¼ EðN_surÞþ EðadsorbateÞ
/C0EðadsorbedÞþ thermalcorrection; ð1Þ
where DHad is the enthalpy of adsorption,
E(N_sur), E(adsorbate) and E(adsorbed) are the
energies of the surface nitrogen (cluster model),
gas phase adsorbate and the adsorbed molecule.
The thermal correction is a term that accounts
for the temperature dependence of the enthalpy
of adsorption, and calculated using the complete
partition functions of the adsorbate before
and after adsorption. The pre-exponential factor
for a surface reaction is calculated using the
expression[21]:
AF ¼ð ekbT=hÞcts expðDS#=RÞ, (2)
where cts is maximum concentration of the
transition state when the surface is bare. Using
the DFT calculated vibrational, rotational, trans-
lational and electronic partition functions of the
adsorbed species and transition state for deso-
rption, the entropy of activation for desorption is
calculated. The entropy of the adsorbed species
and transition state is calculated using the follow-
ing expression:
S ¼ R ln Q þ RT qQ
q ln T
/C18/C19

, (3)
where Q is the complete partition function.
Finally, the pre-exponential factors are ﬁtted to
the expressionATn.
2.3. Reactor scale model
The prediction of growth rate and uniformity at
the surface requires coupled solution of the
equations of conservation of mass, momentum,
energy and species. In addition, multi-step ﬁnite-
rate homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical
reactions must be considered. The underlying
equations necessary to perform such calculations
and their numerical solution is presented else-
where [3,5,22], and is omitted here for the sake of
brevity. For the purposes of the current study,
the commercial CFD code, CFD-ACE+TM was
used [23].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Mechanism for GaN growth
While TMG and MMG decompose slowly (G1
and G2 inTable 1) due to their large activation
barriers, decomposition of DMG to MMG (G3) is
very fast. Therefore, TMG to MMG conversion is
fast at high temperatures, and concentration of
MMG is expected to be large at higher tempera-
tures. Thus, MMG and MMG.NH3 are expected
to be the dominant gallium-containing precursor
at high temperatures, while TMG and TMG.NH3
are expected to contribute to the deposition at low
temperature. Also at higher temperature, the
formation of atomic Ga is expected to be

appreciable, and will probably inﬂuence the
deposition process. The dissociation energy of an
N–H bond is NH3 is 108kcal/mol [24]. Thus, it
may be postulated that direct dissociation of NH3
isnotimportantevenattemperaturesmuchhigher
than conventional growth temperatures. However,
CH3 canabstractonehydrogenatomfromNH 3 to
produce NH2 with a low barrier (G11). Therefore,
thisreactionisincluded,inviewofthefactthatGa
and NH2 could combine to contribute to the
deposition. Reactions G12 is active when H2 is the
carrier gas, and produces active H atoms. The H
atoms can enhance decomposition of TMG and
DMG. Rate constants of G12, G13 and G14 were
taken from literature[25].
As mentioned earlier, the proposed gas phase
mechanism does not include ‘‘ring’’ formation,
since it has been found recently that the concen-
tration of Ga(CH3)2NH2, the precursor to ‘‘ring’’
formation, is negligible under typical growth
conditions[6]. The mass spectrometric studies of
Bergmanetal. [7]suggestthattheconcentrationof
the ‘‘ring’’ is negligible at all temperatures.
Mazzarese et al.[26] performed FTIR and surface
analysis for the TMG and NH3 reaction below
573K. They concluded that the ﬁnal step for
growth of GaN is the reaction between Ga(CH3)x
(x ¼ 1–3) and NH3 at the surface which produces
CH4. This work indicates that the methane
eliminated product from Ga(CH3)x.NH3 can be
formed at the surface rather than in the gas phase.
These results suggest that the ‘‘ring’’ formation is
more likely to occur at the surface via successive
addition of Ga(CH3)x and NH3 followed by
methane elimination. Therefore, the proposed
surface mechanism includes ‘‘ring’’ formation at
the surface.
The surface reactions that areconsidered for the
studyarelistedin Table2.Theﬁrstpathwayisone
where the chemisorption of MMG on surface
nitrogen site (SN) and its desorption are consid-
ered. Ammoniathen formsa complex with MMG,
namely MMG/C1NH3(s) (analogous to that in the
gas phase adduct, MMG /C1NH3). The direct
adsorption of gas phase MMG /C1NH3 is also
considered. The binding energy of the complex is
assumed to be same as that of the gas phase
counterpart. The MMG/C1NH3(s) then successively
reacts with gas phase MMG and NH3 eliminating
CH4 to form a ‘‘ring’’ at the surface as shown
in Fig. 3. The activation barrier for CH4 elimina-
tion was estimated as follows. First, it was
assumed that the ratio of the activation barrier
for TMG/C1NH3+TMG-TMG/C1NH2/C1DMG+
CH4 and TMG/C1NH3-(CH3)2GaNH2+CH4 is
the same that of MMG/C1NH3+MMG-MMG/C1
NH2Ga+CH4 and MMG/C1NH3-GaNH2+CH4.
The ratio of the former two reactions was
estimated from DFT calculations of Nakamura
et al. [27] while the activation barrier for the
MMG/C1NH3+MMG-MMG/C1NH2Ga+CH4 was
evaluated using the methods described an earlier
section. The ring is then attached to a nearby
surface Ga (SG). Finally, the hydrogen atoms
are eliminated as H2 resulting in the formation of
GaN(b).
The second path for GaN formation initiates
from adsorbed GaNH2 [GaNH2(s)]. This species
can directly be formed from the gas phase reaction
G15 and also via the reaction of adsorbed Ga
[Ga(s)] and adsorbed NH2 [NH2(s)]. Successive
adsorption of MMG and NH3 and elimination of
CH4 produce a ‘‘ring’’ (Fig. 3). The adsorption of
two CH3 radicals at each Ga atom of the ring
followed by elimination of CH4 produces GaN.
The activation barriers for successive adsorption
ofMMGandNH3 wereassumedtobethesameas
their adduct formation energy in the gas phase
while the adsorption of CH3 was calculated using
the cluster model. Activation barrier for CH 4
elimination step was calculated using DFT. To
calculate this barrier, a ring structure of formula
[Ga(CH3)2NH2]3, was considered . The activation
barrier for the CH4 elimination from the ring was
found to be substantially higher than the similar
reaction between TMG and NH3. This is probably
due to the constrained structure of the above ring
compared to the TMG.NH3 complex.
In the third pathway, TMG adsorbs on SN to
form TMG(s). Ammonia is then adsorbed on
TMG to form TMG /C1NH3(s). The adsorption
energy is assumed to be the same as the adduct
formation energy in the gas phase. This complex
ﬁrst eliminates one molecule of CH4 and conse-
quently the N atom forms a strong bond with the
Ga atom. The activation barrier of this step is

assumed to be the same as that of its gas phase
counterpart. Finally, the complex eliminates two
molecules of CH4 toproduceGaN(b)( Fig. 3).The
activation barrier of this ﬁnal step was assumed to
be the same as the CH4 elimination barrier from
thering(50kcal/mol).Wehavealsoconsideredthe
direct adsorption of TMG.NH3 adduct. Fig. 4
schematically shows the various pathways leading
to GaN deposition.
3.2. Validation studies
The proposed mechanisms for GaN growth
were used in a series of simulations of several
different reactors. The same set of reaction rates
(without any calibration, whatsoever) were used in
all of the simulations.
The ﬁrst set of simulations was performed for a
simple horizontal reactor, for which experimental
data are available from Chen et al.[28]. The
reactor geometry, and boundary conditions are
shown inFig. 5. The average deposition rate is
shown for the temperature range 700–1300K in
Fig. 6. It is clear that the predicted growth rates
agree well with experimental data. Between 700
and 850K, the growth rate varies drastically. This
is the rate-limited regime where diffusion of
precursors to the surface dominates over the rate
at which they react. The activation barriers for
most reactions are not crossed, and the reaction
rates are low, leading to low deposition rates. At
about 850K, the TMG/C1NH3(s) complex starts
eliminating CH4, since sufﬁcient energy is avail-
able to cross the activation barrier for CH 4
elimination. The formation of MMG in the gas
phase steadily increases as the temperature is
increased further. This results in deposition
through both MMG pathways as well as through
the TMG pathway. Beyond about 1100K, there is
hardly any TMG available at the surface, and
almost all of the deposition occurs via the two
MMG pathways. At temperatures above 1350K,
MMG(s) starts desorbing from the surface, lead-
ing to decrease in growth.
Thesecondsetofsimulationswasperformedfor
the reactor geometry reported by Safvi et al.[5].
Thereactorgeometryandoperatingconditionsare
illustrated inFig. 7. The growth rate proﬁles at
two different operating conditions are shown in
Figs. 8 and 9. For the higher TMG ﬂow case, the
match is not very good near the center of the
wafer, where the TMG jet directly impinges. This
may be attributed to our lack of knowledge of the
geometric details pertaining to both the position
and shape of the TMG nozzle, and due to the fact
that we did not model the actual showerhead. For

the lower ﬂow-rate case, where diffusion domi-
nates the transport, the exact placement of the
nozzle is insigniﬁcant, and a much better agree-
ment with experimental data is observed.
The third set of simulations was performed for
the reactor geometry reported by Theodoropoulos
et al.[3]. The reactor geometry and operating
conditions are illustrated inFig. 10. The average
growth rates at various temperatures are shown in
Fig. 11. Although this data is only for the
diffusion-limited regime, the excellent match be-
tween predicted and experimental results does
highlight the universality of the proposed mechan-
ism. It is worth noting that Theodoropoulos et al.

[3] also performed modeling studies for the same
data, and underpredicted the experimental data
consistently using a reduced mechanism.
One critical issue for MOVPE of an III–V
material is the effect of V–III ratio on growth rate.
While it has been generally observed that GaN
growth rate increases with increasing V–III ratio
(more ammonia), there are instances, where a
reverse trend has been reported. Notably, Niebuhr
et al.[29] reported that during their experimental
studies, they found that the growth rate actually
decreased with increasing V–III ratio. A schematic

of the reactor used for their studies is shown in
Fig. 12. When simulations were performed for this
reactor geometry with various V–III ratio, it was
indeed observed that the growth rate decreased
with increasing V–III ratio (Fig. 13). A plausible
explanation for this type of behavior is that as the
V–III ratio is increased, the ammonia concentra-
tion near the substrate increases and the hydrogen
concentration decreases. Since ammonia is much
heavier than hydrogen, the diffusion of TMG in
ammonia is much weaker than the diffusion of
TMG in hydrogen. Consequently, although more
ammonia is available to react at the surface, very
little TMG actually diffuses in through the
ammonia stream to the substrate. As the V–III
ratio is decreased, hydrogen replaces ammonia,

and the diffusion of TMG becomes more pro-
nounced leading to higher growth rates. This
continues until the V–III ratio is so low that not
enough ammonia is available at the surface.
Beyond this point, the growth rate decreases
again. In contrast, such behavior does not occur
in stagnation-ﬂow type reactors, such as the one
employed by Safvi et al.[5], and the growth rate
increases with increasing V–III ratio. This is
shown inFig. 14.
Finally, we test our mechanism versus measured
values from the paper by Thrush et al.[30] for a
Thomas Swan Scientiﬁc Ltd reactor. The axi-
symmetric modelgeometryusedforthesimulation
is shown inFig. 15. It should be noted that the
exact geometry of this reactor is proprietary and
our geometry is based on the visual inspection of
the published reactor’s picture. The ratio of TMG
and NH3 was kept at a constant V/III mole ratio
of2200.The ﬂowrateofthecarrier gas, hydrogen,
was adjusted accordingly to maintain a total ﬂow
rate of 20slm, as set by the experiment. The
pressure of the reactor is 100Torr. The wafer
rotates and is assumed to have a uniform
temperature of 1303K. The outside walls of the
reactor are water-cooled and are assumed to be
333K. The boundary conditions corresponding to
the showerhead was modeled as multiple inlets to
increase the penetration of the inlet ﬂow.Fig. 16
shows that the simulated deposition rate in
excellent agreement with the experiment as a
function of NH3 ﬂow.
4. Summary and conclusions
The effectiveness of combining ab initio quan-
tum chemistry calculations with CFD in the
modeling of growth of GaN has been demon-
strated. Reaction pathways have been calculated
using the ﬁrst-principles quantum chemistry tech-
niques. The activation barriers and the vibrational
frequencies have been used to calculate rate
constants using QRRK and transition state
theory. The rate constant for the surface reactions
have been calculated using transition state theory
after taking into account the various degrees of
freedom of the molecules in the gas phase,
adsorbed state and transition state. The new
mechanism has been used to calculate deposition
rate for ﬁve different reactors using CFD. CFD

calculation using the proposed mechanism is able
to reproduce the correct temperature dependence
of the growth rate for both laboratory-scale and
commercial reactors. Also, the present mechanism
is able to reproduce two opposing trend of growth
rate as a function of V–III ratio. All of these
observations lead to the conclusion that the
proposed mechanism for GaN growth is fairly
universal and accounts for most of the important
pathways leading to epitaxial growth of GaN.
