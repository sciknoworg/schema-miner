Abstract
The principles of the atomic layer deposition (ALD ) method are presented emphasizing the importance of precursor and surface
chemistry . With a proper adjustment of the experimental conditions, i.e. temperatures and pulsing times, the growth proceeds via
saturative steps. Selected recent ALD processes developed for films used in microelectronics are described as examples. These
include deposition of oxide films for dielectrics, and nitride and metal films for metallizations. The use of a plasma source to
form radicals is expanding the selection of ALD films to metals. Plasma-enhanced ALD also facilitates the deposition of nitride
films at low temperatures./H170502002 Elsevier Science B.V . All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The ALD method relies on alternate pulsing of the
precursor gases and vapors onto the substrate surface
and subsequent chemisorption or surface reaction of the
precursorsw1 x. The reactor is purged with an inert gas
between the precursor pulses. With a proper adjustment
of the experimental conditions the process proceeds via
saturative steps. Under such conditions the growth is
stable and the thickness increase is constant in each
deposition cycle. The self-limiting growth mechanism
facilitates the growth of conformal thin films with
accurate thickness on large areasw2 x. The growth of
different multilayer structures is also straightforward w3 x.
These advantages make the ALD method attractive for
microelectronics for manufacturing of future generation
integrated circuitsw4 x.
ALD was originally developed for fabrication of
polycrystalline luminescent ZnS:Mn and amorphous
Al O insulator films for electroluminescent flat panel23
displays, and the method itself was termed atomic layer
epitaxy(ALE ) w5 x. The early ALE literature dealt with
polycrystalline II–VI compounds and amorphous oxide
filmsw6 x. Since 1985, epitaxial growth of III–V and

II–VI compounds gained much interest w7–9 x, but no
real breakthrough was achieved in this area due to the
complicated surface chemistry . Since the mid 1990s,
rapidly increasing interest towards ALD has originated
from the silicon based microelectronics. This increase is
a consequence of the ever decreasing device dimensions
and increasing aspect ratios in integrated circuits(IC ).
In addition, the required thickness of the films has, in
many cases, decreased to the order of a few nanometers
and therefore the main drawback of ALD, the low
deposition rate, is becoming less important. The proc-
essing temperatures should also be kept low (preferably
-400 8C ). These requirements further increase the
attraction of the ALD method in the IC industry w10 x.
ALD has recently been described in several reviews
focusing on different areas; catalysts w11 x, nanotechnol-
ogy w12 x, and electronic and optoelectronic materials
w13,14 x. In this review the principles of the ALD method
are presented emphasizing the importance of precursor
and surface chemistry . Based on recent literature, select-
ed ALD processes developed for films used in microe-
lectronics are described as examples and they include
deposition of oxide films for dielectrics, and nitride
diffusion barriers and metals for metallizations. Plasma-
enhanced ALD has recently been introduced to materials
applied in silicon based microelectronics and the first
papers are reviewed here.

2. Precursor chemistry
Precursor chemistry plays a key role in ALD. The
precursors must of course be volatile and thermally
stable but they may be gases, liquids or solids. Precur-
sors must chemisorb on the surface or react rapidly with
the surface groups and react aggressively with each
other. In that way , it is possible to reach the saturation
stage in a short time(less than 1 s ) and thereby ensure
a reasonable deposition rate. The aggressive reaction
requirement is contrary to traditional CVD precursors.
The desired ALD reactions should have a large negative
DG value, but unfortunately thermodynamic data are
available only for a limited number of precursors. It
seems that in ALD, not only the properties of a single
precursor molecule are important, but the combination
of the precursors also matters.
The number of precursors and reactions used in ALD
is high as can be seen from the recent reviews made by
the authorsw15,16 x. The two cases: non-metal precur-
sors; and metal precursors are very different and show
different features. The non-metal precursors are usually
hydrides(H O, H S, NH and AsH ) without problems22 3 3
in volatility and thermal stability . Reactivity at reasona-
ble temperatures (-500 8C ) and formation of suitable
surface species for the metal precursor to be anchored,
are properties of H O and H S as shown in many ALD22
papers, but NH and AsH are examples of precursors33
with more limited reactivity . In the deposition of oxide
films, the importance of surface –OH groups has been
reported several timesw17,18 x.
Metal halides, especially chlorides, have been widely
applied in ALD for deposition of oxide, sulfide and
nitride filmsw16 x. Most of the halides are solids, but in
ALD the solid precursors are not a problem because it
is just crucial that the precursor dose is large enough to
saturate the surface, but the flux must not necessarily
be constant or homogeneous. The other important group
of compounds is metal alkyls. In many cases(Al, Zn ),
the alkyl compounds behave almost ideally in making
oxide and sulfide films, but in some cases(Ga, In ) the
results have not been very promising due to the complex
and unfavorable surface chemistry . Metal alkoxides form
the third important group of precursors and they have
been successfully employed in several oxide processes
w16 x. Electropositive metals (alkaline earth metals, rare
earth metals ) form a challenge for chemical thin film
depositions because they do not have many volatile
compoundsw19 x. b-Diketonates are the most studied
compounds of these metals and good results have been
obtained in growth of alkaline earth sulfide films w20 x,
but the growth of oxide films using water as oxygen
source does not work.b-Diketonates can be used as
precursors in deposition of, for example, rare earth oxide
but then ozone has been employed as an oxygen source
w21,22 x. The resulting films have been polycrystalline
and contained only small amounts of carbon. Recently ,
cyclopentadienyl compounds were introduced as ALD
precursors and they have been used in deposition of
both alkaline earth titanate and sulfide filmsw23,24 x.
The commercial availability of new metalorganic pre-
cursors is often limited. The scale-up of precursor
syntheses and the development of new precursors are
challenges for the further progress of ALD in industrial
scale.
During the last 2 years, a few new precursors have
been introduced to ALD and reaction mechanistic stud-
ies have been carried out for several older precursors.
Although halides have been known for a long time as
good ALD precursors, not much attention has earlier
been given to fluorides, bromides and iodides. Recently ,
fluorides and iodides have gained more attention, but
also new chloride precursors have been taken into use.
BCl is a new precursor, which has been introduced3
very recently . BCl reacts with ammonia and forms BN3
film in ALD fashion w25 x. Shimogaki et al. w26 x reported
about the first chloride adduct precursor in their flow
modulation CVD process. They used tantalum chloride
thioether adduct and ammonia in deposition of TaN
films. The important benefit of this adduct is that, unlike
TaCl itself, it is a liquid. T ungsten hexafluoride has5
been examined as a precursor for tungsten metal and
tungsten nitride films. With smart chemistry WF can 6
be transformed to W with disilane w27 x. The particular
features of the WF –Si H process are: it involves an62 6
exchange reaction during both reaction steps; the growth
rate is high, 2.5 Aycycle; and the process window is˚
wide, 150–330 8C. The films were, however, amorphous
and rather resistive. WF is also a suitable precursor in6
combination with ammonia for nitride films w28,29 x.
The stoichiometry of the films may vary but the for-
mation of polycrystalline W N has been reported. V ol-2
atile, in situ prepared tungsten oxofluorides are
precursors for tungsten oxide, WOw30 x. Polycrystalline3
films can be grown even at 200 8C. WF could not be6
used as a precursor for oxide films because of etching
effects.
The use of iodides as metal precursor has been studied
in deposition of titanium nitride w31 x, and oxides of
titanium w32,33 x, zirconium w34,35 x and tantalum w36 x.
The oxide formation reaction is enhanced if H O is 22
used instead of water. The reaction is self-limiting at
lower temperatures, but at higher temperatures metal
iodides slightly decompose. Reaction mechanism studies
show that in the case of TiO , the situation is compli-2
cated because of the structural change (anatase-rutile )
of the oxide, which changes the growth mechanism w33 x.
The TiI –H O process has even facilitated epitaxial42 2
growth at low temperature (-400 8C ) on single crystal
sapphire and MgO substrates w37 x. The oxide films
grown from the iodides are iodine-free and the properties
equal to the films deposited with chloride-water ALD

processes. In the TaI –H O process, etching takes place52 2
above 350 8C, which is 50 8C higher than in the TaCl – 5
H O process w36 x.2
A new ALD precursor, triphenyl compound, has been
introduced for bismuth w38 x. Bismuth oxide cannot be
grown from triphenyl bismuth and H O , but a ternary 22
Bi–Ti–O could be deposited. In the as-deposited films,
bismuth may partially be metallic, and the ternary oxide
phase is formed only upon annealing in air at 5008C.
Further annealing at 700 8C resulted in a crystalline
dielectric Bi Ti O phase, but it was not possible to22 7
obtain bismuth titanates with higher bismuth content. A
few new alkoxide precursors have been studied for the
deposition of zirconium oxide films, namely tetra-tert-
butoxide w39 x, tetrakis-dimethylaminoethoxide
(DMAE ), and mixed ligand complexes of DMAE with
isopropoxide and tert-butoxide w40 x. Characteristic for
all these precursors is that they already decompose
significantly at 2408C. Interestingly , especially with
aminoethoxides, the decomposition appears to be water
assisted. However, uniform films could be grown. V ana-
dium oxide is a new ALD material grown for electro-
chemical battery purposew41 x. The precursors were
vanadyl tri-isopropoxide wVO (OP r ) x and water. Thei
3
process was self-limiting up to 180 8C above which the
self-decomposition started to play a role.
No effective ALD processes have been found so far
for silicon dioxide. In all reports long pulse times have
been required to saturate the reactions. An interesting
report was recently given by Gordon et al.w42 x where
they present the deposition of SiO from N,N9-di- tert-2
butyl-1,3-diaza-2-silacyclopent-4-en-2-ylidene and oxy-
gen at 200 8C. They flash evaporated the precursor
solution and a deposition rate of 0.05 nm ycycle was
obtained throughout the length (30 cm ) of the deposition
zone.
Metal alkyl amides have been extensively studied as
CVD precursors for nitride thin films. Recently they
have also been introduced to ALD w43 x. T etrak-
is (dimethylamido )titanium (or tetrakis (ethylmethyl-
amido )titanium )-ammonia processes have shown to be
self-limiting at 170–210 8C when high ammonia doses
and long exposure times were employed. The deposition
rate was high—twice to that of the monolayer growth
in thew111 x direction of TiN. When silane is added to
the process, Ti–Si–N films can be grown and the
composition can be varied up to a Si content of 23 at.%
by controlling the number of silane pulsesw44 x. Silane
blocks the growth and accordingly the growth rate
decreases along the increasing silicon content of the
films. Ti–Si–N films showed excellent conformality
and barrier properties against Cu diffusion, but are
apparently resistivew43 x. Tantalum nitride film has been
deposited from tert-butylimidotris (diethylamido )-
tantalum. Hydrogen radicals were used to reduce this
single source precursorw45 x. The films were Ta rich in
composition and contained approximately 15 at.% of
carbon impurity . A new aluminum precursor, dimeth-
yl(aluminum hydride )-ethylenepiperidine has been
employed in ALD deposition of AlN films. In that study ,
the interfaces in TiN yAlN multilayers were of interest
w46 x. Also, a great variety of oxides can potentially be
deposited from the alkyl amides w42 x.
Recent ALD literature contains a few reports on new
processes where b-diketonates have been employed in
deposition of oxide films. Mg (thd )( thd s2,2,6,6-tetra-2
methyl-3,5-heptanedione ) can be combined with hydro-
gen peroxide, and MgO film is formed at 325–425 8C
with a growth rate of 0.10–0.14 A ycycle w47 x. Indium˚
acetylacetonate serves as a precursor in the ALD growth
of indium sulfide In S . An amorphous film was depos-23
ited at 160 8C with a growth rate of 0.8 A ycycle and it˚
was aimed for CuInSe solar cells as a buffer layer w48 x.2
In ALD oxide processes, water has most often been
the oxygen source. As mentioned above, ozone has been
used when a highly reactive oxidizing agent is needed
w21,22 x. Ozone is also an applicable precursor to be
combined with trimethyl aluminum in deposition of
Al O . The authors claim that excellent electrical prop-23
erties can be achieved with this OH-free process w49 x.
However, especially for gate oxide applications, the
strongly oxidizing character of O is of major concern 3
as it easily creates too thick SiO interfacial layers. A 2
few recent reports exist where molecular oxygen has
been used as the oxygen precursor. TiO has been grown2
from titanium iodide and oxygen at 200–350 8C w50 x,
and ZrO from tert-butoxide and oxygen at 300–400 8C2
w51 x. It seems that the metal precursor should be slightly
thermally unstable and then oxygen is reactive enough
for the oxide formation reaction at these relatively low
temperatures. Schuisky et al. w50 x were able also with
the TiI qO process to deposit epitaxial rutile on42
sapphire (012 ) and anatase on MgO (001 ) surfaces. The
use of oxygen plasma is a new trend in ALD deposition
of oxide films.
Water or hydrogen peroxide are not always desired
oxygen sources because they may be too oxidative or
reactive and therefore, a water-free process based on
alkoxides has been developed w4 x. The metal alkoxide
serves as both metal and oxygen source while the other
metal compound, typically a metal chloride, acts as the
other metal source:
Ž.bM O R qaM9X ™MM 9 O qabRXa ba b a b
Depending on whether M and M9 are similar or
different, binary or mixed oxides are obtained. The
major benefit of not using separate oxygen precursors
is the less susceptible oxidation of the substrate surfaces.
This is very important when thin oxide layers are to be
deposited directly on silicon without creating an inter-
facial silicon oxide layer.

In deposition of transition metal nitride films, the
development trends from the precursor chemistry point
of view are: finding more reactive nitrogen precursors
to replace ammonia; and finding reducing agents to
reduce the metal ion to the formal oxidation state ofq
III. These trends will be addressed in Section 5. One
way to overcome the problems with nitrogen precursors
and reducing agents is the use of plasma-assisted ALD
(see Section 6 ).
3. Reaction mechanisms
The ALD reactors used in industrial scale and often
in laboratories, are of a flow-type which makes fast
pulsing and purging possible. In the flow-type reactors
the pressures are 1–10 mbar which limits the selection
of possible in situ characterization methods. Quartz
crystal microbalance(QCM ) has successfully been used
to examine several ALD oxide processes w52,53 x.
Recently , a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS )-ALD
reactor set-up has been presented w54,55 x, and also a
QMS–QCM–ALD combination has been used w56 x.
Optical techniques form another group of methods,
which have been used to characterize surface processes
in flow type ALD reactorsw16 x. Both surface photo
absorption (SP A ) and reflectance difference spectrosco-
py have been employed. A variation from the SP A
technique is termed incremental dielectric reflection
(IDR ) method and it has been used in analysis of ALD
growth of TiO w57 x. It is worth mentioning that the2
limitation of optical characterization methods is the lack
of chemical information.
The in situ measurements allow the investigation of
reaction mechanisms in ALD reaction steps. The QCM
signal shows the relative weight of the adsorbed species,
while the QMS gives information on the gaseous species
releasing in the surface reaction. The measurements are
complementary and the results agreew56 x. The in situ
studies have verified the importance of surface groups
in ALD growth. The measurements show, for example
in the case of oxide films, how many ligands are released
when the metal precursor reacts with the surface –OH
groups, i.e. the mechanism of the adsorption step. During
the last 2 years several oxide processes involving water
as an oxygen source have been studied by QCM. The
metal precursors in these studies have been: titanium
chloridew58,59 x; titanium iodide w32 x; titanium ethoxide
w60 x; titanium isopropoxide w61 x; trimethyl aluminum
w55,62 x; vanadyl isopropoxide w48 x; tantalum iodide
w36 x; and diethyl zinc w63 x. QMS or QMS–QCM com-
binations have been used in studies of reactions of water
with titanium chloridew64 x, titanium isopropoxide w65 x,
and titanium, niobium and tantalum ethoxides w66 x.I n
situ studies can also give useful information on ternary
systems. The example on SrTiO shows that the adsorp-3
tion of titanium isopropoxide on SrO is different than
the adsorption of strontium bis (tri-isopropylcyclopenta-
dienyl ) on TiO , and more strikingly the growth of SrO2
on SrO is very different than that on TiO w67 x. The2
first QMS study on nitride process regarding deposition
of TiN and Ti (Al )N, has also been carried out w68 x.
In situ studies on different titanium precursors in
ALD of TiO at 250 8C revealed an interesting and2
quite unexpected difference in reaction mechanisms;
while TiCl lost one and Ti (OP r ) two ligands ini
44
reactions with surface hydroxyl groups when arriving
on the surface, less than 10% of the ligands in
Ti(OEt ) were released at this stage. This suggests that4
Ti (OEt ) adsorbs molecularly rather than undergoing4
exchange reactions with surface hydroxyl groups. On
the other hand, as the other two cases indicate, there
clearly should be hydroxyl groups on the TiO surface2
at this temperature for Ti (OEt ) to react with. Therefore,4
another explanation for the observed difference is an
adsorption of ethanol formed during the Ti (OEt ) pulse4
so that it becomes released from the surface only when
replaced by water during the next pulse. Separate exper-
iments verified the ethanol adsorption on TiO under2
these conditions. Above 250 8C, the behavior of TiCl 4
resembled that of Ti (OEt ) , whereas Ti (OP r ) startedi
44
to decompose. The decomposition of Ti (OEt ) com-4
menced beyond 300 8C.
Besides examining the form in which the precursor is
adsorbed on the surface, the in situ studies can also give
information on several other aspects, like reaction by-
product re-adsorption and possible etching processes.
The latter is important especially when growing niobium
or tantalum oxide from pentachlorides.
4. Oxide films
The recent ALD oxide studies have often dealt with
growth mechanism investigations, but also the structural
properties of the films have been of interest
w32,37,38,69,70 x. One important material type of ALD
oxides is nanolaminates which consist of alternating
layers of two or more insulator materials, so that each
separate layer has a thickness in a range of 1–20 nm.
The preparation of nanolaminates with accurately vary-
ing composition depth profiles is straightforward in
ALD. In nanolaminates the advantageous properties of
each component can be retained, for example, in insu-
lators: high permittivity; low leakage current density;
and high charge storage capacityw16 x. Recently , the
effects of niobium oxide layers to tantalum oxide and
aluminum oxide have been studiedw71,72 x. It was
shown, for example, that the permittivity of Al O can 23
be increased with Nb O addition without considerable25
loss in resistivity . The films containing 37 cation%
niobium showed similar leakage currents as aluminum
oxide films, but upon further increase in Nb content the
leakage currents increased markedly .

The ALD oxide films find industrial applications as
dielectrics in electroluminescent thin film displays, but
in the future gate oxides for MOSFET transistors will
also perhaps be processed by ALD. The new gate oxides
which will replace SiO are very thin, they must be2
deposited on bare silicon surface, the interface between
silicon and the oxide should be tailored, and the gate
oxide may also be a multilayer structure. All these
requirements are demanding but not impossible for
ALD. The gate oxides must be stable on silicon and the
materials under investigation are Al, Zr, Hf and rare
earth oxides. As mentioned above, all these oxide
materials have been deposited by ALDw16 x. The focus
in the investigations has recently been in structural and
electrical characterization of thin oxide films on silicon.
High resolution depth-profiling of ultrathin Al O films23
on Si revealed stoichiometric composition and abrupt
interface, and showed that ALD Al O is a possible gate23
dielectric material for MOS devices with equivalent
electrical thickness in the sub 2 nm range w73 x. The
robustness of the ultrathin Al O films on Si was studied 23
by high-temperature vacuum annealing at 900 8C and
oxidation at 600 8C. The results showed that the films
were stable in vacuum, but formation of interfacial
SiO took place during oxidationw74 x. The MOSFET2
results on ALD Al O (t s13 A ) for 0.08 mm gate23 e q ˚
length transistors with poly-Si gates showed a reduction
in leakage current of two orders of magnitude compared
to SiO having the samet -value w75 x. Also, the first2e q
results on electrical properties of stacked ALD oxide
layers (aluminum or zirconium ) on SiO have been2
promising w76,77 x. In a very recent study , Gusev et al.
w78 x found that 1.5–10-nm-thick ALD Zr, Hf, Y and Al
oxides on silicon all exhibited good interface quality ,
and gate leakage much lower than conventional SiO of2
the same equivalent electrical thickness. Earlier, they
had shown that a highly uniform layer of ZrO can be2
deposited as thin as 2 nm on top of an SiO layer w79 x.2
The SiO layer was needed, although it limits the2
minimum achievable t -value, because uniform zirco-eq
nium oxide is difficult to grow on Si–H terminated
surface with the chloride process. In fact, getting a good
start for the growth of any oxide on Si–H surface is
clearly an important issue for gate oxide applications of
ALD. Perkins et al.w80 x have shown that ALD process-
ing of polycrystalline ZrO (5n m ) on silicon produces2
an amorphous layer (1.5 nm ), which has higher dielec-
tric constant than SiO . The whole structure has t s132e q
A and shows leakage value of 10 A ycm at a bias ofy52˚
y1V .
The nanolaminate concept has so far been slightly
problematic in gate oxide application since the permit-
tivity of the oxide films decreases significantly with the
film thickness. Equivalent thicknesses of approximately
3 nm have been achieved in Ta–Hf, Ta–Zr and Zr–Hf
oxide nanolaminatesw81 x. In another study Ta, Ta–Nb–
O, Zr–Al–O, and Zr–Al–Nb–O oxide and nanolami-
nates were examined w82 x. When Ta O was deposited25
on silicon, an 8-A-thick SiO layer was formed, but the 2˚
capacitance equivalent oxide thickness of Ta O was 25
1.2–1.5 nm. The leakage current density in those films
was approximately 5 =10 A ycm at 1 MV ycm. Iny42
Zr–Al–O films, the relatively high permittivity of
ZrO was combined with high resistivity of Al O , and22 3
films with t s2–2.5 nm and low leakage could beeq
deposited. When niobium was added to Zr–Al–O, teq
could be lowered to 1.8–2.0 nm w82 x. Besling et al.
w83 x achieved better results with ZrO yAl O nanolam-22 3
inates; t was 1.1 nm and leakage current density seq
10 A ycm at 1 V .y72
The other concern in deposition of gate oxides is that
silicon should not oxidize during the deposition process.
One possibility to avoid that is not to use any strongly
oxidizing precursor. Metal alkoxides have successfully
been used as oxygen source materials in ALD deposition
and no oxidation of silicon was observedw4 x. The
formation of metal silicates when Si (OEt ) or4
Si (OBu ) was used as alkoxide was an important result4
since silicates may be useful gate dielectric materials
too. The exchange reactions between metal halides and
alkoxides have further been studied with tantalum oxide
and titaniumyzirconium oxide w84,85 x. The growth pro-
ceeds without water, but water can be added as a
supplementary oxygen source. The growth rate is
dependent on temperature and the growth rate can be
increased by introducing the precursors simultaneously
(CVD mode ) into the reactor. A further extension of
this chemistry is the use of metal alkyl amides like
Hf(NR ) and ( BuO ) SiOH w42 x.t
24 3
In the future, DRAM capacitors high- k materials are
needed, Ba Sr TiO being the most extensively stud-1 yxx 3
ied material. Recently , ALD processes have been devel-
oped for barium and strontium titanates w16,86 x using
Sr and Ba cyclopentadienyl compounds as precursors,
together with titanium iospropoxide and water. Excellent
conformality was achieved in the ALD STO films and
the films were crystalline as-deposited at 3258C w16 x.
Permittivity values decrease along the decreasing film
thickness, but a value of 100 has been obtained in a 50-
nm-thick film. Further works have focused on integra-
tion of STO and BTO films with platinum electrodes
w87 x. If alkaline earth b-diketonates are used as precur-
sors, the oxygen source must be ozone and deposition
post-annealing in air is needed to achieve crystalline
titanate phasew88 x.
5. Nitride films
Transition metal nitride films are used in ICs as
barriers preventing interdiffusion and reactions between
metals and silicon or insulators. The barrier films in
metallization have strict demands: they should be pure;

143M. Leskela, M. Ritala / Thin Solid Films 409 (2002) 138–146¨
dense; conductive; conformal; thin; have good adhesion
towards metals and insulators; and the processing tem-
perature should not exceed 4008C. The conformality
requirement is especially demanding since the aspect
ratios of trenches and vias have increased. The require-
ments concerning process technique can be fulfilled by
ALD. The materials studied for this purpose are TiN,
TaN and Ta metal. Several ALD nitride processes have
been developed and in most of them, ammonia is used
as a nitrogen sourcew15,16 x. The problem usually is
how to get the transition metal reduced to the formal q
III state needed; especially for TaN, a strong reducing
agent is needed, otherwise a dielectric Ta N phase is35
obtained w89 x.
The majority of the ALD transition metal nitride
processes have been based on metal chlorides and
ammonia. Best results have been obtained with metallic
zinc as an additional reducing agentw89,90 x. Because
zinc-containing processes are not acceptable in semicon-
ductor applications, new processes are sought. With
titanium iodide, a well conducting nitride film can be
deposited without zincw31 x. Studies to find new reducers
or more effective nitrogen precursors in combination
with metal halides are in progress. As examples, the use
of trimethylaluminum(TMA ) as a reducing agent w91 x
and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine as a nitrogen precursor w92 x
can be mentioned. Low TMA doses clearly assist the
formation of nitride films. Dimethylhydrazine reduces
Ti, Nb and Mo chlorides and the corresponding low-
resistivity nitride films are formed at 4008C and, in the
case of TiN, even at 250–400 8C w92 x. However, TaCl 5
cannot be reduced by dimethylhydrazine.
The growth rate in the chloride–ammonia processes
has been low, typically 0.2 A ycycle. It is not known˚
whether this is due to a small number of reactive –
NH groups left on the surface after the NH pulse, orx 3
due to an adsorption site blocking by re-adsorbed reac-
tion byproduct HCl. Elers et al. w93 x were, however,
able to almost double the growth rate by in situ reducing
titanium chloride with metallic titanium. TiCl species3
formed seemed to be able to utilize the active surface
site more effectively than TiCl . The WF –NH process46 3
mentioned above has resulted in a remarkably higher
growth rate of 2.55 Aycycle w28 x. The TiN films made˚
by chloride–ammonia processes have shown 100% con-
formance w2,93 x and good barrier properties up to 650
8C w94 x. Barrier characteristics of 10- and 20-nm-thick
ALD TiN films deposited at 350 and 400 8C were
examined by high frequency capacitance yvoltage meas-
urements on MOS capacitors (Cu gate, TiN, SiO 2
dielectric and TaN passivation ). The capacitors were
stressed at 2 MV ycm at 200 and 300 8Cf o r4h .A
rapid initial flatband shift took place but stressing for
longer times did not cause any further shift indicating
no significant Cu diffusion into SiOw95 x. The biased2
temperature stress tests of 3 nm TiN films deposited on
200-mm wafers have shown excellent leakage properties
after stressing up to 2 MV ycm at 200 8C for 12 days
w96 x.
Transition metal nitride films can be deposited from
alkyl amides and ammonia with high growth rate at low
temperaturesw42,43 x, but the alkyl amides are also quite
prone to self-decomposition. TiN films deposited by
these reactions have been amorphous and contained
some carbon(4 at.% ) and hydrogen (6 at.% ) impurities
w97 x. The films have shown excellent conformality and
negligible interdiffusion of Cu and yor Si at temperatures
lower than 600 8C, but 650 8C triggered the diffusion
w98 x. Silicon containing films have shown better barrier
properties; for example in a Cu yTi Si N ySiO y0.32 0.18 0.50 2
Si structure, no interdiffusion was detected after anneal-
ing at 800 8C for 60 min in H (10% )–Ar (90% ) w43 x.2
The films suffered from high resistivities, however.
6. Metal films and plasma-ALD
A copper ALD process would offer an interesting
alternative for IC metallizations. Cu films have been
deposited by ALD using hydrogen as a reducing agent
for CuCl and Cu(thd ) w99 x. Both processes seem to be2
substrate material-dependent, indicating that the sub-
strate (Pt and Pd ) actively participates or catalyzes the
growth reaction. CuCl and also MoCl can also be 5
reduced to metal by zinc vapor w100,101 x. The processes
suffer, however, from a reversible dissolution-outdiffu-
sion of zinc into the Cu and Mo films. The well-known
solution(electroless deposition ) chemistry for copper
deposition where the reduction is carried out by organic
compounds(formaldehyde, alcohols ) has successfully
been employed in ALD w102 x. The Cu precursor used
was 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate and
low-resistivity(1.78–4.25 mV) films were deposited at
300 8C. Other thermal ALD metal processes studied so
far involve tungsten and nickel. In deposition of tung-
sten, the WF –Si H –process was employedw27 x. Nick-62 6
el deposition involves a two-step process where first
NiO is grown from Ni (acac ) and ozone and then the2
oxide is converted to metal upon annealing in hydrogen
atmosphere at 260 8C w103 x.
In deposition of nitride and metal films thermal energy
is not necessarily enough to activate the reactions.
Therefore, plasma enhanced growth has also been intro-
duced to ALD. Thin films of inert refractory materials
are used in semiconductor interconnect applications as
diffusion barrier, seed and adhesion layers. Ta and Tiy
TiN films are typical examples of these. Rossnagel et
al.w104 x deposited 100% conformal Ta and Ti films at
25–400 8C using a plasma enhanced ALD process,
where TaCl and TiCl were reduced by atomic hydrogen54
generated upstream with an inductively coupled RF
plasma discharge. Chlorine residues were below 3 at.%
and the films deposited below 2508C were amorphous.

144 M. Leskela, M. Ritala / Thin Solid Films 409 (2002) 138–146¨
More detailed studies of Ti films with QCM system and
several different substrate materials have revealed that
the growth process is independent of TiCl exposure4
above 5000 L, and the growth is also saturated with
increasing hydrogen plasma power and atomic hydrogen
exposure timew105 x.
Atomic hydrogen has also facilitated the epitaxial
growth of silicon at 550–610 8C from dichlorosilane
both on silicon (100 ) and (111 ) surfaces w106,107 x. The
ideal 1 ML ycycle growth can be achieved only when
hydrogen pressure is optimized.
Plasma assistance has also been used in ALD growth
of nitride and oxide films. T etrabutylimido-
tris(diethylamido )tantalum has been reduced to TaN by
hydrogen radicals produced by capacitively coupled RF
plasma sourcew46 x. The use of nitrogen radicals is also
possible w108 x. High-quality aluminum oxide films have
been deposited by plasma enhanced ALD. After the
aluminum precursor(dimethylethylamine alane ) pulse,
the reactor was pumped down and H plasma was 2
introduced. Then the aluminum layer was oxidized with
O plasmaw109 x; 15-nm-thick Al O films were grown22 3
by repeating the process. The films showed very good
electrical properties and the properties could be even
improved by post-deposition oxygen-plasma annealing
at 2008C. The advantages of O plasma have also been 2
shown in deposition of tantalum oxide films from
ethoxide and aminoethoxide { Ta (OEt ) wOC H N42 4
(CH )x } , zirconium oxide film from t-butoxide and32
aluminum oxide from TMA w110,111 x. For example, the
growth rate could be increased by 50–100% by using
the O plasma.2
7. Conclusions
The ALD method has already shown its versatility in
industrial use for deposition of dielectric and lumines-
cent films for electroluminescent flat panel displays.
The big challenge to ALD is to gain an established
position in microelectronics. It has great potential
because of the accurate thickness control in deposition
of very thin films and 100% conformality . The first
processes suggested for ALD in microelectronics are
TiN barriers and gate oxides. The use of plasma acti-
vation will expand the ALD thin film materials selection.
Because of the promising results obtained with plasma-
ALD, it will surely increase in use in the future.
