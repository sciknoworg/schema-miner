IntroductionThe search for SiO2 high ? replacements (? is the dielec-tric constant) continues to receive considerable attention as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) tech-nology shrinks [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5]. Advancements in this area, pertaining to materials chemistry, test the require-ments of ultra-thin film processing of insulating binary or higher order oxides, devoid of impurity atoms (e.g. halides) [1]. The numerous attributes of these layers (thinness, con-formal coverage, compatibility with terminated silicon sur-faces, abrupt interfaces, thermal processing, etc.) necessitate both new material developments as well as novel deposition techniques. Concerning the former, various Group III oxides are currently being explored, from Al2O3 to its heavier con-geners Ln2O3 (lanthanide3+ ions). For the latter one promis-ing growth method is atomic layer deposition (ALD) whose layer-by-layer, self-terminating mechanisms ideally offer ex-quisite control over thin film thickness, interfaces, stoichiom-etry, and surface roughness to mention only a few possible ad-vantages [6] and [7].ALD (and chemical vapor deposition, CVD) may also benefit from new chemical precursor design. Although the de-sired properties of ALD precursors remain debatable [7], each source must be volatile and show appropriate reactivity at the growth surface. Furthermore, liquid or gaseous sources of-fer certain industrial and academic advantages. For example, liquids often exhibit weaker intermolecular forces than sol-ids, suggesting higher volatility, and always provide constant surface areas minimizing changes in vapor flux over time and are easier to handle and transfer. Although numerous alumina source molecules have been evaluated, Al2(CH3)6 (and se-lect hydrides) is the most common starting material [3], [4], [5], [8] and [9]. However, as a hypergolic gas it is not without drawbacksmost important industrially are its dangerous, ex-plosive properties. Thus, novel aluminum sources of similar volatility, decreased ambient atmosphere reactivity, and appli-cability to ALD or CVD are desirable.To assess potential alternatives to trimethylaluminum (TMA) we began investigating homoleptic Al3+ aminos as ALD precursors [10], [11] and [12]. Previously, this general class of molecules received only modest attention from the Published in Materials Letters  61:29 (December 2007), pp. 5079-5082; doi:10.1016/j.matlet.2007.04.009 .

Characterization includes vapor pressure measurements and comparison of the two non-pyrophoric precursors showing them to be viable alternatives to trimethylaluminum. Ultimately, tris(diisopropyl)aluminum was successful in the atomic layer deposition of alumina thin films.

This led us to the development of ultrapure tris(diethylamino)aluminum (Al(DEA)3, 1), a liquid, and solid tris(diisopropylamino)aluminum (Al(DIA)3, 2) and tris (bis(trimethylsilyl)amino)aluminum (Al(TMSA)3) (Figure 1). These materials were hy-pothesized to show appropriate reactivity for ALD and ox-ide growth and 1.) their steric bulk should trigger the self-ter-minating paths and 2.) thermodynamics favor formation of an AlO bond over the AlN bond [15]. In addition, 1 and 2 show appreciable volatility (see below)comparable to thatof Al2(CH3)6 and were successfully implemented in the growth of amorphous alumina using H2O as a coreactant. 2. ExperimentalAll manipulations were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques. Lithium aluminum hydride (95%, LiAlH4), alu-minum chloride (99.99%, AlCl3), diethylamine (redistilled, 99.5%), and diisopropylamine (redistilled, 99.95%) were pur-chased from Aldrich and used as received. AlH3·N(CH3)3 was purchased from Gelest and used as received. Benzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried and distilled from sodium prior to use. Elemental analyses were performed by Mid-west Microlabs (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and 1H NMR was re-corded at 400 MHz. The ALD chamber has been previously described [16].2.1. Synthesis of tris(diethylamino)aluminum (Al(DEA)3, 1)A 250 mL, 2-neck, round bottom flask charged with a stir bar and LiAlH4 (2.0 g, 0.053 mol) was sealed with a re-flux condenser and a 100 mL addition funnel. Sequentially, the vessel was removed from the glove box, interfaced to a N2-containing Schlenk line and 60 mL of THF was introduced via syringe. Diethylamine (22 mL, 0.21 mol) was then added Figure 1. Structures of tris(diethylamino)aluminum and tris(diisopropyl)aluminum. Figure 2.

Following complete evolution of H2 (~ 30 min), AlCl3 (2.4 g, 0.018 mol) in 26 mL of THF was added dropwise (2 drops/s) and the mixture heated at reflux for 1 h. Upon cooling to room temperature, the THF was removed via azeotrope dis-tillation with benzene (125 mL) and the mixture concentrated to ~ 50 mL. The reaction was filtered through a fine poros-ity fritted funnel and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 0.15 Torr) result-ing in an orange oil. Pure Al(DEA)3 was isolated as a color-less oil via vacuum distillation (150 °C, 10 4 Torr). Yield 60% (7.7 g); 1H NMR (?, C6D6) 1.15 (m, 3H); 1.38 (m, 3H), 3.1 (m, 2H), 3.35 (m, 2H); Elem. Anal.

Synthesis of tris(diisopropylamino)aluminum (Al(DIA)3, 2)63 mL (8.8 eq, 0.45 mol) of diisopropylamine was slowly added (2 drops/s) to a cooled (liquid N2) 250 mL flask con-taining 4.5 g AlH3·N(CH3)3 (0.051 mol). H2 evolution was immediately apparent. After amine addition the flask warmed to ambient temperature (2 h) and subsequently heated at re-flux overnight. Excess amine was removed in vacuo and the crude product sublimed at 85 °C and 10? 4 Torr to yield color-less crystals (6.9 g, 42%). 1H NMR (?, C6D6) 1.3 (d, 6H), 3.4 (sept., 1H); Elem. Anal.

Results and discussionThe synthetic methods utilized to arrive at these novel alumina precursors have one commonalityto minimize halide content and cost [10], [11] and [12]. The preparation of Al(DEA)3 uses inexpen-sive LiAlH4 as the aluminum source whereas Al(DIA)3 employs the alane, AlH3·NMe3. The purpose of these routes was to ultimately reduce contamination and charge carriers in the derived dielectric layer [1]. From the atmospheric pressure thermogravimetric analy-sis (TGA, Figure 2) both precursors evaporate with onset tempera-tures of 200 °C and 150 °C for 1 and 2, respectively. Although coun-terintuitive since 1 is a liquid, it is believed to exist as a dimer in this phase but evaporates as the monomer requiring more energy to break its dimeric structure [10], [15] and [17]. This is unlike 2 which exists as a monomer, in both the solid and vapor phase [12]. The TGA data also supports nearly complete evaporation with little residue at ambi-ent pressure and a 50 cc N2 flow. Al(DEA)3 leaves less than 4% resi-due while under identical conditions Al(DIA)3 has an initially higher residual of ~ 10%. This suggests that 2 is more susceptible to atmo-spheric contamination rather than decomposition, since the percent-age varied amongst runs and approaches zero at reduced pressures. To evaluate the vapor pressure of these new precursors versus the industry standard trimethylaluminum (Al2(CH3)6) measurements were undertaken and fit to a modified ClausiusClapeyron equation (supplemental information). From these data TMA is significantly more volatile than both Al(DEA)3 and Al(DIA)3, however Al(DIA)3 is one to two orders of magnitude more volatile than Al(DEA)3 in the high (> 70 °C) and low temperature (< 70 °C) regimes, respec-tively. At higher temperatures these values become less disparate but do not cross; thus 2 is always more volatile than 1. Surprisingly both TMA and Al(DEA)3 are liquids and dinuclear, making them structur-ally and chemically similar. From this observation we postulate that the greater vapor pressure of Al(DIA)3 over Al(DEA)3 is due to its mononuclear character. Although it is typical for liquids to exhibit weaker intermolecular forces, in this case it is a compromise between similar dispersive forces, molecular weight, and the energy required to break dimeric Al(DEA)3.All films were deposited on cleaned Si(100) coupons in a pre-viously described hot-walled ALD reactor [16]. Initially films were grown to optimize suitable delivery conditions for the ALD growth regime using 2 at a constant precursor source temperature of 70 °C (where the vapor pressures of Al(DEA)3 and Al(DEA)3 become least disparate). This resulted in a usable parameter of 3, 2 s plugs of compound 2. These plugs consist of the precursor vessel being slightly pressurized with carrier gas (N2, 240 mTorr from 100 mTorr) and then the metal-organic being evacuated into the growth chamber at 100 mTorr. To verify precursor purge time and self limiting growth film, thickness was monitored as a function of seconds, and after 20 s found to be stable and linear (Figure 3A). Two additional contributing factors that were investigated were substrate temperature and oxidizer purge time. First it was found that growth became nonlinear beyond 325 °C at which point Al2O3 thick-ness per cycles increased, presumably due to decomposition at the silicon substrate (Figure 3B). The second factor was oxidizer deliv-ery, for 2 a 50 ms pulse (carrier gas passed through a water bubbler cooled in an ice bath) followed by a 30 s purge yielded optimal con-ditions and growth. These H2O values are nearly identical to those found for 1 [16]. Using these conditions the thickness versus num-ber of cycles was linear from 100 Å to 220 Å with an incubation pe-riod of 13 Å before growth stabilized at 0.73 Å/cycle (Figure 3C). Granted these data points do not include thicknesses below 100 Å be-cause reliable values in this regime are hard to obtain in our system.The amorphous films were characterized by PXRD and AFM. All attempts to find diffraction peaks failed, even on thicker films, yielding us to conclude they are amorphous despite the complica-tions associated with thinner films and diffraction. The AFM images (Figure 4) of two thin films having thicknesses of 211 Å and 157 Å both have RMS identical roughnesses of 5 Å, over a 1 ?m2 area, at an abrupt atmospheric interface. 4. SummaryThis letter presents the synthesis and characterization of two, non-pyrophoric alternatives for the industry standard TMA  Al(DEA)3 and Al(DIA)3. The compounds were de-signed to minimize halide content and were synthesized from aluminum hydrides instead of chlorides or heavier ha-lides. The latter was used in the ALD growth of alumina on Si(100) whose conditions are explicitly given for a previously described hot-walled reactor. The derived films were amor-phous by PXRD and have abrupt, uniform surfaces with RMS roughnesses of 5 Å.
