Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven,The Netherlands(Received 23 September 2016; accepted 29 November 2016; published 20 December 2016)HfO2 thin films were prepared by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition using a cyclopentadienyl-alkylamido precursor [HfCp(NMe2)3, HyALDTM] and an O2 plasma over a temperature range of150400 C at a growth per cycle around 1.1 A?/cycle. The high purity of the films was demon-strated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elastic recoil detection analyses which revealedthat by increasing the deposition temperature from 200 to 400 C, the atomic concentrations ofresidual carbon and hydrogen reduced from 1.0 to <0.5 at. % and 3.4 to 0.8 at. %, respectively.Moreover, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy studies showed an improvement in stoichiome-try of HfO2 thin films with the increase in deposition temperature, resulting in Hf/O ratio close to0.5 at 400 C. Furthermore, grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements detected a transi-tion from amorphous at the deposition temperature of 300 C to fully polycrystalline films at400 C, consisting of a mixture of monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic phases.

INTRODUCTIONAtomic layer deposition (ALD) of high-k dielectric materi-als has been a subject of intensive research over the past years.Among such high-k oxides, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has beenendorsed largely for the application of high-k gate oxide incomplementary metal oxide semiconductor devices owing toits high permittivity, fairly large band gap, and ability to form athermodynamically stable interface with Si.15 The applicationof HfO2 as a gate oxide material is not only limited to conven-tional Si based devices but also extending its horizons in novelnanomaterials based devices. For instance, Radisavljevic et al.have recently shown that by implementing HfO2 as gate oxidefor a field effect transistor device based on an emerging 2D-nanomaterial, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), the mobilitycould be drastically boosted owing to the suppression of cou-lombic scattering via dielectric screening.6 Furthermore, mostrecently, the application of a gate stack based on HfO2/Al2O3/III-V(In0.53Ga0.47As) for metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitordevices has been demonstrated by Djara et al.7 These deviceshave a HfO2/Al2O3 stack as gate oxide deposited by plasmaenhanced ALD (PEALD) and show a low interface trap density(Dit). Additionally, HfO2 also finds applications as a protectivecoating for microelectromechanical systems and as insulatorfor organic devices such as organic light emitting diode andorganic field effect transistors.810ALD has been the method of choice for depositing thin filmsof HfO2. The self-saturating nature of the ALD process enablesatomic level control over thickness and uniformity and thismakes ALD ideal for preparing ultrathin HfO2 thin films. Inparticular, the much needed conformality over high aspect ratiostructures in combination with the excellent uniformity overlarge surface areas and the pin-hole free nature of the ALD pro-duced thin films makes ALD a befitting deposition process.4,11In ALD, the choice of precursor has a large effect on thequality and properties of the deposited thin films. This leadsto a continuous effort in precursor synthesis aiming atimproving temperature stability and/or reducing impurityconcentrations in the resulting film depending on the finalapplication. In literature, a number of Hf precursors havebeen implemented for HfO2 ALD processes. The establishedALD processes leave a room for improvement in terms ofextension of operating conditions. In this contribution, wehave investigated a novel precursor, HfCp(NMe2)3, in com-bination with O2 plasma which has yielded into a viableHfO2 ALD process with a constant growth rate over the wid-est possible range of operating conditions such that it issuited for a multitude of applications. The details of the pro-cess investigated will be discussed in this paper. However, itis useful to systematically look at established ALD processesas listed in Table I, where a brief overview of effortsa)A. Sharma and V. Longo contributed equally to this work.b)Electronic mail: w.m.m.kessels@tue.nl01B130-1 J. Vac. Sci. Technol.

The most frequently used pre-cursor for HfO2 ALD is HfCl4 which is combined with H2Oor O3 as oxygen source.2,1215 However, the limitations asso-ciated with this precursor, such as corrosive byproducts andpoor nucleation on H-terminated Si at high temperatures(300 C), make this precursor unfavorable for some spe-cific applications like dynamic random-access memories andtherefore have led for a search for alternative precursorchemistries.2,15,16One of such a widely applied alternative precursor groupfor HfO2 ALD is alkylamide comprising metalnitrogenbonds, namely Hf(NEtMe)4 (TEMAH), Hf(NEt2)4, andHf(NMe2)4 (Et¼C2H5, Me¼CH3).3,1720 These alkylamidetype precursors possess a high volatility and reactivity andyield a high growth per cycle (GPC) in combination withH2O or O3 as coreactants.17 However, they suffer from alimited thermal stability which can lead to a parasitic CVDcomponent and might result into high impurity concentra-tions and poor film uniformity.25 In addition, Kukli et al.have demonstrated that the HfO2 ALD process usingTEMAH in combination with H2O as oxygen source leads toan increment in GPC from 0.9 A?/cycle at 250 C to 1.5 A?/cycle at 325 C, indicating the decomposition of the precur-sor at temperatures300 C.17To overcome this, an ALD process using the cyclopenta-dienyl (Cp¼C5H5) precursor type was investigated. A higherthermal stability was achieved and ALD saturation was realizedat a relative high substrate temperature of 400 C.22 However,a lower GPC of 0.5 A?/cycle was obtained when usingCp-precursors like (CpMe)2HfMe2 and (CpMe)2Hf(OMe)Meas compared to the alkylamides (0.9 A?/cycle).19With the aim of combining the benefits of both precursortypes, precursors comprising both cyclopentadienyl andalkylamide type ligands have been investigated.23,24 A highthermal stability and high GPC attributed to cyclopenta-dienyl ligands and alkylamide ligands, respectively, havebeen demonstrated for both Hf and Zr based ALD pro-cesses.23,24,26 For ZrO2, this combined merit of high thermalstability and high growth per cycle has been manifested byusing a chemically analogous precursor, i.e., CpZr(NMe2)3in combination with H2O, where a growth per cycle of0.81 A?/cycle in the temperature range of 120350 C wasobtained.26 However, a similar Hf precursor containingmixed cyclopentadienyl and alkylamide ligands, i.e.,HfCp(NMe2)3 when applied in combination with H2Oyielded a growth per cycle of only 0.230.36 A?/cycle in thetemperature range of 305375 C.23 Furthermore, Niinistoet al. have shown that the use of a stronger oxidant like O3in combination with HfCp(NMe2)3 yields a higher growthper cycle (0.75 A?/cycle) in the temperature range of 250350 C.24 The higher growth in the latter case might be attrib-uted to the high reactivity of O3 at a relatively low temperatureresulting in the efficient removal of the bulky Cp ligands.24However, both with H2O or O3 as oxidizing agents, deposi-tions have not been reported below 250 C, which might benecessary for HfO2 film deposition on temperature-sensitivesubstrates, in particular, for organic device applications andflexible electronics based on novel nanomaterials.10,27 In thiscontext, another alternative is to employ a plasma enhancedALD process (i.e., O2 plasma as oxygen source) in combina-tion with the same Hf precursor [HfCp(NMe2)3] for growth ofHfO2 thin films. It is well known that the use of plasma chem-istry offers potential advantages like improved material proper-ties, feasibility of lower deposition temperatures, andincreased flexibility in process conditions.28In the present study, we report the HfCp(NMe2)3 incombination with an O2 plasma process which yields afairly high growth per cycle over a wide ALD temperaturewindow (150400 C) while retaining the high materialproperties. A detailed characterization of the HfO2 PEALDprocess has been carried out. The dependence of filmgrowth rate on various parameters like growth temperatureand duration of dose during the plasma enhanced ALDprocess has been studied. Furthermore, an elaborated mate-rial characterization elucidating the film structure andcomposition depending on growth temperature has beenperformed. Finally, in order to assert the potential of ALDto deposit conformally on 3D structures, the film confor-mality over high aspect ratio structures has also beendemonstrated.TABLE I.

Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 35, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2017II. EXPERIMENTA. Film depositionThe HfO2 thin films were deposited in an Oxford InstrumentsFlexALTM ALD reactor on 100200 mm Si wafers eitherwith a native oxide layer or H-terminated as created by ahydrofluoric acid (HF)-last process (1% HF). The Hf precur-sor employed was HfCp(NMe2)3, HyALDTM, obtained fromAirLiquide. The precursor was stored in a stainless steel can-ister and heated to 60 C. At this temperature, the vapor pres-sure of the HyALD precursor is approximately 100 mTorr.29For the precursor delivery to the deposition chamber a 100sccm Ar (>99.999% purity) bubbling flow was employed.An Ar purge step with 100 sccm of Ar flow was applied afterthe precursor and plasma exposure steps. To avoid condensa-tion of the precursor, the delivery lines were kept at 90 Cwhile the reactor walls were heated to 120 C. As the oxidiz-ing agent, an O2 (>99.999% purity) plasma generated in aninductively coupled plasma source was used. The reactorpressure during the plasma step was 15 mTorr. The plasmapower used was 400 W. The substrate stage was heated totemperatures in the range of 150400 C during the deposi-tion processes. It is worth mentioning that there was a20%25% difference between the set temperature valueand the actual substrate temperature for the reactor employedin this work.B. Film analysisThe thickness and the optical properties of the HfO2 thinfilms were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Exsitu measurements (J.A. Woollam M2000D) were performedto determine the final thickness and the dielectric function inthe 1.256.5 eV spectral range. The film thickness evolutionduring deposition was monitored by in situ measurements(J.A. Woollam M2000F, 1.255 eV).To determine the elemental composition and the densityof the films Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS)was used. Furthermore, elastic recoil detection (ERD) wasemployed to determine the hydrogen content in the films.Both RBS and ERD were performed using a 2 MeV 4Heþion flux (Acctec BV, The Netherlands). X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) was also performed using a ThermoScientific K-alpha spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kax-ray radiation (h¼ 1486.6 eV). XPS was used to quantifyC and N contaminations in the films due to the higher sensi-tivity of XPS compared to RBS for these elements. For theXPS analysis, a 400 lm diameter spot was used, and photo-electrons were collected at a take-off angle of 60. The sam-ples were neutralized during the XPS analysis using anelectron flood gun in order to correct for differential or non-uniform charging.Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) wasemployed to determine the crystalline phases of the HfO2 thinfilms. The XRD analysis was performed on a PanalyticalXPert PRO MRD employing Cu Ka (1.54 A?) radiation withan incidence angle of 0.5 with respect to the substrate plane.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate thesurface morphology of the films. The AFM scans wereperformed in tapping mode with a NT-MDT Solver P47microscope using a TiN coated Si tip (NSG10/TiN, NT-MDT). Cross-sectional TEM analysis was performed using aJEOL ARM 200 operated at 200 kV. For this, the HfO2 filmwas coated with a SiOx/Pt film stack as a protective layer andsubsequently prepared using a standard FIB lift-out TEMsample preparation scheme.The conformality of HfO2 ALD process was determinedon substrate coupons with high-aspect-ratio (HAR) nano-structures. These HAR nanostructures were created by etch-ing SiO2 grown by PECVD into the Si wafer. The SiO2nanostructures were then coated with a SiNx layer depositedby high-temperature CVD, onto which a SiO2 thin film wasdeposited using ALD. The HfO2 sample was coated with alayer of spin-on epoxy to fill the remaining gaps in thetrenches in order to protect the film from curtaining damageduring the subsequent lift-out FIB sample preparation.III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA. ALD growthThe ALD process was characterized by monitoring theGPC by in situ SE analysis. The influence of dose steps wasinvestigated by varying the duration of the precursor step,the O2 plasma step and the purge steps between each halfcycle. Figures 1(a)1(d) show the GPC values obtained at asubstrate temperature of 250 C when varying the HyALDand O2 plasma exposure steps [Figs. 1(a) and 1(c), respec-tively], and purge times after the precursor dose and theplasma exposure step [Figs. 1(b) and 1(d), respectively]. TheGPC showed a clear saturation behavior for both the precur-sor and the plasma half cycles resulting in a GPC value of1.1 A?/cycle. The Ar purge after the HyALD dose showed anegligible influence on the GPC [Fig. 1(b)]. Also, when nopurge step was applied after the precursor dose step, theGPC value did not show a remarkable change. By supplyingO2 during all ALD steps, including the precursor dose, it wasverified that the HyALD precursor does not react with themolecular oxygen in the process space investigated, thusexcluding the presence of a parasitic CVD component.The duration of the purge step applied after the plasmastep showed however an influence on the growth, in partic-ular a higher GPC was recorded with a decreasing purgetime. This is likely caused due to a parasitic CVD growthcomponent due to chemical reactions between the by-products after the plasma step (i.e., H2O) and the HyALDprecursor when low purge times are employed. On the basisof the results in Fig. 1, to guarantee a genuine saturationbehavior of precursor and purge steps, a precursor/purge/plasma/purge sequence of 5/2/8/5 s was chosen in thiswork.The influence of the substrate temperature on the GPCwas also determined. Figure 2(a) shows the thickness evo-lution of HfO2 films deposited at substrate stage tempera-tures ranging between 150 and 400 C as obtained from insitu SE. For all temperatures studied, the films showed alinear growth trend without growth delay as expected for atypical O2 plasma ALD process. Figure 2(b) shows the01B130-3 Sharma et al.: Atomic layer deposition of HfO2 01B130-3JVST A - Vacuum, Surfaces, and FilmsGPC values as calculated from Fig. 2(a), corresponding tothe studied substrate stage temperatures and the averagenumber of Hf atoms deposited per ALD cycle as deter-mined from RBS measurements. As mentioned above, thehigh thermal stability of HfCp(NMe2)3 allows to explorea larger temperature window.29 The GPC value remainsconstant at around 1.1 A?/cycle for the whole range of sub-strate stage temperatures from 150400 C signifying thedecomposition-free deposition.The relatively higher GPC value at low temperatures(150200 C) can be attributed to a higher incorporation ofimpurities combined with a lower density of the films for lowerdeposition temperatures. This hypothesis was confirmed by theelemental composition analysis carried out by XPS and RBS asreported in Table II. The film densities were obtained throughthe combined RBS and SE analysis, and the stoichiometricratios for Hf/O were determined from the RBS areal densityvalues for Hf and O, respectively. As reported in Table II, theHf/O ratio increased with increasing deposition temperatureand an excellent stoichiometric value close to 0.5 wasachieved at 400 C. The over-stoichiometric films (i.e., oxygenrich) obtained at lower deposition temperatures might be attrib-uted to the formation of hydroxyl impurities. The hydroxylimpurities are directly related to the H content which decreasedwith the increasing deposition temperature. Furthermore, the Nand C levels were below 1 and 2 at. % irrespective of the depo-sition temperature. The corresponding XPS depth profile spec-tra for the films deposited at the substrate stage temperature of400 C are shown in Fig. 1 of the supplementary material.35The low N and C levels obtained are a clear merit, as in earlierwork the performance of devices with HfO2 has clearly shownto degrade with increasing impurity levels.30,31 Moreover, aswill be shown in Sec. III B, the degree of crystallinity increasesfor higher deposition temperatures.FIG. 1.

Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 35, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2017As mentioned above, the GPC obtained in this work(1.1 A?/cycle) is considerably higher than the previouslyreported values in the literature when using HfCp(NMe2)3 incombination with H2O (0.230.36 A?/cycle) or O3 (0.75 A?/cycle) as oxidizing agents. This can likely be attributed to thecreation of a higher density of reactive surface sites for pre-cursor adsorption owing to the higher reactivity of plasmaspecies.28 It is also worth mentioning that the usage of plasmaspecies leads to reduction in purge time resulting in shortercycle times, which impact the overall ALD process through-put.28 This is corroborated by the fact that HfCp(NMe2)3 incombination with H2O requires a long post-H2O purge time(30 s)23 as compared to post-O2 plasma purge time (5 s) in thiswork which therefore increases the net ALD throughput.B. Optoelectronic properties and crystallinityThe optical properties of HfO2 films have been analyzedby ex situ SE. Cauchy and B-spline models were used forobtaining the dielectric functions in the fully transparent andabsorbing regions, respectively. Figure 3 shows the dielectricfunction, i.e., the real (e1) and imaginary part (e2), of 32 nmHfO2 films deposited in the temperature range studied. Theimaginary part of dielectric function was used to determinethe Tauc band gap by plotting (e2E2)1/2 as a function of photonenergy and extrapolating the linear part to zero absorption.The resulting band gap values obtained by this procedure islisted in Table II, and a Tauc plot corresponding to the filmdeposited at a substrate stage temperature of 400 C is shownin the supplementary material (Fig. 2). As evident in Fig. 3,the films deposited at higher temperatures have the higher val-ues of e1 in the regions with e2¼ 0. The higher value of e1 cor-responds to a higher refractive index and is consistent withthe elemental analysis: less impurities and a higher density forthin films deposited at high temperatures. Furthermore, thedielectric function of the film deposited at 400 C shows dis-tinctive sharp features, both in e1 and e2, compared to theother films. These features can be imputed to a polycrystallinenature of the film leading to sharper electronic transitions. Anonset from a smooth dielectric function (<300 C) to one withsharper features (400 C) for the film deposited at 350 C isvisible in the inset of Fig. 3.These findings were corroborated by GI-XRD analysis ofthe same films as shown in Fig. 4. The GI-XRD spectra ofthe film deposited at 200 C showed no distinctive diffrac-tion peaks, and only a broad peak at 2 32 was detectedcorresponding to amorphous HfO2. The film deposited at300 C also showed a broad peak at 2 32 while a broaddiffraction peak with weak intensity, corresponding to the(111) peak of the monoclinic phase, could be detected. Thisindicates that the HfO2 thin films studied were mostly amor-phous for deposition temperatures up to 300 C. Whenincreasing the deposition temperature to 350 C, a clear tran-sition in the GI-XRD spectra could be seen. Diffractionpeaks corresponding to the monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubicHfO2 phases were detected, indicating a higher degree ofcrystallinity as compared to lower deposition temperaturesof 200 and 300 C. By further increasing the substrate stagetemperature to 400 C, peaks having higher intensity weremeasured indicating a higher degree of crystallinity. Themonoclinic phase appeared to be dominant at this depositiontemperature.TABLE II. Elemental composition of HfO2 films as determined by RBS, ERDand XPS.

The substrate stage temperatures during deposition areindicated by the labels. The subscripts M, T, and C at indices denote mono-clinic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, respectively. The spectra show a cleartemperature dependence of the HfO2 film crystallinity with a transition fromamorphous to polycrystalline films embarking at a temperature of 300 C.01B130-5 Sharma et al.: Atomic layer deposition of HfO2 01B130-5JVST A - Vacuum, Surfaces, and FilmsThe GI-XRD patterns obtained in this work are remark-ably similar to the ones reported by Niinisto et al.,24 for theHfO2 ALD process employing the same precursor,HfCp(NMe2)3, and O3 as the oxidizing agent. In their work,Niinisto et al. showed a similar temperature dependence ofthe HfO2 film crystallinity with a clear transition from amor-phous to crystalline films at a deposition temperature of300 C. The difference in temperature between this work andthe one reported by Niinisto et al. at which this transitioncould be observed is imputed to a 20%25% differencebetween the set stage temperature value and the actual sub-strate temperature for the reactor employed in this work.32 Itcan be concluded that the crystallization temperature ofHfO2 films is rather independent of the oxygen source usedin combination with HfCp(NMe2)3 during the ALD process.However, the usage of a plasma-assisted ALD process mayopen the possibility for tuning of the crystalline phase by ionbombardment by employing substrate biasing during proc-essing,33 which is the object of further investigation.Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional TEM image of a32 nm HfO2 film deposited at 400 C on H-terminated Sisubstrate. The full Si/HfO2 (32 nm)/SiOx (100 nm)/Pt stackis shown in Fig. 5(a). The HfO2 film shows a sharp interfacewith the underlying Si substrate, while an interface withhigher roughness was formed with the overlying protectiveSiOx layer due to the crystalline HfO2 grains.A close inspection of Fig. 5(b) reveals the presence of anamorphous SiO2 layer at the Si/HfO2 interface. The amor-phous nature of the Si substrate is imputed to damage causedby the focused ion beam used during sample preparation.The TEM image shows that the HfO2 film is fully crystallinewhich is in line with the GI-XRD analysis. Furthermore,individual HfO2 grains can be identified [Fig. 5(b)] with anaverage lateral grain size of 2030 nm.C. Surface morphologyThe AFM scans over an area of 500 500 nm2 for the32 nm thick HfO2 films (300 ALD cycles) deposited at200, 300, 350, and 400 C are depicted in Figs. 6(a), 6(b),6(c), and 6(d), respectively. The root-mean-square (RMS)roughness values obtained from 2 2 lm2 AFM scans ofthe same samples are indicated in Figs. 6(a)6(d). Forthe film deposited at 200 C, a very smooth surface (RMS¼ 1.29 nm) with very few randomly distributed singularfeatures was obtained [see Fig. 6(a)]. The higher substratestage temperature of 300 and 350 C yielded an increase indensity and size of these singular features as depicted inFigs. 6(b) and 6(c). The RMS roughness values alsoshowed an increment with increasing deposition tempera-ture from 200 to 350 C. AFM scans of the HfO2 sampledeposited at 400 C revealed a slightly different film mor-phology with a decreased RMS roughness value comparedto the film deposited at 350 C [Fig. 6(d)]. On the basis ofthe obtained morphology, it can be argued that the singularfeatures observed might be associated with the increasingdegree of crystallinity with the increase in deposition tem-perature from 200 to 350 C resulting in a transition fromamorphous to polycrystalline films as shown before in Figs.3 and 4 corresponding to the SE and GI-XRD analyses.Furthermore, the lower RMS roughness value obtainedat 400 C might be attributed to the full crystallizationobtained already during the deposition process leading to alaterally homogeneous and smooth HfO2 thin film, which isalso supported by TEM image (Fig. 5).This effect was also confirmed for thicker films asdepicted in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f) with 500 500 nm2 AFMscans of 80 nm HfO2 films deposited at 250 and 400 C,respectively. The RMS roughness values of these two filmsare also indicated in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f). The increase inRMS as a function of layer thickness of the samples grownat 400 C can be explained by grain coarsening, i.e., increasein (lateral) grain size as a function of film height. The filmdeposited at 250 C shows higher surface roughness com-pared to the one deposited at 400 C, most likely because ofcoalescence of individual crystalline grains at 400 C in thetop part of the layer.FIG. 5.

Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 35, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2017D. ConformalityThe conformality of the above HfO2 ALD process wasdetermined by depositing a 20 nm thick HfO2 film overHAR nanostructures with varying aspect ratio (0.69) ata deposition temperature of 250 C. Figure 7 shows across-sectional TEM image of the HAR trench structuresconformally covered with the HfO2 film. It should be notedthat the deposition conditions for this purpose were kept thesame as implemented for the planar Si substrates. A compar-ison of the HfO2 film thickness on the side walls and planarareas of the nanostructures shows that the HfO2 films had aconformality of 79% and 72.2% for aspect ratios of 3 and7.3, respectively.
