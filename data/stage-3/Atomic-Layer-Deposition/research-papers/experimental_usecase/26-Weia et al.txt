Supporting InformationABSTRACT: Cesium iodide (CsI) is a well-established scintillator material thatalso serves as a precursor for all-inorganic halide perovskite solar absorbers, such asCsPbI3. However, the lack of conformal and scalable methods to deposit halideperovskite thin films remains a major challenge on their way to commercialization.In this work, we employ atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the key method due toits inherent scalability to large areas and complex-shaped surfaces. We demonstratetwo new ALD processes for the deposition of CsI and CsPbI3 thin films. The CsIprocess relies on cesium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide (Cs(btsa)) and tin(IV) iodide(SnI4) as precursors and yields high-purity, uniform, and phase-pure thin films.This process works in a wide temperature range (140?350 °C) and exhibits a largegrowth per cycle value (GPC) of 3.3 Å (85% of a CsI monolayer). Furthermore, we convert CsI into CsPbI3 perovskite by exposinga CsI film to our earlier PbI2 ALD process. We demonstrate the deposition of phase-pure ?- or ?-CsPbI3 perovskite thin films,depending on the applied deposition temperature and number of PbI2 cycles. We believe that the ALD-based approach described inthis work will offer a viable alternative for depositing perovskite thin films in applications that involve complex high aspect ratiostructures or large substrate areas.? INTRODUCTIONCesium iodide (CsI) is one of the most studied and usedscintillator materials. Due to its exceptionally high detectivequantum efficiency (DQE), CsI is mainly used in flat-panel-based systems for indirect X-ray imaging in radiology.1,2 Theoutstanding scintillating properties of CsI are based on tworeasons: Its band gap, located in the UV region (5.42 eV),3 andits columnar crystal growth, channeling light in the forwarddirection.4 For these reasons, CsI detectors reach DQE valuesas high as 65%, which is three times higher compared to otherdetector materials such as powder phosphors.5 Moreover, CsIoffers further applications, such as in photocathodes6 and aspart of the electron transport layer in organic solar cells.7CsI thin films are also precursors to some halide perovskitesthat are used in another important application: perovskite solarcells (PSCs).8 CsI thin films can be converted with Pb halidesand Sn halides to ternary absorber materials, such as CsPbI3,9CsSnI3,10,11 and Cs2SnI6.12In the past decade, researchers have delved into thepromising new field of PSCs because of their potential todeliver low-cost solar energy.13 Most recently, PSCs reached apower conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5%14,15 and thereforecatch up to the PCE of Si-based solar cells that is around26%.16 However, there is a bottleneck of two yet unsolvedchallenges: First, perovskite thin-film solar cells larger than 10× 10 cm2 remain difficult to manufacture by conventionalfabrication methods like spin-coating17 without sacrificing thefilm quality. The second unsolved issue lies within the ternaryperovskite absorber layer itself, particularly the most studiedand employed methyl ammonium lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3(MAPI).18 Although perovskites exhibit exceptional optoelec-tronic properties that are crucial for solar applications, theysuffer from high sensitivity to humidity, temperature, and lightin ambient conditions that leads to degradation of thecompound.19?24 Research has been conducted to addressthese issues, e.g., by encapsulation, new synthesis routes, andtuning of the perovskite structure by including additives, butno ultimate solution has been found yet.25?30Our approach to tackle the scalability issue relies on atomiclayer deposition (ALD). ALD is a highly controllable methodfor depositing thin films on large areas and complex-shapedsurfaces. It provides uniform and conformal film growth withan accurate control over film thickness and composition.31?33On the downside, ALD is considered to be rather slow andexpensive compared to other thin-film techniques. However,its excellent scalability to large areas and batches, oralternatively to roll-to-roll processing,34,35 enables highthroughput, which offsets its slowness. This is evidenced bythe fact that ALD has been in industrial use for decades inlarge-scale applications, such as electroluminescent displays36and microelectronics.37 In addition, ALD can be used to formReceived: April 21, 2022Revised: June 14, 2022Published: June 27, 2022Articlepubs.acs.org/cm© 2022 The Authors.

Literaturereports give evidence that perovskite solid solutions have betterstability than pure perovskites. The key to the improvedstability of solid solution perovskites is the controlled additionof several cations (HC(NH2)2+, CH3NH3+, Cs+) and/oranions (Cl?, Br?, I?) into their structure, which improvesthe stability of the perovskite against humidity and furtherincreases its photovoltaic activity.39?42 Currently, ALD lacksprocesses to deposit such perovskite solid solutions. Despitethe availability of an enormous library of ALD processes,43only one metal iodide process exists?the PbI2 process that wedeveloped previously.44 PbI2 films from this process can beconverted to MAPI perovskite upon gas treatment. Developingan ALD process for CsI and combining it with the PbI2 processto deposit CsPbI3 would be the first step toward depositingsolid solution perovskites with ALD from CsPbI3 with MAPI.First, to develop an ALD process for CsI, we tried to applychemistry similar to the one that is used in ALD of some metalfluorides. In these fluoride processes, metal ?-diketonates act asthe metal precursors and volatile metal fluorides, such asTiF445 or TaF5,46 act as the fluoride precursors. A ligandexchange between the precursors yields the desired metalfluoride. Analogously, when a volatile metal iodide is usedinstead of fluoride, the ligand exchange would yield metaliodide. For ALD of CsI, we used commercially available2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato cesium (Cs(thd)) asthe cesium precursor and titanium(IV) iodide (TiI4) ortin(IV) iodide (SnI4) as iodine precursors. These precursorcombinations yielded crystalline CsI at deposition temper-atures of 250?350 °C. However, only films that hadthicknesses exceeding 400 nm were continuous whereasthinner films had pinholes and gaps in them (Figure S1).Disappointed by this outcome, we hypothesized that lowerdeposition temperatures would decrease agglomeration andthinner continuous films could be made. However, lowerdeposition temperatures required a different, more volatile Csprecursor.In this work, we report a new ALD CsI process that relies oncesium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide47 (Cs(btsa)) as the cesiumprecursor and tin(IV) iodide (SnI4) as the iodine precursor.The high volatility of Cs(btsa) enables deposition of phase-pure, uniform, and high-purity CsI thin films at low (>140 °C)temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the deposition ofternary CsPbI3 perovskite thin films with a two-step approach:First, we deposit a CsI thin film via ALD. In the second step,by applying our earlier PbI2 ALD process on top of CsI, thefilm is converted into CsPbI3 perovskite thin film. Thiscombination of CsI and PbI2 ALD allows us to prepare phase-pure ?-CsPbI3 and ?-CsPbI3 thin films.? RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFilm Deposition. We explored CsI film deposition withCs(btsa) (Figure 1a) and SnI4 as precursors in the 140?350°C temperature range (Figure 1b). The lowest depositiontemperature was limited by the evaporation temperature ofCs(btsa). Although CsI deposition was still possible attemperatures up to 350 °C, partial Cs(btsa) precursordecomposition was observed at temperatures > 300 °C fromFigure 1. (a) Cesium precursor used in this work (Cs(btsa)). (b) Growth per cycle value (GPC) of CsI films on silicon as a function of depositiontemperature, deposited with 300 cycles and pulse durations of 1.5 and 0.5 s for Cs(btsa) and SnI4, respectively, and 1.0 s purge durations.

Mater. 2022, 34, 6087?60976088a residue built up at the hot end of the precursor delivery tube.In the temperature region between 150 and 170 °C, thegrowth per cycle value (GPC) was 3.3 Å and was found to beindependent of the deposition temperature (so-called ALDwindow32). The exceptionally high GPC (85% of onemonolayer) results from several factors. First, the monolayerof CsI has a relatively large thickness (3.87 Å) because of thelarge ionic radii of Cs (rion,Cs = 1.81 Å) and I (rion,I = 2.06 Å).Second, the chemistry used for CsI deposition, namely, theuse of a metal halide as an iodine precursor, enables depositionof up to two monolayers during one ALD cycle. This doublemonolayer-type growth is a typical phenomenon in ALDprocesses of metal fluorides that use TiF4 or TaF5 as fluorideprecursors and that also demonstrate exceptionally highGPC.45,48?50 For reference, GPC of some metal fluorideALD processes are tabulated in Table S1.45,46,48?53 In thedouble monolayer-type growth when the precursor is pulsed, itreacts with the second precursor adsorbed on the surface andthe desired material is deposited just like in normal monolayer-type growth. The key difference is that during that same pulse,the excess precursor also adsorbs on the surface of the newlyformed material. Both precursors behave this way, and thedeposition takes place every half-cycle leading to thetheoretical maximum of two monolayers per cycle for suchprocesses.For a detailed study on the influence of the processparameters, we chose the deposition temperature of 150 °C. Atthis deposition temperature, the GPC saturates with respect toboth precursor pulse durations and is independent of the purgedurations (Figure 1d?f). As optimal parameters for furtherdepositions, we chose 1.5 and 0.5 s pulse durations forCs(btsa) and SnI4, respectively, as well as 1.0 s purgedurations. With these parameters, the thickness dependedlinearly on the number of applied deposition cycles (Figure1c). These results are consistent with the behavior typicallyobserved in ALD.Film Properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements ofCsI films confirm that our process produces crystalline andphase-pure CsI thin films in the whole temperature range(Figure 2c).Examination by cross-sectional field-emission scanningelectron microscopy (FESEM) shows that the films consistof columnar crystallites (Figure 2a). Because scintillatorapplications usually require film thicknesses up to severalmicrometers,54,55 we demonstrate a deposition of 1.1-?m-thickCsI film in 3.6 h. Thanks to the high GPC of this process?asmentioned above?ALD offers a new and attractive fabricationroute for this material. Top-down SEM images show that atdeposition temperatures below 180 °C, films are continuous,uniform, and pinhole-free (Figure 2b). As the depositionFigure 2.

Mater. 2022, 34, 6087?60976089temperature increases to 180 °C and above, the GPC dropsand films deposited with the same number of cycles start tobecome thinner and discontinuous. SEM images reveal theappearance of pinholes in these films. Film roughnessmeasured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) reflects thechanges occurring in the film morphology (Figure 2d,e). At150 °C, the films are relatively smooth (Rq = 8.6 nm). As thedeposition temperature increases toward 180 °C, the rough-ness gradually increases due to larger growth of grains. Atdeposition temperatures ? 180 °C, pinholes and filmdiscontinuity cause an even larger increase of the roughness.Characterization of film composition with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and time-of-flight elastic recoildetection analysis (TOF-ERDA) showed that the films arestoichiometric CsI (Table 1). Assessing the concentrations ofall elements of interest required a combination of the twomethods. For Cs, Sn, and I contents, we relied on EDS becausethe masses of these elements were too close to resolve theirindividual concentrations from the TOF-ERDA data. No Snwas observed with EDS, and the Cs to I ratios were close to1:1. TOF-ERDA, in turn, provided light element concen-trations. There was a small amount (<5 atom %) of lightelement impurity in the films. Most notably, oxygen waspresent even though the precursors are oxygen-free. CsI isknown to be hygroscopic.56?58 Although we stored the films ineither dry or inert conditions, they were still exposed toambient air during transfer and sample preparation. CsHCO3reflections appeared in the XRD pattern of the film stored inambient air for more than a month (Figure S3). Uponexposure to ambient air, CsI films react with CO2 and H2O toproduce CsHCO3 (eq 1). Gradual reaction of CsI intoCsHCO3 in ambient air accounts for the H, C, and Oimpurities in the films and the decrease in the I content.Heating the reacted film in an inert atmosphere does notrestore its original state because of the partial loss of iodine inthe reaction (Figure S4).+ + ? +CsI(s) CO (g) H O(g) CsHCO (s) HI(g)2 2 3(1)The optical properties of the ALD CsI films are in goodagreement with those reported in the literature. The films aretransparent in the visible range (Figure 3a) and absorb in theUV range. We attribute this absorption to the band gapabsorption of CsI. The band gap, extracted from the Taucplot3,59,60 (Figure 3b) is 5.49 eV (lit. 5.43 eV61) and therefractive index is 1.80 (? = 580 nm) (lit. 1.78 at ? = 579nm).62Capacitance measurements of ALD CsI thin films resulted ina dielectric constant of 6.8. This is close to the dielectricconstant for bulk CsI (6.3) reported in the literature.63Deposition of CsPbI3. We prepared CsPbI3 films bydepositing PbI2 with ALD on top of CsI films. The supercycleapproach, a common way to deposit ternary compounds withALD, was inapplicable in our case. The supercycle approachTable 1.

Mater. 2022, 34, 6087?60976090relies on alternating deposition cycles of the binaryconstituents of the desired ternary compound. Therefore, itrequires a temperature at which both binary constituentprocesses work.In the PbI2 ALD process, deposition on Si occurs attemperatures below 90 °C and Pb precursor decompositionstarts near 150 °C. Because CsI deposition occurs at 140 °Cand above, there is no temperature that can be exploited forCsPbI3 deposition with the supercycle approach. Furthermore,in our previous work,64 we observed that in our ALD reactors,PbI2 films sublime at temperatures above 100 °C. Hence, theonly remaining pathway to deposit CsPbI3 films with these twoprocesses was the two-step approach where PbI2 is depositedon top of a CsI film.Our two-step approach had potential conceptual challengesas well. In essence, it is a solid-solid reaction that would yieldstoichiometric CsPbI3 only when the amounts of CsI and PbI2films are equal (eq 2). This would require knowledge of theGPC of PbI2 on CsI. But if PbI2, after being formed,immediately reacts with CsI, then estimating the PbI2 GPCwould be difficult. For this reason, instead of attempting toestimate the GPC of PbI2 and trying to hit the specific amountof substance that would yield stoichiometric CsPbI3, weperformed a series of depositions with different numbers ofFigure 4. (a) Contour plot of XRD patterns measured from CsI films on which PbI2 was deposited with different number of cycles at 75 °C.

The pulse durations were 1.5 s for Cs(btsa) and 1.0 s for SnI4 and purge durations were 1.0 s. In the PbI2 deposition, the durations of theprecursor pulses were 0.8 and 2.0 s for Pb(btsa)2 and SnI4, respectively, whereas purge durations were 1.0 s.Chemistry of Materials pubs.acs.org/cm Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c01202Chem. Mater. 2022, 34, 6087?60976091PbI2 deposition cycles. This experimental series also allows usto observe what happens if the amount of PbI2 deposited isinsufficient or is in excess. We exploited XRD to study thechanges in the phase composition.+ ?CsI PbI CsPbI2 3 (2)At 75 °C, the optimal temperature for the ALD PbI2process,44 the depositions failed to produce phase-pureCsPbI3 perovskite (Figure 4a,b). Perovskite phase (?) ofCsPbI3 does form when insufficient amount (500 cycles) ofPbI2 is deposited, but the conversion is not complete andunreacted CsI is still present. Depositing more PbI2 causes theformation of ?-CsPbI3, a nonperovskite phase. The ?-phasereplaces the perovskite ?-phase as more PbI2 is deposited.However, conversion does not proceed to completion: PbI2starts to accumulate as a separate phase whereas CsI and ?-CsPbI3 remain almost unchanged. Such a film stack, thatcontains unreacted PbI2, CsI, and ?-CsPbI3 can still beconverted into phase-pure ?-CsPbI3 by annealing undernitrogen at ? 325 °C (Figure 4c). However, we weredissatisfied with this outcome as it introduces an extra non-ALD step and significantly increases the highest processingtemperature used.Increasing the PbI2 deposition temperature to 100 °Cenables preparation of phase-pure perovskite ?-CsPbI3 films aswell as phase-pure nonperovskite ?-CsPbI3 films (Figure 4d).Although PbI2 does not grow on typical substrates (silicon,glass etc.) at temperatures above 90 °C and even sublimes athigher temperatures, we hypothesized that the case might bedifferent if metal halides are used as substrates. Indeed, in aspin-off experiment, we were able to deposit PbI2 at 100 °C onALD LiF52 and AlF3 films50 (Figure S5). These fluorides donot react with PbI2, but CsI on the other hand can convert intoCsPbI3 (eq 2). The conversion reaction can immediatelyconsume PbI2 deposited on CsI, and thus the stability of PbI2becomes irrelevant. Indeed, PbI2 deposition on CsI at 100 °Ccauses the formation of CsPbI3. Three thousand cycles of PbI2yield a ?-CsPbI3 film, whereas 4000 cycles yield a ?-CsPbI3 film(Figure 4e,f).Formation of CsPbI3 occurs via ALD of PbI2 followed by asolid-solid reaction with CsI (eq 2) rather than a directreaction of the PbI2 precursors with CsI. No CsPbI3 formswhen CsI is exposed to either Pb(btsa)2 or SnI4 at 100 °C(Figure S6). EDS composition analysis shows that with theincreasing number of PbI2 deposition cycles, lead and iodineconcentrations increase, whereas the cesium concentrationdecreases (Figure S7a). The changes continue until 3000 PbI2cycles. At this cycle number, the element concentrationscorrespond to CsPbI3 stoichiometry. The film compositionremains constant if the number of PbI2 deposition cycles isFigure 5. Panels (a), (c), (e), (g), and (i) show top-down SEM images of samples where PbI2 was deposited on top of the CsI film. Panels (b), (d),(f), (h), and (j) show cross-sectional SEM images of the same samples. Panel (k) shows a cross-sectional FESEM image of a hole with 10:1 AR in apatterned Si substrate. Similar to the other samples, also on this sample, CsI film was deposited first, followed by PbI2 deposition. CsI films (100nm) were deposited at 150 °C with 300 cycles. The pulse durations were 1.5 s for Cs(btsa) and 1.0 s for SnI4 and purge durations were 1.0 s. In thePbI2 deposition, the durations of the precursor pulses were 0.8 and 2.0 s for Pb(btsa)2 and SnI4, respectively, whereas purge durations were 1.0 s.Chemistry of Materials pubs.acs.org/cm Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c01202Chem. Mater. 2022, 34, 6087?60976092further increased. The EDS results are in excellent agreementwith the XRD data (Figure 4). The composition isindependent of the PbI2 precursor pulse and purge durations,provided they are long enough. Too short pulse or purge timescause incomplete conversion (Figure S7b?d).We also explored other deposition temperatures for PbI2 inthe 75?130 °C range. These experiments, performed with3000 PbI2 cycles, produced only perovskite ?-CsPbI3 at 100 °C(Figure S8). Films prepared at temperatures higher than 100°C consisted of both ?- and ?-CsPbI3 phases, with ?-phasebeing the dominant one. However, it is possible that ?-CsPbI3films can be prepared at those temperatures as well, byoptimizing the amount of PbI2 deposited, as was the case at100 °C (Figure 4e).PbI2 deposition onto CsI films drastically changes theirmorphology. At 75 °C after 500 cycles of PbI2, a layer ofCsPbI3 forms on top of the CsI film and scattered flakes ofPbI2 appear on the surface (Figure 5a,b). After 3000 cycles,when viewed top-down, the film resembles a PbI2 film wherePbI2 flakes form a continuous porous network. However, thecross section reveals a denser CsPbI3 layer underneath the PbI2network and unreacted columnar grains of CsI below CsPbI3(Figure 5c,d). In contrast to the experiments at 75 °C, no PbI2flakes are present at 100 °C after 500 cycles and only a toplayer of CsPbI3 and unreacted CsI are visible (Figure 5e,f).With more PbI2 cycles (3000 and 4000), the conversionconsumes all of the remaining CsI and the films solely consistof CsPbI3 (Figure 5g?j). The above observations are inexcellent agreement with the XRD data (Figure 4).We can conclude that at 100 °C, the conversion reaction isself-directing to the stoichiometric CsPbI3 composition. Onlythe required amount of PbI2 needed for the ternary phaseformation is deposited, while all of the excess is sublimed away.As evident from the cross-sectional SEM images (Figure 5),the thickness of the film increases when CsI reacts with PbI2(eq 2). The ratio between the thicknesses of fully convertedCsPbI3 and the original CsI can be derived from the amount ofsubstance ratios in the reaction equation and expressions fordensity, volume, and amount of substance (eq 3, where d isfilm thickness; for derivation, see Section S1). Equation 3becomes d? = 2.49 dCsI and d? = 2.33 dCsI for ?- and ?-CsPbI3,respectively.??=d dMMCsPbICsI CsPbICsPbI CsICsI333 (3)The conformality advantage of ALD is retained in ourapproach for depositing CsPbI3. Without any processparameter optimizations, we were able to deposit a CsPbI3film with a good conformality in holes with 10:1 aspect ratio(AR) (Figure 5k).Similar to the results on planar substrates, 3000 PbI2 cycleson a patterned substrate coated with 100 nm CsI film yielded?-CsPbI3 (Figure S9). EDS mapping of the patterned substratecross section shows uniform element distribution through thecoating in the structure (Figure S10).The optical properties of our CsPbI3 films are in line withthe literature. The transmittance of CsPbI3 films differsradically from the transmittance of CsI films (Figure 6a),which is also reflected in the visual appearance of the films(Figure 6b). Deposition of 3000 cycles of PbI2 on CsI resultsin a dark red-brown film with an optical band gap of 1.72 eV(Figure S11a) whereas deposition of 4000 PbI2 cycles resultsin a light lime-yellow film with a band gap of 2.85 eV (FigureS11b). These colors and band gap values are typical for the ?-and ?-CsPbI3 phases, respectively.65? CONCLUSIONSTo conclude, we described two new ALD processes for thedeposition of CsI and CsPbI3 thin films. The use of Cs(btsa)and SnI4 as precursors yielded phase-pure, uniform, and high-purity CsI thin films in a large deposition temperature range(140?350 °C). The large growth per cycle value (3.3 Å) ofthis ALD process allows deposition of thicker films in themicrometer range with a reasonable number of depositioncycles. While CsI is a well-established scintillator material forX-ray detector applications, we also demonstrated itsconversion into halide perovskite by combining it with ourearlier PbI2 ALD process. At 75 °C, incomplete conversionresulted in a stack of CsI, ?-CsPbI3 (nonperovskite phase), andPbI2 films; however, annealing under nitrogen at ?325 °Cyielded ?-CsPbI3 (perovskite phase). At 100 °C, completeconversion took place and formed phase-pure ?- or ?-CsPbI3thin films depending on the number of PbI2 deposition cycles.We believe that the ALD-based approach described in thisFigure 6.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONPrecursor Synthesis. Cesium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide (Cs-(btsa)) was synthesized according to Ojeda-Amador et al.47 byemploying Schlenk line techniques using lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (Li(btsa), 97%, Aldrich) and cesium fluoride (CsF, 99.9%,Aldrich). In short, Li(btsa) dissolved in n-hexane was added dropwiseto CsF in n-hexane over a water bath at 50 °C and left to stirovernight with protection from ambient light. Afterward, the solventwas removed under vacuum and toluene was added. The reactionmixture was filtered and the precipitate was washed with toluene.After removal of the solvent by vacuum, the resulting white productwas purified by sublimation to yield white crystals. 1H NMR (400.144MHz, 298 K, C6D6): ? 0.25 (s, 18 H).13C NMR (100.616 MHz, 298K, C6D6): ? 7.30.Pb(btsa)2 was synthesized by employing Schlenk line techniquesusing PbCl2 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and Li(btsa) (97%, Aldrich), asdescribed in our previous work.44,66 Li(btsa) dissolved in tetrahy-drofuran (THF) was added dropwise to PbCl2 in THF over a coldwater bath and left to stir overnight with protection from ambientlight. THF was removed under vacuum and hexane was added. Thereaction mixture was filtered. Hexane was removed from the filteredsolution under vacuum over a warm water bath (45 °C), whichyielded a red-orange oil. The oil was purified by sublimation undervacuum and the distillate was cooled with liquid nitrogen, whichyielded a bright yellow solid that does not melt at room temperature(RT). 1H NMR (400.144 MHz, 298 K, C6D6): ? 0.25 (s, 36 H).13CNMR (100.616 MHz, 298 K, C6D6): ? 5.93.Film Deposition. Thin films were grown in a commercial cross-flow F-120 ALD reactor (ASM Microchemistry Ltd., Finland) underreduced nitrogen pressure (99.999%, AGA, about 10 mbar) atdifferent temperatures. Nitrogen was used as a carrier and purging gasand led into the reactor through a gas purifier (SAES Pure Gas, MC1-902F, H2O, O2, CO, CO2, H2, NMHC removal < 1 ppb). Precursorpulsing was realized by inert gas valving. CsI depositions were carriedout using solid tin(IV) iodide (SnI4, >99%, ?10 mesh, ACROSOrganics) and the synthesized solid Cs(btsa) as precursors. Cs(btsa)and SnI4 precursors were sublimed from open quartz boats held insidethe reactor at 140 and 75 °C, respectively. For the PbI2 depositions,the precursor source temperatures were 50 and 62 °C for Pb(btsa)2and SnI4, respectively. Some depositions, described in Figure S1, weremade with Cs(thd) (STREM) and TiI4 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) sublimedat 225 and 105 °C, respectively.Primarily native oxide-covered 5 × 5 cm2 silicon (100) (Si,Okmetic) was used as a substrate for CsI depositions. Additionally, forsome depositions, sapphire wafers (2?, University Wafer) and tin-doped indium oxide-covered glass (ITO, Glastron) were used assubstrates. Sapphire wafers were heated at 1000 °C in an air oven for2 h to induce atomic step formation.67,68 Prior to deposition, allsubstrates except sapphire were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath, first in asolution of industrial strength cleaning concentrate (Branson) for 20min at 50 °C, then in H2O for 10 min at RT, and finally inisopropanol for 10 min at RT. Cleaned substrates were dried in anoven at 100 °C and blown with N2.Film Characterization. Surface morp
