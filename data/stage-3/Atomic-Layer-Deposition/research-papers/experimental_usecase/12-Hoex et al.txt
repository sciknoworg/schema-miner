Box 513, 5600 MBEindhoven, The NetherlandsReceived 19 April 2006; accepted 9 June 2006; published online 27 July 2006Excellent surface passivation of c-Si has been achieved by Al2O3 films prepared by plasma-assistedatomic layer deposition, yielding effective surface recombination velocities of 2 and 13 cm/s onlow resistivity n- and p-type c-Si, respectively. These results obtained for 30 nm thick Al2O3 filmsare comparable to state-of-the-art results when employing thermal oxide as used in record-efficiencyc-Si solar cells. A 7 nm thin Al2O3 film still yields an effective surface recombination velocity of5 cm/s on n-type silicon. © 2006 American Institute of Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2240736Surface passivation of crystalline silicon c-Si is of keyimportance for the performance of high efficiency industrialsolar cells. The surface to volume ratio is increasing due tothe cost-driven reduction of the solar cell thickness, whichmakes surface passivation a decisive factor for the final solarcell efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitridea-SiNx :H is routinely applied in solar cell production as anantireflection coating on the front side and provides goodsurface passivation of low resistivity n- and p-type c-Si.However, the surface passivation of a-SiNx :H on highlydoped p-type silicon e.g., p-type emitters is rather poor.When a-SiNx :H is applied on the back of a p-type solar cellthe high positive built-in charge induces a parasitic junction,limiting the solar cell efficiency.1 Thermally grown oxide isthe state-of-the-art surface passivation layer for n- andp-type c-Si of arbitrary doping level and is used in therecord-efficiency passivated emitter and rear localy-diffusedPERL c-Si solar cell.2 The surface passivation of the as-grown thermal oxide is moderate, but is significantly im-proved by a subsequent annealing in a forming gas H2 inN2. The best results are obtained by the so-called alnealscheme, where a sacrificial layer of Al is evaporated on thefilm prior to annealing. The oxidation of the Al film duringthe annealing releases atomic hydrogen that strongly reducesthe number of interface defect states. However, the high pro-cessing temperatures 9501100 °C and elaborate pro-cessing necessary to obtain such a high quality thermal oxideare not always desirable. Therefore considerable effort is putin the development of low temperature surface passivationschemes that do not show the limitations of thermal oxideand a-SiNx :H. Materials such as amorphous silicon carbidea-SiCx :H and hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-Si:Hhave recently demonstrated a good level of surface passiva-tion on both n- and p-type c-Si.35 However, both materialshave significant absorption in the visible part of the solarspectrum. These films are also thermally unstable; hence,only steps with a low thermal budget can be used after depo-sition of these films.Another interesting option is the use of the high band-gap dielectric Al2O3 as a surface passivation layer.

Redistribution subject tovisible part of the solar spectrum, Al2O3 is well suited toimprove the optical quality at the front or the back of thesolar cell. Hezel and Jaeger already demonstrated that Al2O3grown by the pyrolysis of aluminium-tri-isopropoxide canshow a reasonable level of surface passivation.6 More re-cently, Agostinelli et al. have shown that Al2O3 films grownby thermal atomic layer deposition provide a good level ofsurface passivation on p-type c-Si.7In this letter we will show that ultrathin films of Al2O3exhibit a similar level of surface passivation as alnealed ther-mal silicon oxide on both n- and p-type silicon. These filmswere prepared by plasma-assisted atomic layer depositionPA-ALD allowing monolayer growth control of high qual-ity thin films, while the plasma step enables the use of rela-tively short purging times and low deposition temperatures.Al2O3 films with a thickness of 730 nm were grown ina homebuilt PA-ALD reactor at a substrate temperature of200 °C.8 The films were prepared by alternating trimethyla-luminium exposure and a remote O2 plasma with a totalcycle time of 30 s. The film growth was monitored bymeans of in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry 2501000 nmrange and revealed a growth rate in the 1.2 Å range percycle. The atomic composition of the films was determinedby means of Rutherford backscattering RBS and elastic re-coil detection ERD. The films were oxygen rich Al:O=2:3.14, and a small amount of hydrogen 3 at. %  wasdetected in the films. The carbon content was below the de-tection limit of RBS 2 at. % . The surface passivationwas tested by depositing identical Al2O3 films on both sidesof low resistivity p-type 300 m, 111, 2.0  cm andn-type 275 m, 100, 1.9  cm float zone c-Si substrates.The substrates received a standard RCA clean with a finalHF dip prior to deposition to remove the native oxide. Afterdeposition, the lifetime samples were annealed in a N2 envi-ronment for 30 min at 425 °C in a rapid thermal annealingfurnace. The effective lifetime eff was measured using alifetime tester Sinton WCT-100 in both the quasi-steady-state and transient mode.9 The level of surface passivation isquantified by the effective surface recombination velocity.Assuming an infinite bulk lifetime, the upper limit of theeffective surface recombination velocity Seff can be calcu-lated by© 2006 American Institute of Physics2-1 AIP license or copyright, see http://apl.aip.org/apl/copyright.jsp042112-2 Hoex et al.

The postdepo-sition annealing was necessary to obtain the reported effec-tive lifetimes, as the effective lifetime of the samples withthe as-deposited Al2O3 films was only in the range of28 s. Effective lifetimes up to 1.2 ms were measured fora p-type substrate passivated by 30 nm Al2O3 film corre-sponding to a Seff13 cm/s. No difference in effective life-time is observed when a 15 nm Al2O3 film is used instead ofa 30 nm Al2O3 film, except for the behavior for lower injec-tion levels.The surface passivation of Al2O3 was also tested onn-type c-Si. In Fig. 2 the effective lifetime for 1.9  cmn-type silicon passivated by 7, 14, and 26 nm Al2O3 isshown. A maximum lifetime of 6.6 ms was measured for ann-type substrate passivated by a 26 nm Al2O3 film corre-sponding to a Seff2 cm/s. For Al2O3 film thicknesses of 7and 15 nm comparable results were obtained and effectivelifetimes up to 3.0 ms were measured, corresponding to aSeff5 cm/s.The postdeposition annealing was essential for a goodlevel of surface passivation; however, from RBS/ERD noFIG. 1.

Effective lifetime as a function of the excess carrier density for lowresistivity n-type 275 m, 100, 1.9  cm float zone c-Si substrate pas-sivated with 30, 15, and 7 nm thick Al2O3 films.Downloaded 14 Sep 2007 to 131.155.108.71. Redistribution subject tosignificant changes could be detected in the atomic compo-sition of the annealed Al2O3 films. From high resolutiontransmission electron microscopy HR-TEM it was foundthat both the as-deposited and annealed Al2O3 films areamorphous in composition, as shown in Fig. 3 for the an-nealed film. An interfacial oxide layer of 1.5 nm 1.2 nmprior to anneal is present between the c-Si and Al2O3 as aresult of the deposition process, possibly from the exposureof the substrate to the O2 plasma in the first ALD cycles. Ina separate experiment it was verified that the oxide layerformed during the O2 plasma exposure in itself does notyield any surface passivation, also not after annealing.The effective lifetimes measured for a p-type c-Si sub-strate passivated by a 15 nm Al2O3 film in this study aresignificantly higher compared to the results reported for sub-strates passivated by a-SiCx :H films or Al2O3 films grownby thermal ALD.4,7 The results are comparable to the bestresults obtained for alnealed thermal SiO2 and nearly stoichi-ometeric a-SiNx :H and approach the results obtained fora-Si:H.3,1012 It should be noted that the reported literaturevalues were obtained for films with thicknesses in the rangeof 20100 nm and that the level of surface passivation ofa-SiCx :H and a-SiNx :H is reported to deteriorate for filmswith thicknesses below 40 and 20 nm, respectively.13,14 Onthe other hand, the effective lifetimes for n-type c-Si passi-vated with a 26 nm Al2O3 film are comparable to the bestresults obtained for alnealed thermal SiO2, a-SiNx :H, anda-Si:H films and significantly higher than reported fora-SiCx :H films.3,5,10,11All lifetime curves in Figs. 1 and 2 show the expecteddecrease in effective lifetime at higher injection levels due toAuger recombination. For the p-type wafer in Fig. 1 passi-vated with a 30 nm Al2O3, the effective lifetime shows thetypical injection level dependence also reported for p-typewafers passivated by a-SiNx :H, a-SiCx :H, or thermaloxide,4,10,11 probably caused by Shockley-Read-Hall SRHrecombination in the bulk or at the surface through a midgapdefect.15,16 Remarkably, the lifetime curve for the p-type wa-fer passivated by a 15 nm film is constant for lower injectionlevel. For the n-type wafers passivated by 726 nm Al2O3,the effective lifetime slightly decreases for lower injectionFIG. 3.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 042112 2006vated by a-SiCx :H and a-Si:H.3,5 This decrease can again beattributed to SRH recombination in the bulk or at the surface.The excellent surface passivation by the Al2O3 film ismainly determined by the field effect passivation due to alarge 1013 cm?2 built-in negative charge as indicated byC-V measurements. This negative built-in charge for Al2O3was also reported by Hezel and Jaeger6 and Agostinelli etal.7 The negative charge in Al2O3 is suggested to be presentat the unique tetrahedrally coordinated Al site present at theinterface that has a net negative charge, in contrast to theoctahedrally coordination site where Al has a charge of 3+.17For the commonly used thermal oxide and a-SiN:H positivebuilt-in charges in the range of 10101012 cm?2 arereported,6,18 and for a-SiC:H the sign of the built-in chargeis reported to depend on the wafer doping type.4,5 A negativebuilt-in charge is especially beneficial for passivation ofhighly doped p-type silicon.The fact that the high level of surface passivation couldonly be obtained by a postdeposition annealing of the Al2O3films deposited at 200 °C could be caused by a local re-construction of the Al2O3 at the interface, consequently in-creasing the negative built-in charge.19 In addition, hydrogenfrom the Al2O3 bulk could diffuse and provide chemical pas-sivation at the c-Si/Al2O3 interface, thereby reducing defectrelated recombination. A factor of 10 reduction of the inter-face defect density was reported for a metal-insulator-semiconductor structure with Al2O3 as the insulator after a15 min annealing at 500 °C.6In conclusion, we have shown that excellent surface pas-sivation, similar to alnealed thermal oxide, can be obtainedon n- and p-type c-Si by thin Al2O3 films prepared by thePA-ALD technique. An ultrathin film of 7 nm thick Al2O3yields a Seff5 cm/s on n-type c-Si. By optimization pro-cess, cycle times could be reduced to a sub second leveland the total process, growth, and annealing would be sig-nificantly faster compared to the state-of-the-art passivationschemes applied presently.The authors thank M.
