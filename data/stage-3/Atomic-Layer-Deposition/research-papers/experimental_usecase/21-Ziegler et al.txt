The stoichiom-etry of the of the over-stoichiometric MoOx films can beadjusted by the plasma-parameters. First results of theselayers acting as hole-selective contacts in silicon hetero-junction (SHJ) solar cells are presented and discussed.1 IntroductionIts spectrally broad transparency and high work functionmakes evaporated molybdenum oxide (MoOx ) a promis-ing candidate for substituting amorphous silicon emitterin silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells [1]. Thus thereplacement of the p-doped amorphous silicon emitterby higher band gap materials like MoOx can lead to again in the photo current of such cells[2][3]. However, athin intrinsic amorphous silicon((i)a-Si:H) layer betweenthe oxide and the crystalline silicon (c-Si) is still neededto improve the poor surface passivation quality of theoxide and to fully benefit of the MoOx -induced highopen circuit voltage (VOC) [3].Although the hole-selective conductivity mechanism throughthe MoOx /(i)a-Si:H/(n)c-Si stack is not fully under-stood in detail, it is influenced by the defect state den-sity in the MoOx as well as the MoOx layer thicknessitself[3][4].For depositing very thin (<10 nm), conformal oxides onstructured silicon surfaces atomic layer depostion (ALD)Send offprint requests to: Johannes Ziegler? e-mail: johannes.ziegler@physik.uni-halle.deis due to its reaction-limited growth process an idealcandidate[5].Thermal ALD recipes for MoOx are recentlyreported by different groups, but up to now non of theseMoOx layers are tested as emitter alternative in SHJ so-lar cells[6][7][8].In this work, we introduce an alternative new plasmaenhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) process forMoOx layers. Influences of the process conditions onthe stoichiometry of these layers,as well as there per-formance on cell level are shown.2 ExperimentalThe MoOx deposition was carried out by an PE-ALDprocess in a FlexAL ALD reactor (Oxford instruments)with inductively-coupled plasma source. Before startinga deposition the reactor chamber is pumped to a basepressure below 0.7 mPa and the substrate is heated to180?C . Due to the low vapor pressure of the used liquidMo precursor (NtBu)2(NMe2 )2Mo , the source is heatedto 50 ?C and transported to the reactor chamber by Argas (step 1). After the first precursor dose the reactorchamber is purged by Ar only (step 2), while later in thepurge step the Ar flow through the ICP source is changedto O2 to get a stable O2 flow trough the plasma source(step 3). In next step (step 4) O2 plasma is burned overthe substrate with a plasma power of 300 W. The laststep (step 5) in the cycle is done by flowing O2 throughthe ICP source for the one second (1 second O2 plasma)and the two second O2 (2 second O2 plasma) plasmaprocesses (figures: 1, 2). The minimal reactor pressureis set to 2 Pa. The upper limit of each step of the dif-ferent processes is given in the process cycle overview ofthe processes (see figures: 1, 2, 3). The PE-ALD plasma2 Johannes Ziegler et al.step duration is varied between 1 s (figure:1) and 2 s (fig-ure:2). Additionally, the influence of an Ar plasma onthe MoOx layers is tested by inserting an six second Arplasma step with 300 W plasma power (2 second O2plasma & Ar) (compare figure:3).1234 5duration one cycle 7.2 sStep max.pressure O2 flow1 C12H30N4Mo dose 12.0Pa no2 dose purge 4.0Pa no3 stabilisation 2.4Pa yes4 O2 plasma 2.0Pa yes5 plasma purge 4.4Pa yesFig. 1: Schema PE-ALD MoOx process 1 second O2plasma.1234 5duration one cycle 8.2 sStep max.pressure O2 flow1 C12H30N4Mo dose 16.0Pa no2 dose purge 4.9Pa no3 stabilisation 2.6Pa yes4 O2 plasma 2.0Pa yes5 plasma purge 6.4Pa yesFig. 2: Schema PE-ALD MoOx process 2 second O2plasma.123456duration one cycle 13.2 sStep max.pressure O2 flow1 C12H30N4Mo dose 2.7Pa no2 dose purge 2.7Pa no3 stabilisation 2.6Pa yes4 O2 plasma 2.0Pa yes5 plasma purge 5.4Pa no6 Ar plasma 2.6Pa noFig. 3: Schema PE-ALD MoOx process 2 second O2 &Ar plasma.The thicknesses and growth per cycle (GPC) of theproduced MoOx layers on silicon substrate are measuredby spectral ellipsometry using a Tauc-Lorentz model com-bined with an Gauss oscillator to model sub band gapabsorption if necessary [9]. X-ray photoelectrons spec-tra of the as deposited MoOx layers are measured bya Kratos Axis Ultra photoelectrons spectrometer (x-raysource Al EK? = 1486.7eV).For the solar cell preparation polished float-zone grownphosphorous doped (100) silicon wafers with a resistiv-ity of 1-5?cm were used. The wafers were cleaned usingthe RCA process and dipped in diluted hydrofloric acid(2 min, 1 % vol.) prior to amorphous silicon depositionsand 5 nm intrinsic amorphous silicon were deposited atthe front side of the wafers and a stack of 4 nm intrinsicand 8 nm phosphorous-doped amorphous silicon was de-posited on the back side.Amorphous silicon layers were deposited by plasma en-hanced chemical vapor deposition. The intrinsic amor-phous silicon layers were deposited using an excitationfrequency of 13.56 MHz and a power density of 20 mW/cm2.The deposition temperature was 170?C, the pressure0.5 mbar, the distance between electrode and substrateon the grounded electrode was 3 cm and the process gasconsisted of pure silane. The intrinsic layers were ex-posed to a hydrogen plasma treatment[10] in the samereactor at 1 mbar, an electrode substrate distance of 5 cmand a plasma power density of 60 mW/cm2.Phosphorous-doped amorphous silicon was grown in areactor with 60 MHz excitation, at 0.5 mbar, 195?C, withan electrode distance of 2.3 cm, at plasma power densityof 20 mW/cm2 with a gas phase doping of 2000 ppm pro-vided by mixing phosphine diluted at 1 % in hydrogenwith silane.Directly after a 1 min dip in 1 %vol.diluted Hf, to removean potential native oxide from the amorphous silicon, 10and 20 nm thick molybdenum oxide layer have been de-posited by the introduced PE-ALD processes with vary-ing plasma steps on the front side of the wafers. Follow-ing the molybdenum oxide depositions indium-tin-oxide(ITO) was sputtered onto the samples. The ITO layerswere RF-sputtered from a ceramic target at a pressure of6 mbar, a sputtering power of 70 W, a voltage of about165 V and a gas flow of 40 sccm. The sputter gas con-sisted of Argon with 0.2 % oxygen for the front side ITOand 0.5 % oxygen for the back side layer. The thicknessof the front side ITO is about 80 nm, while about 150 nmwere deposited on the back side. Since the layers weredeposited at room temperature a two minute post depo-sition anneal at 200?C was conducted.Metal contacts were applied by thermal evaporation oftitanium silver stacks. 10 nm of titanium were depositedas an adhesion layer and 500 nm of silver were added onthe back side and 1500 nm on the front side. The frontside evaporation was conducted through a shadow mask.Afterwards the solar cell area of 1 cm2 was defined byphotolithography and HCl etching of the ITO layer onthe front side.Photoconductanse decay measurements were conductedusing a Sinton Instruments system to measure the mi-nority carrier lifetime of the wafers in between differentprocess steps[11]. Bright IV of the solar cells were mea-sured using a class c sun simulator.3 Results and discussionIn figure 4 the MoOx film thickness determined by spec-tral ellipsometry, plotted over the number of performedALD cycles for the 1 second and 2 second O2 plasmaprocesses, is shown. A very similar linear increase oflayer thickness with number of cycles is found for bothMoOx for emitters 3processes. The relatively high growth rate per cycle of0.06(5)±0.008 nm for both O2 plasma durations indi-cates that oxygen saturation is reached at a plasma powerof 300 W within 1 s. This high growth rate at 180 ?C isone main benefit compared to the thermal ALD MoOxprocess reported by Bertuch et. al.[8], which use thesame Mo precursor but ozone as oxidant.For the ther-mal ALD MoOx process at temperatures below 200?Cgrowth rate per cycle below 0.03 nm are reported. ByPE-ALD the activation energy can be delivered by theoxygen reactants from O2 plasma. This enables highergrowth rates specially for lower deposition temperatures.Thegrowth rates are not significantly influenced by longerpurge times or by the integration of an additional Arplasma step in the cycle, like its done in process 2 sec-ond O2 and 6 second Ar plasma (figure:3) (not shown).0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160024681012deposition cyclesthickness(nm)2 second O21 second O2Fig. 4: MoOx thickness measured by spectral ellipsome-trie data poltted versus the number of ALD cycles.The optical parameters, estimated from the ellipsom-etry data of the different MoOx layers, are slightly af-fected by the duration of the plasma step (compare fig-ure5). While the 2 second O2 plasma process shows nosub band gap absorption the additional Argon plasmastep leads to small, wide sub band gap absorption in theMoOx layers the. For 1 second O2 plasma duration thesub band gap absorption is more pronounced and lesswide (figure5).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used toidentify the core level binding energies and oxidationstates of the MoOx layers.The spectra of the films onsilicon show characteristic peaks for the oxygen molyb-denum. Beside a small carbon peak from surface contam-ination no additional peaks can be found in the surveyspectra (not shown).In figure 6 very similar spectra forall processes can be found in the Mo 3d doublet region.Two peaks are observed at 232.5 and 235.6 eV, whichcorresponds to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 respectively.This values are consistent with reported values for the1.5 2 2.5 300.20.40.60.811.21.41.6photon energy (eV)extinktioncoefficientk2 second O22 second O2 & Ar1 second O21.61.822.22.42.6refractiveindexnFig. 5: Refractive index n and extinction coefficient k ofthe produced MoOx layer as determined from spectro-scopic ellipsometry.Mo oxidation state of 6 + in literature( 232.3 - 232.6 eVfor the Mo 3d5/2 and 235.4 - 235.7 eV for the Mo 3d3/2[4][12][8][6]).2312322332342352362372382468·104binding energy (eV)intensity(ab.units)2 second O22 second O2 & Ar1 second O2Fig. 6: XPS spectra of the Mo3d doublet of MoOx filmsgrown in PE-ALD processes with varying plasma step.A clear difference can be found in the O 1s energy re-gion in figure 7. While all measurements show a similarO 1s peak at 530.3 eV a second oxygen related peak athigher binding energies can be found in the spectra. Inthe 1 second O2 process spectrum this peak at 531.3 eVis less pronounced, compared to the spectra of 2 secondO2 processes, in which this peak is located at slightlyhigher binding energies at 531.8 eV. Choi and coauthors[12] assign a very similar peak in molybdenum oxide4 Johannes Ziegler et al.5295305315325335342468·104binding energy (eV)itensity(ab.units)2 second O22 second O2 & Ar1 second O2Fig. 7: XPS spectra of O1s energy region of MoOx filmsgrown in PE-ALD processes with varying plasma step.to strongly absorbed oxygen as O?, HO? or H2O. Al-though we can not exclude that this peak is formed byadsorbed air moisture in the layers, as samples were nottransferred in vacuo in to the spectrometer. It is verylikely that this difference are process related, in partic-ular because the samples have been produced after eachother and transfered together. It seems plausible thata longer oxygen plasma step leads to a higher contentof strongly absorbed oxygen in the MoOx layers itself.However a stoichiometry analysis of the measured XPSspectra show over-stoichiometric (x > 3) MoOx for allproduced layers. While the O to Mo proportion x = 3.15is estimated for the 1 second O2 layer, a higher oxygencontent is measured for 2 second O2 plasma processesx = 3.62 without and x = 3.55 with Ar plasma step.The performance of the different MoOx processes is testedfor 10 nm and 20 nm thick oxide layers in SHJ solar cells.The cell results (compare figure 8) show significant dif-ferences mainly in the open circuit voltage. While theoxides grown in the 2 second O2 plasma processes reachbest VOC values above 610 mV up to 650 mV, the bestVOC values reach by the oxides grown in the 1 second O2plasma processes are below 580 mV. It is worth to men-tion, that the low open circuit voltages in these cells arenot limited by enhanced surface recombination. Fromlifetime measurements of the samples after ITO sput-tering and post anneal(not shown) a quasi-Fermi levelsplitting at 1 sun (often called implied VOC ) well above700 mV could be measured for all samples. Both processwithout Ar plasma step tend to slightly lower open cir-cuit voltages for thicker oxide layer. Cells with MoOxlayers grown in a process with Ar plasma step show anopposite trend.The parasitic absorption in the thin oxides is not theonly optical loss, shadowing of the ITO itself, as well asdifferences in the reflection of the front side stacks arealso limiting the current. Therefor the cells with thin(10 nm) oxide layers show very similar currents. A loss incurrent by doubling the oxide thickness can be seen in allproduced cells. As expected the 1 s O2 plasma processedMoOx layers show the highest optical lose, by doublingthe layer thickness, above 1.3 mA cm?2. Although theextinction coefficient, determined by spectral ellipsome-try on as deposited oxide layers, are slightly higher forthe MoOx process with Ar plasma step the short cir-cuit currents do not reflect such tendencies. This couldindicate that the ITO sputtering step and the post de-position anneal determines the optical properties of theMoOx layers. The fill factors and efficiency of all cells are28293031JSC(mAcm?2)10 nm mean 10 nm best 20 nm mean 20 nm best550600650VOC(mV)2secondO22secondO2&Ar1secondO230405060FF(%)2secondO22secondO2&Ar1secondO226810?(%)Fig. 8: Solar cell results versus MoOx processes for 10 nmand 20 nm thick oxide layerslimited by differently strong pronounced s-shape in thebright IV curves(compare figures 10 and 11). Batagliaet. al. [3] have reported similar s-shape feature, morepronounced for thicker evaporate MoOx layers of SHJsolar cells with MoOx emitter. Same tendencies can befound here for cells with MoOx layers grown in PE-ALDprocess without additional Ar plasma step. One possiblereason for such shape could be the existence of a largebarrier for hole transport in SHJ solar cells with suffi-cient front surface passivation [13]. At first sight it seemsplausible to assume that an insufficient hole transportthrough the MoOx layers itself is the dominating partof such barrier in the produced cells. The decrease in fillfactor for thicker oxide layer seems to supporting thisidea. Anyhow MoOx layers grown in PE-ALD processwith additional Ar plasma step do not show such depen-dence. On the other hand the valence band offset on thea-Si:H/c-Si interface could bee the dominating part ofthe barrier, if a tunneling process of holes through thisoffset is dominating the current a wider barrier leads toa more pronounced s-shape. The wide of such barrierMoOx for emitters 5is working point dependent and directly influenced bythe band bending. A lower work-function of the MoOxwould introduce an lower dark band bending in the c-Si(see schematic sketch in figure 9).EFITOMoOx(i)a-SiSiELEVEFITOMoOx(i)a-SiSiELEVFig. 9: Sketch illustrating differences in MoOx induceddark band bending above: high work-function MoOx ,below: low work-function MoOx .Therefore a lower open circuit voltage, and as well amore pronounced s-shape can be expected. In total itleads to a significant loss in fill factor and efficiencyIt is known that work-function in sub-stoichiometric molyb-denum oxide(x < 3) decrease by the removal of oxygen[14]. Although all as deposited oxides are over-stoichiometricwe speculate that the ITO sputter step and the post de-position anneal can reduce the oxygen content in theMoOx layers during the cell process. It might be some-how plausible that after these reduction the MoOx lay-ers with initial less oxygen still have a lower content andtherefore a lower work function compared to layers withhigher initial oxygen content. Such an effect would ex-plain the high decrease in VOC and fill factor seen incells with MoOx layers grown the 1 second O2 PE-ALDprocess, with lower initial oxygen content.?0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8?30?20?1001020voltage (V)currentdensity(mAcm?2)10.6% 2 second O210.4% 2 second O2 & Ar7.3% 1 second O2Fig. 10: Bright IV-curves of SHJ cells with 10 nm MoOx.?0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8?30?20?1001020voltage (V)currentdensity(mAcm?2)9.0% 2 second O210.4% 2 second O2 & Ar5.8 % 1 second O2Fig. 11: Bright IV-curves of SHJ cells with 20 nm MoOx.4 ConclusionsA new PE-ALD process for the deposition of MoOx withhigh growth rate at temperatures below 200 ?C has beenpresented. XPS measurements show that the stoichiome-try of the grown oxides can be influenced by the durationof the oxidizing plasma step. In a first experiment the6 Johannes Ziegler et al.integration of this MoOx layers as alternative emittersin SHJ solar cells are tested with efficiencies above 10 %.A strong influence of initial stoichiometry on the opencircuit voltage and on cell performance can be reported.The best cells have a 10 nm MoOx layer and a 2 secondoxygen plasma step.Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Ker-stin Jacob and Mona Wittig for wafer cleaning.
