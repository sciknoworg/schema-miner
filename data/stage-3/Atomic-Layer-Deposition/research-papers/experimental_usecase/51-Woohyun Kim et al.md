## Abstract

The ovonic threshold switch ( OTS based on the voltage snapback of amorphous chalcogenides ) possesses several desirable characteristics: bidirectional switching, a controllable threshold voltage ( V th ) and processability for three-dimensional stackable devices. Among the materials that can be used as OTS, GeSe has a strong glass-forming ability ( ∼ 350 ° C crystallization temperature , with a simple binary composition. Described herein is a new method of depositing ) GeSe /uniFB01 lms through atomic layer deposition ( ALD , using HGeCl3 ) and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se as Ge and Se precursors, respectively. The stoichiometric GeSe thin /uniFB01 lms were formed through a ligand exchange reaction between the two precursor molecules, without the adoption of an additional reaction gas, at low substrate temperatures ranging from 70 ° C 150 -° C. The pseudo-saturation behavior required a long time of Ge precursor injection to achieve the saturation growth rate. This was due to the adverse in /uniFB02 uence of the physisorbed precursor and byproduct molecules on the ef /uniFB01 cient chemical adsorption reaction between the precursors and reaction sites. To overcome the slow saturation and excessive use of the Ge precursor, the discrete feeding method ( DFM , where HGeCl3 ) is supplied multiple times consecutively with subdivided pulse times, was adopted. DFM led to the saturation of the GeSe growth rate at a much shorter total injection time of the Ge precursor, and improved the /uniFB01 lm density and oxidation resistance properties. The GeSe /uniFB01 lm grown via DFM exhibited a short OTS time of ∼ 40 ns, a ∼ 10 7 ON OFF current ratio, / and ∼ 10 4 selectivity. The OTS behavior was consistent with the modi /uniFB01 ed Poole -Frenkel mechanism in the OFF state. In contrast, the similar GeSe /uniFB01 lm grown through the conventional ALD showed a low density and high vulnerability to oxidation, which prevented the OTS performance. The ALD method of GeSe /uniFB01 lms introduced here will contribute to the fabrication of a three-dimensionally integrated memory as a selector device for preventing sneak current.

## 1. Introduction

Phase-change random access memory ( PcRAM ) is a strong candidate for the next-generation memory, with characteristics of non-volatility, fast operating speed, and low power consumption [ 1 -5 . ] The three-dimensional- 3D -stackable ( ) memory of the crossbar array has been proposed as a promising solution to overcome the existing limitations in the memory density of the PcRAM in a 2D planar integration structure. Despite the advances in 3D structural designs to scale down the memory, sneak current, which frustrates the accurate reading / writing of data in each cell, has remained a critical issue. Selector devices like the P -N junction diodes, metal-insulator-metal diodes, and ovonic threshold switch ( OTS ) have been devised to minimize these errors in operation [ 6 . Among the options for the selector device, the OTS ] using amorphous chalcogenides has the preferable property of a bidirectional, controllable threshold voltage ( V th ) and process compatibility with chalcogenide-based phase change materials. The material properties required in OTS, however, are different from those needed in PcRAM. For the memory element, both the appropriate crystallization speed and amorphous stability are among the essential requirements since the memory operation is based on the reversible change between the crystal and amorphous phases. The pseudo-binary system of GeTe -Sb2Te3 has shown to possess the desirable properties. In the case of OTS, only the latter requirement on the amorphous stability is critical since the threshold switching is the characteristics of the amorphous phase, and no crystallization is involved for the material function as a selector.

Recent studies have shown that GeSe is one of the strongest candidates for OTS owing to its high amorphous stability ( with a crystallization temperature [ T cry ] as high as ∼ 350 ° C , ) with a simple binary composition [ 7, 8 . ] The GeSe-based OTS device is often used as a selector component in a 1-selector-1-resistor ( 1S1R ) structure for the stable operation of the crossbar arrays of random access memory. Previous studies successfully demonstrated a the 1S1R structure consisting of the stacking layers of the GeSe and resistive memory layer as a selector and memory element, respectively [ 9, 10 . ] Researchers also investigated the dependence of thermal stability and V th on the Ge concentration in Ge Se 1 x ( -x ) compounds [ 11 . ] Additionally, Sband N-doped Se-rich GeSe /uniFB01 lms have been proven to improve the performance of OTS [ 12 . Although the previous studies ] provided valuable information on the relation between the compositions and the OTS behavior, the adopted physical vapor deposition methods have limited applicability in the fabrication of 3D-stackable-matrix-integrated devices, due to their limited step coverage.

Atomic layer deposition ( ALD , ) by comparison, possesses ideal properties, such as excellent conformality for the construction of complex, high-aspect-ratio structures [ 13 . ] The authors reported several ALD cases of GeTe2 or GeTe /uniFB01 lms using Ge IV ( ) or Ge II ( ) precursors such as Ge OEt 4, ( ) Ge N Si CH3 3 2 { [ ( ) ] } 2 , and HGeCl3 [ 14 17 . In the case of the -] alkoxy-Ge precursor, non-ideal physisorption ( lack of strong chemical adsorption ) and the high oxidation state ( + 4 ) limit its use in the deposition of GeSe [ 18 . Recently, HGeCl3 ] was reported to have shown a prominent ALD behavior in the deposition of GeTe as it acted as a Ge II ( ) source without requiring an additional gas for its reaction, and no incubation cycles were involved [ 16, 17 . Despite the achievement in the ] conformal and uniform morphologies of the GeTe2 and GeTe /uniFB01 lms in previous studies, these unconventional precursors may cause complicated ALD growth behaviors due to the steric hindrance from the physisorbed molecules ( i.e., precursors, byproducts . ) Various modi /uniFB01 ed ALD methods have been suggested to be used to address this undesirable phenomenon. The discrete feeding method ( DFM has been ) shown to ef /uniFB01 ciently remove the physisorbed molecules in a HfO2 deposition by subdividing the precursor pulse and purge times [ 19 . ] It has also contributed to the improved /uniFB01 lm properties, such as a higher /uniFB01 lm density and a low impurity concentration, owing to the more /uniFB02 uent ALD reaction steps.

In this work, ALD of binary GeSe using HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ) ] 2 Se as the Ge and Se precursors, respectively, was studied. The 1:1 stoichiometry of GeSe was achieved by the ligand exchange reaction between the Se precursor and the GeCl2 produced by the decomposition of HGeCl3. DFM was introduced for the Ge deposition steps, to overcome the extended Ge pulse and purge times for the saturation of the growth rate in the conventional ALD process. The method resulted in great improvements in the saturation behavior, surface morphology, and /uniFB01 lm density. The additional effects on the chemical and amorphous phase stability were also investigated. The GeSe /uniFB01 lm grown via DFM exhibited a short OTS time of ∼ 40 ns, a ∼ 10 7 ON OFF current / ratio, and ∼ 10 4 selectivity. The OTS behavior was consistent with the modi /uniFB01 ed Poole -Frenkel ( PF ) mechanism, with the /uniFB01 tting parameters of 5.36 /uniF0A0 × /uniF0A0 10 20 cm -3 charge trap density and 1.41 /uniF0A0 × /uniF0A0 10 -7 cm inter-trap distance.

## 2. Experiment

The deposition of GeSe /uniFB01 lms was performed using a showerhead-type ALD tool with a 6 inch-wafer chamber ( CN-1, atomic-premium . ) All the ALD lines where the precursor passed were maintained at 100 ° C. The substrate temperature of the deposition stage was 70 ° C, except for the experiments that were performed to determine the effect of the temperature. The Ge and Se precursors were HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se, respectively. Each of the precursors was placed in a separate stainless steel canister. The Ge precursor was maintained at 3 ° C, and the Se precursor, at 30 ° C. The vapor pressures of HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se were approximately 30 and 2 Torr at their respective canister temperatures. Due to the high vapor pressure of HGeCl3, the pulsed amount of the Ge precursor was regulated using a manually operated metering valve, and was diluted with 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute ( sccm ) Ar gas. It was delivered through the vapor draw method rather than through the bubble-type method. On the other hand, the Se precursor was carried into the chamber by being made to pass 50 sccm Ar gas using the bubble-type method. After each

precursor injection sequence, the excess precursors and byproducts were purged out using 200 sccm Ar gas. The process recipes of the ALD sequence were designed to prevent a gas phase reaction between the precursors. The precursor sequence of the conventional ALD was determined as follows, through the ALD saturation experiments: Ge precursor pulse ( 7 s ) -purge ( 15 s ) -Se precursor pulse ( 2 s ) -purge ( 15 s . To ) con /uniFB01 rm the ALD-type saturation behavior, the process time of each step was varied while the other process time was kept constant. The recipe for ALD-DFM is Ge precursor pulse ( 1 s ) -purge ( 5 s ) -pulse ( 1 s ) -purge ( 5 s ) -pulse ( 1 s ) -purge ( 5 s ) -Se precursor ( 2 s ) -purge ( 15 s . ) In this case, the 7 s long Ge precursor pulse time was shortened to 3 s but was divided into three 1 s s, ' and the 15 s long purge time was divided into three 5 s s while the Se precursor pulse and purge ' times remained unchanged. For comparison, the conventional ALD process with 3 s long Ge precursor pulses was also tested. The reaction mechanism between HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se was similar to that of the previously reported [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Te [ 17 . The DFM, however, effectively removed the physisorbed ] molecules. Thermally oxidized 200 nm thick SiO2 / Si and TiN Ti SiO2 / / / Si were used as substrates, in which 50 and 5 nm thick TiN and Ti /uniFB01 lms, respectively, were deposited via reactive and direct-current ( DC sputtering. )

The layer densities of the deposited /uniFB01 lms were measured via x-ray /uniFB02 uorescence spectroscopy ( Thermo Scienti /uniFB01 c, Quant X EDXRF , and the growth rate was the layer density ' ) value divided by the number of cycles. A resistivity -temperature experiment was performed using the real-time resistivity -temperature measurement system ( homemade . ) Both the crystallinity and density of the /uniFB01 lms were measured with x-ray equipment ( glancing angle incidence x-ray diffraction ( GAXRD and x-ray re ) /uniFB02 ectivity ( XRR , respectively , using ) ) an x-ray diffractometer ( PANalytical, X Pert PRO MPD . The ' ) impurity level of each /uniFB01 lm was con /uniFB01 rmed via Auger electron spectroscopy ( AES, ULVAC-PHI, PHI-700 . Scanning elec-) tron microscopy ( SEM, Hitachi, S-4800 ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM, JEOL, JSPM 5200 ) were used to observe the morphology of the /uniFB01 lm surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS, UK VG, Sigma Probe ) was used to con /uniFB01 rm the chemical states of the elements in the /uniFB01 lms. The fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) image was analyzed via transmission electron microscopy ( TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F , ) using a specimen prepared with a focused ion beam ( FEI, Helios 650 . )

The OTS devices were fabricated using hole pattern substrates and while proceeding with each 100 cycles sequence of the conventional ALD process, and with the DFM process ( where the hole diameter and depth were 2 μ m and 50 nm, respectively ) formed in a SiO2 layer. The hole was /uniFB01 lled with W, which played the role of the bottom electrode. The schematic diagram of this OTS device will be shown later. A pulse generator ( Agilent, 81110 A ) and an oscilloscope ( Tektronix, TDS 684 C ) were used to observe the TS behavior of the /uniFB01 lms. The DC characteristics of the device were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. ALD behavior of GeSe films

GeSe /uniFB01 lms were deposited by ALD sequence with and without DFM using HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se. The conventional ALD process refers to the ALD without the DFM process, where Ge and Se pulse and purge were injected alternatively ( /uniFB01 gure 1 a ( )) . The ALD with DFM, by comparison, divides the total Ge pulse and purge times into several shorter times. Figure 1 b ( ) describes the ALD-DFM sequence, where the Ge purge and pulse injection was subdivided into three consecutive pulses while keeping the total injection time the same as that in the conventional ALD process.

Figure 2 shows the growth behavior of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm deposited through the conventional ALD method using HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ) ] 2 Se as Ge and Se precursors, respectively. As previously reported, HGeCl3 is known to readily decompose into GeCl2 and HCl at the relevant process temperatures. Under the adopted experiment conditions ( canister temperature: 3 ° C; ALD line temperature: 100 ° C , ) the Ge precursor is pulsed into the chamber as coexisting three molecules ( HGeCl3, GeCl2, HCl . Figure 2 a ) ( ) show two reaction mechanisms between the Ge and Se precursors during the deposition [ 17 . ]

The reactions follow mechanisms similar to the reactions between HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Te, as identi /uniFB01 ed in the previous work on the ALD deposition of the GeTe /uniFB01 lm [ 17 . ] According to the reaction mechanisms presented in /uniFB01 gure 2 a , ( ) the deposition is expected to result in the stoichiometric GeSe /uniFB01 lm, which was indeed the case, as discussed below. The saturation growth rate ( 48.1 /uniF0A0 ± /uniF0A0 1.8 ng cm -2 cy -1 ) and the 1:1 stoichiometric GeSe composition were achieved for the Ge and Se precursors ' pulse and purge times ( Ge pulse: 7 s; Ge purge: 15 s; Se pulse: 2 s; Se purge: 15 s . ) The self-limiting growth behavior revealed that ligand exchange reaction occurred on the growing surface. Compared to the short injection time of the Se precursor for the saturation growth rate ( 2 s , ) however, the Ge precursor requires a 7 s injection time to achieve the saturation growth rate ( /uniFB01 gure 2 b ( )) . This pseudo-saturation behavior is also re /uniFB02 ected in the long Ge and Se purge times ( ∼ 15 s ) for

saturation, as shown in /uniFB01 gures 2 c ( ) and ( e . This is inconsistent ) with the previous report on the ALD of GeTe, where the growth rate is saturated with a 5 s purge time [ 17 . A possible reason for ] this discrepancy will be discussed later.

Figure 3 shows that DFM can improve the pseudo-saturation behavior. Here, a Ge precursor was injected through three 1 s consecutive pulses ( total pulse time: 3 s ) to compare its growth rate with the growth rate from the conventional ALD process. In DFM, the purge was also adjusted to three 5 s consecutive Ar pulses ( total purge time: 15 s . ) Figure 3 a ( ) shows that the growth rate reaches the saturation level with three 1 s Ge pulses ( 46.7 ng cm -2 cy -1 ) . The rate is signi /uniFB01 cantly larger than that from the conventional ALD process with a 3 s Ge pulse, and is comparable to the saturated value of the conventional ALD ( 7 s ) within an error range. Figure 3 b ( ) compares the growth rates of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm depending on the relative amount of Ge precursor injection with a given Ge pulse time ( 3 s . ) Due to the high vapor pressure of HGeCl3, the amount of the Ge precursor injection was adjusted by limiting the opening of a metering valve manually. The injection amount was reduced through the partial closure of the valve by changing the valve rotation number from the initial 3 to 2 and 1. It should be noted that the input amount control is only relative and not absolute because the information on the absolute amount depending on the valve rotation was not available. In all the cases, the DFM resulted in higher growth rates than with the conventional method, and showed a saturated growth rate with a reduced precursor amount ( blue circle data in /uniFB01 gure 3 b ( )) . Therefore, the DFM with the present conditions ( three-time rotation of the manual valve and 1 s injection x 3 ) represents the fully saturated ALD growth despite its much shorter total Ge precursor pulse time. An even more important /uniFB01 nding is that this faster saturation in DFM drastically enhanced the /uniFB01 lm quality and the OTS performance of the device compared with the similar /uniFB01 lm prepared through the conventional ALD process, as will be shown later. The conventional ALD method, however, showed a proportionally decreasing growth rate as the injection amount was reduced, consistent with the undersaturated condition of the 3 s Ge pulse time ( red square data in /uniFB01 gure 3 b ( )) .

The larger amount of precursor injection and the longer extended time required for its saturated growth in the conventional ALD process can be attributed to the screening of the reaction sites by the physisorbed molecules and reaction byproducts. Figure 3 c ( ) shows the mechanism of the ef /uniFB01 cient removal of the physisorbed molecules through the DFM process. In the proposed mechanism, the same ligand exchange reaction occurs as the conventional ALD process in the DFM, but the discretized feeding of the precursor can ef /uniFB01 ciently remove the steric hindrance from the physical absorption of the precursor molecules or byproducts ( i.e., HCl, ( CH3 3Si ) -Cl ) during the intermittent purge steps. The results are consistent with those of the previous study on DFM for the ALD of HfO2 [ 19 . In this ALD equipment, 1 s ] is the lower limit of the ALD valve opening with accurate /uniFB02 ow control. Therefore, the further subdivision of the 1 s long pulse was not attempted. The data in /uniFB01 gures 3 a ( ) and ( b )

demonstrate, however, that the observed growth rate was the DFM-saturated growth rate.

The proposed mechanism of the ef /uniFB01 cient removal of the physisorbed molecules helps in the understanding of the difference in the ALD behaviors of GeTe and GeSe /uniFB01 lms with the conventional feeding method. In the previous report on GeTe, the growth rate saturated rapidly with only a 5 s purge time [ 17 . The different bonding type can explain the different ] saturation behavior in the conventional ALD of Ge -Te and Ge Se -/uniFB01 lms. The deposited GeTe has a non-polar bonding nature due to the minimal difference in electronegativity between Ge and Te ( 0.09, in the Pauling electronegativity scale ) while GeSe has a polar bonding nature due to the larger difference in electronegativity ( 0.54 ) [ 20 . The polarity of the ] Ge Se -bonds induces a stronger dipole -dipole interaction between the /uniFB01 lm surface and the pulsed HGeCl3 and other byproducts, possibly leading to the stronger ( physical ) adsorption of the molecules compared to the non-polar van der Waals forces [ 21 . This stronger attraction can screen the ] reaction sites of the growing surface much more ef /uniFB01 ciently compared with the ALD in the GeTe case, and requires extended pulse and purge injection times to complete the reaction.

Figure 4 a ( ) shows the layer densities of the GeSe /uniFB01 lms grown at a substrate temperature of 70 ° C, as a function of the number of cycles, to determine the saturation growth rate and incubation cycles. Here, both the conventional ALD and ALD-DFM methods adopted saturated conditions for the precursor and purge injection times ( conventional ALD: Ge precursor pulse ( 7 s ) -purge ( 15 s ) -Se precursor pulse ( 2 s ) -purge ( 15 s ; ALD-DFM: Ge precursor pulse ) ( 1 s ) -purge ( 5 s ) -pulse ( 1 s ) -purge ( 5 s ) -pulse ( 1 s ) -purge ( 5 s ) -Se precursor ( 2 s ) -purge ( 15 s )) . The graphs for the conventional ALD reveal that the /uniFB01 lm grows linearly with the cycle number, without signi /uniFB01 cant incubation cycles. From the linear /uniFB01 tting, the 48.26 and 43.84 ng cm -2 cy -1 growth rates on the SiO2 and TiN substrates, respectively, were con /uniFB01 rmed. The growth rate of the /uniFB01 lm thickness can be calculated by dividing the growth rate in ng cm -2 cy -1 by the /uniFB01 lm density obtained from XRR measurement, and the converted rate of 1.12 Å cy -1 was obtained. The x value in Ge Se x ( 1 -x ) was also shown to be ∼ 0.5 regardless of the number of cycles. Overall, the results suggest a reasonable growth rate and a stoichiometry consistent with the reaction mechanism expected for normal ALD [ 22, 23 . ] The saturated growth rate from the DFM cannot be similarly estimated because only two data points are available ( 25 and 100 cycles . These data points ) ( red diamond , however, precisely lie on the graphs from the ) conventional ALD process, suggesting a similar growth behavior.

Figure 4 b ( ) shows the effect of the substrate temperature on the /uniFB01 lm growth in the conventional ALD process. The rates decreased from 46.5 to 3.2 ng cm -2 cy -1 on the SiO2 as the temperature changed from 70 ° C to 150 ° C. The x value in Ge Se 1 x ( -x ) was shown to be ∼ 0.5 ° C at 120 ° C but to have a slight increased at 140 ° C. The change in the Ge content was possibly due to the desorption of the volatile Se at a high temperature. The higher Ge content at a higher temperature

suggests that the oxidation state of Ge remains close to + 2 even under a high-temperature condition that could have led its oxidation to Ge IV . The results con ( ) /uniFB01 rm that even if the undissociated HGeCl3 participated in the reaction, it did not directly affect the composition. After the ligand exchange reaction, H with the -1 oxidation state in the reaction site ( HCl2 -Ge Se -) is changed to the + 1 oxidation state by a redox reaction with Ge IV ( ) and eliminated as HCl after binding with Cl [ 17 . If the ] Ge precursors were already dissociated into GeCl2 and HCl, only the + 2 oxidation form of the Ge precursor ( GeCl2 ) reacted in the chamber to form GeSe /uniFB01 lms.

Figure 5 compares the surface morphology of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm deposited through 100 cycles of the conventional ALD or ALD-DFM processes. Figure 5 a ( ) shows that the /uniFB01 lm deposited through the conventional method did not uniformly cover the substrate. The local variation in the amount of deposition

indicates the existence of screened reactive sites during the deposition. The surface morphology was signi /uniFB01 cantly improved by the DFM, as shown in the SEM and AFM images in /uniFB01 gures 5 b ( ) and ( d , ) respectively. The root mean square roughness was determined to be 4.41 and 6.42 nm for the /uniFB01 lms grown through the conventional ALD process on SiO2 and TiN substrates, respectively, and were changed into 0.350 and 0.514 nm for the /uniFB01 lms grown through the ALD-DFM process ( /uniFB01 gures 5 c ( ) and ( d )) . This is a more-than-one-order-of-magnitude improvement in surface roughness, which already implies that the /uniFB01 lm quality can be quite different.

show the XRR measurements and /uniFB01 ttings with a Si / SiO2 / GeSe sample structure. The densities and thicknesses of the /uniFB01 lms were 11.5 nm and 3.27 g cm -3 in the conventional ALD process, respectively, and 10.4 nm and 4.17 g cm -3 in the ALD-DFM process, respectively. The lower density of the /uniFB01 lm grown through the conventional ALD process may have been due to its susceptibility to oxidation under ambient conditions, which will be discussed subsequently in this paper. The density values were lower than that of the bulk crystalline GeSe but similar to the value of the amorphous GeSe deposited through the sputtering method [ 24 . The comparably larger deviation in the ] /uniFB01 tting of the XRR for the conventional ALD /uniFB01 lm originated from the roughness of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm.

The AES depth pro /uniFB01 les in /uniFB01 gures 6 c ( ) and ( d ) con /uniFB01 rm the stoichiometric composition of GeSe ( 1:1 ) for both /uniFB01 lms. A higher level of oxygen impurity is evident for the /uniFB01 lm grown through the conventional ALD process compared to the /uniFB01 lm grown via the ALD-DFM process. The results imply that the oxidation progressed less for the /uniFB01 lm grown through the ALD-DFM process than for the /uniFB01 lm grown through the conventional ALD process. The oxidation resistance of the DFM /uniFB01 lm will be shown, with the XPS analysis results, in /uniFB01 gure 7. The thickness of the /uniFB01 lms ( ∼ 10 nm ) has exaggerated the concentration of impurities ( O, C ) present on the surface after the exposure to the ambient condition. Nonetheless, it is necessary to examine this thickness region because the fabricated OTS device had a similar thickness.

The XPS analysis result presented in /uniFB01 gure 7 supports the difference in the chemical stability of the /uniFB01 lms against oxidation depending on the deposition method used. For this comparison, the XPS measurements were done without surface etching. ( When in situ etching was performed to remove the surface contaminants, the XPS peaks were unstable for the short etching times. After the extended etching times, the /uniFB01 lm recovered the original peaks due to the immediate reoxidation of the exposed surface. ) Consistent with the AES result in /uniFB01 gure 6, the Ge-oxide peaks in /uniFB01 gures 7 a ( ) and ( b ) show that almost the entire thickness of the /uniFB01 lms was contaminated by oxygen, possibly during the air exposure. The 1:1 stoichiometry of GeSe observed in the AES depth pro /uniFB01 les also supports this idea because the higher binding energy between Ge and O than that between Ge and Se would have led to a higher Ge / Se ratio, which is inconsistent with the AES results. Figure 7 a ( ) shows that the Geoxide peak was substantially larger than the Ge -Se peak for the conventional ALD process. In the case of the ALD-DFM process, the Ge Se peak was signi -/uniFB01 cant ( /uniFB01 gure 7 b ( )) . The locations of the Ge 3d and Se 3d peaks well match the binding energy in GeSe ( Ge 3d B.E.: ∼ 30.7 eV; Se 3d B.E.: ∼ 54.3 eV ) [ 25, 26 . As the Se 3d peak was observed at the ] previously reported binding energy without a signi /uniFB01 cant shift ( /uniFB01 gures 7 c ( ) and ( d )) , it can be concluded that Se was always bonded to two Ge atoms, consistent with the stoichiometric composition of GeSe. The results indicate that oxidation progressed less for the /uniFB01 lm grown through the ALD-DFM process than for the /uniFB01 lms grown through the conventional ALD process. It is possible that the lower density of the conventional ALD /uniFB01 lm allowed the easier penetration of the /uniFB01 lm by oxygen during the air exposure due to the highly porous surface. In either case, the observations suggest that the screening effect of the physisorbed molecules deteriorates the /uniFB01 lm quality, and that DFM can improve the quality by increasing the frequency of purging.

For the detailed amorphous structure, the FFT analysis results were obtained from the TEM images of the GeSe samples. It was con /uniFB01 rmed that the thickness of the GeSe /uniFB01 lms was similar to that in the XRR data for both deposition methods ( /uniFB01 gures 8 a ( ) and ( b )) . In addition, the structural order was slightly observed in the GeSe /uniFB01 lm deposited through the conventional ALD process ( right panel of /uniFB01 gure 8 a , where ( ) the FFT indicates some ordered phase rather than the perfect amorphous phase ) while the case of the ALD-DFM process showed a perfect amorphous phase.

The crystallization behavior of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm was studied before testing the OTS devices. A resistivity -temperature experiment was carried out to con /uniFB01 rm the feasibility of GeSe as OTS for the /uniFB01 lms deposited through the conventional ALD process and the ALD-DFM process shown in /uniFB01 gures 9 a ( ) and ( b , ) respectively. The transition temperatures to the low resistance state appeared at ∼ 337 ° C for the conventional ALD process and at ∼ 348 ° C for the ALD-DFM process due to the crystallization of the /uniFB01 lms. The GAXRD results in /uniFB01 gures 9 c ( ) and ( d ) con /uniFB01 rmed the crystallization temperature of GeSe consistent with the resistivity -temperature results. In the /uniFB01 lm deposited through the conventional ALD process, crystallization of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm was observed at 340 ° C, but in the case of the /uniFB01 lm deposited through the ALD-DFM process, the /uniFB01 lm was crystallized at 350 ° C. The results of the GeSe /uniFB01 lms grown through the ALD-DFM process corresponded

well to the crystallization temperature of the bulk GeSe ( ∼ 350 ° C ) [ 7 . ] The higher crystallization temperature of the ALD-DFM /uniFB01 lm suggests that DFM enhances the amorphous stability of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm, as supported by the TEM results in /uniFB01 gure 8.

## 3.2. OTS behavior of the GeSe films

Figure 10 shows the experiment set-up for the electrical measurement using a pulse generator ( /uniFB01 gure 10 a ( )) . The results of the measurements of the reference voltage V Ch1 at channel 1 and V Ch2 at channel 2 were used to calculate the voltage ( V DUT ) of the device-under-test ( DUT . The ) R Ch1 /uniF0A0 = /uniF0A0 1 M Ω , and the R Ch2 /uniF0A0 = 50 Ω . Figure 10 b ( ) shows the device structure on a hole-patterned substrate. The Si / W GeSe / ( ∼ 10 nm ) / Pt ( ∼ 50 nm ) structure was constructed from the ALD deposition of the GeSe /uniFB01 lm with the conventional or ALD-DFM processes ( 100 cycles ) and based on the subsequent lift-off pattern of the electron-beam-deposited Pt electrode.

Time-resolved I -V measurement was performed to con/uniFB01 rm the OTS behavior of the GeSe selector devices. First, the rising and falling times of the voltage pulse were set to 2 μ s for creating a triangle wave with a pulse amplitude V Ch1 of ∼ 3 V, as shown in /uniFB01 gures 11 a ( ) and ( b . Figure 11 a ) ( ) shows that the device constructed from the conventional ALD process did not exhibit the OTS behavior, but only leakage current appeared, possibly due to the distribution of Ge oxide

throughout the GeSe /uniFB01 lms, as shown above. The following mechanism can be suggested as the reason for such behavior. Many types of research have suggested that electronic switching of the chalcogenide materials occurs via the involvement of the valence alternation pairs ( VAPs . ) The group VI element chalcogens ( C ) readily undergo a disproportionate reaction, as follows [ 27 -30 : ]

$$2 C _ { 2 } ^ { 0 } \rightarrow C _ { 3 } ^ { + } + C _ { 1 } ^ { - }. \quad \ \ \ ( 1 ) \quad \ \.$$

The disproportionation reaction from the neutral atoms ( C2 0 ) to two charged chalcogen atoms ( C3 + and C1 -) is energetically favorable. ( The subscripts and superscript of C represent the coordination number and the charge of the chalcogen atom ( C , ) respectively. ) These charged defects form localized states acting as deep and shallow traps near the Fermi level and the conduction band, respectively. When a voltage is applied, the traps provide a current path with a lowered energy barrier. It is hard for devices fabricated through the conventional ALD process, however, to possess such traps due to the stronger binding energy of Ge -O. For disproportionation to occur, the Coulombic repulsion energy ( Uc ) should be compensated for by polaron shift ( w ) . In particular, the negative-U model can be established when w &gt; /uniF0A0 Uc / 2 is satis /uniFB01 ed [ 31 . ] The polaron shift is de /uniFB01 ned as Q 2 / 2 k in the mechanical analogy of the negative-U effect ( Q : deformation potential for the localized carriers; k : spring constant , where ) k can be considered the binding energy value [ 31 . The model can explain the difference between SiO2 ] and SiTe in VAPs formation. In SiO2 ( B.E. ∼ 799.6 kJ mol -1 ) , polaron shift cannot proceed due to the dif /uniFB01 culty in lattice deformation; as such, the formation of VAPs is suppressed. The lower binding energy of SiTe ( B.E. ∼ 425 kJ mol -1 ) , however, allowed the OTS behavior in it. In this study, Ge -O ( B.E. ∼ 659.4 kJ mol -1 ) had a stronger bond than GeSe ( B.E. ∼ 484.7 kJ mol -1 ) , making it dif /uniFB01 cult to form VAPs [ 32 -35 . ] As a result, OTS behavior could not occur due to the high level of oxygen in the /uniFB01 lm deposited through the conventional ALD process.

Figures 11 b ( ) -( d ) show the OTS behavior of the device fabricated through the ALD-DFM process. A sudden decrease in V DUT, called ' voltage snapback, ' can be observed in /uniFB01 gure 11 c ( ) due to the sudden reduction in the resistance of the GeSe /uniFB01 lms at ∼ 1.04 μ s. The V Ch1 at this point can be de /uniFB01 ned as the threshold voltage ( V th ) . The device exhibited a short switching time of ∼ 40 ns ( /uniFB01 gure 11 c ( )) [ 8 . ] Low resistance ( on-state ) was maintained until the voltage dropped to the holding voltage ( Vh ) , and switching to the off-state occurred again at about 3.23 μ s due to the increase in resistance of the GeSe /uniFB01 lms ( /uniFB01 gure 11 d ( )) .

Figure 12 a ( ) presents an I DUT -V DUT curve of the device obtained from the pulse response measurement. The curve clearly shows the threshold switching of the device resistance to around 1.9 V. At the low resistance state, a ∼ 10 -2 A onstate current ( I on ) measurement was obtained. Figure 12 b ( ) presents a similar result, but the response was measured using a voltage sweep method with a compliance current of 10 -3 A. The off-state current ( I off ) and reading current ( I read ) were about ∼ 10 -9 and ∼ 10 -6 A, respectively, when the reading

voltage for I read was one half of V th . Based on the I on measurement value shown in /uniFB01 gure 12 a , the ON ( ) / OFF current ratio of the device was calculated as ∼ 10 . 7 The reading selectivity de /uniFB01 ned as the current ratio between the cells under operation and the other cells in passive arrays were estimated to be ∼ 10 4 when the selected cell for operation was assumed to be under an operation voltage while the remaining cells were under a half of the operation voltage. This value is among the best-reported selectivity values of OTS devices [ 10 . The red line in ] /uniFB01 gure 12 b ( ) shows a simulation /uniFB01 t to a modi /uniFB01 ed PF model proposed by Ielmini et al to describe the off-state current density ( J ) of the amorphous chalcogenides under the applied electric /uniFB01 eld F [ 36, 37 : ]

$$\intertext { n e a p p e a e c u r e n e a r } J & = 2 q N _ { T } \frac { \Delta z } { \tau _ { 0 } } e ^ { - \frac { E _ { c } ^ { \prime } - E _ { F 0 } } { k T } } \sinh \left ( \frac { q F \Delta z } { 2 k T } \right ). \quad \quad ( 2 )$$

Here, q is the elementary charge; NT is the density of traps between the conduction band and the Fermi level ( Ec ′ and EF 0 ) ; and Δ z and 0 t are the inter-trap distance between the localized states and the attempt-to-escape time for the trapped electrons, respectively. In the low-voltage range, ( in the off-state ) NT and Δ z can be obtained by /uniFB01 tting through equation ( 2 . ) The value of Ec ′ /uniF0A0 -/uniF0A0 EF 0 was assumed to be 0.54 eV, as reported by Naga et al , and 0 t is assumed to be 1 fs [ 38 . The ] /uniFB01 tted values were NT /uniF0A0 = /uniF0A0 5.36 /uniF0A0 × /uniF0A0 10 20 cm -3 and Δ z /uniF0A0 = /uniF0A0 1.41 /uniF0A0 × /uniF0A0 10 -7 cm.

## 4. Conclusions

In this work, GeSe /uniFB01 lms were deposited through the ALD method to fabricate an OTS selector device for the phasechange-memory-based crossbar array. HGeCl3 and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se were used as Ge and Se precursors, respectively, and the typical ALD temperature was 70 ° C. The 1:1 stoichiometric composition of GeSe was achieved by the decomposition of HGeCl3 into divalent GeCl2 and the subsequent ligand exchange reaction with the [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Se. This is a mechanism similar to the previously reported GeTe ALD using an identical Ge precursor and [ ( CH3 3Si ) ] 2 Te. Nonetheless, the much higher polar nature of the Ge Se bond compared with the Ge --Te bond induced an inef /uniFB01 -cient purging of the physisorbed Ge precursor molecules, which

subsequently induced a very long purge time. This process showed problems in guaranteeing a high-quality /uniFB01 lm, and the resulting /uniFB01 lms were highly vulnerable to the oxidation during the air exposure after the ALD. The adverse oxidation totally prohibited the desired OTS switching behavior of the fabricated device. In contrast, the /uniFB01 lm grown through the ALD-DFM process, which effectively purged out the excessive Ge precursor molecules during the ALD, resulted in a much denser and smooth /uniFB01 lm. DFM induced a growth rate at a total Ge precursor pulse time of 3 s that was identical to that at a total Ge precursor pulse time of 7 s in the conventional ALD process. This higher density /uniFB01 lm effectively suppressed the adverse oxidation of the /uniFB01 lm, which allowed the /uniFB02 uent operation of the device in the OTS mode. The achieved switching time was as short as 40 ns, and the selectivity was as high as 10 , among the highest reported for the 4 chalcogenide-based OTS selectors. The /uniFB01 tting of the current -voltage curve to the modi /uniFB01 ed PF equation revealed that the trap density was 5.36 /uniF0A0 × /uniF0A0 10 20 cm -3 .
