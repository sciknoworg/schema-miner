Very pure Co films were depositedby PE-ALD with CoCp2 and NH3 plasma. However, various analyses have shown that amorphousSiNx interlayer was formed between PE-ALD Co and Si due to the NH3 plasma exposure in contrastwith PVD Co. Due to the nitride interlayer, CoSi2 was epitaxially grown from PE-ALD Co by rapidthermal annealing through nitride mediated epitaxy. This process scheme is expected to provide asimple route for contact formation in future nanoscale devices. © 2007 American Institute ofPhysics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2742791CoSi2 has been widely studied for the contact materialsof nanoscale metal-oxide-semiconductor filed effect transis-tor due to the absence of narrow line effect. However, ag-glomeration and void formation during the silicidation orpostthermal process due to grain grooving and interfaceroughening of polycrystalline silicide could become a poten-tial problem.1 Epitaxial CoSi2 with lower contact resistanceis one of the candidates to solve these problems, especiallyfor shallow junction devices due to its good layer uniformityand high thermal stability. Interlayer mediated epitaxy IMEis one of the promising techniques for CoSi2 epitaxy since itis compatible with current Si technology and does not re-quire expensive processing tools. For this purpose, variousinterlayer materials have been employed including oxide,2nitride,3 and CoNx.4 So far, additional process step has beencarried out to form appropriate interlayer. For example, ni-tride interlayer was formed by very high temperature900 °C nitridation.3We recently developed plasma-enhanced atomic layerdeposition PE-ALD Co process with high purity and lowresistivity.5 In this study, we investigated the interface be-tween PE-ALD Co and Si substrate, comparatively withphysical vapor deposition PVD Co. Due to the use of NH3plasma as a reactant, a few nanometer thick nitride interlayerwas formed during the deposition process. By rapid thermalannealing RTA of the PE-ALD Co, CoSi2 was formed epi-taxially through nitride mediated epitaxy NME withoutseparate interlayer formation step.Co films were deposited on Si001 substrate by usingPE-ALD chamber connected to dc magnetron sputteringchamber via load lock to form a cluster system, enabling thein situ deposition of capping layer.5 CoCp2 and NH3 plasmawere used as a Co precursor and a reactant, respectively. Thestandard NH3 plasma exposure time tr was 6 s and thegrowth temperature was 300 °C. Further details of PE-ALDCo film growth can be found in our previous report.5 Forcomparison, Co films were also deposited by dc magnetronsputtering at room temperature with plasma power of 120 W.The chemical bonding structure and impurity level of Cofilms were investigated by Rutherford backscattering, x-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy XPS, and secondary ion massspectroscopy SIMS. Synchrotron radiation x-ray diffractionSR-XRD and high resolution transmission electron micro-scope HR-TEM were used for microstructure analysis.Postdeposition annealing to form silicide was carried out for30 s by a RTA system in N2 environment. For silicidation,20 nm thick Ti capping layer was deposited by in situ sput-tering on PE-ALD and PVD Co without vacuum breaking.As reported previously, PE-ALD Co films have shownlow resistivity of 10  cm due to high purity.5 Figures 1aand 1b are cross sectional HR-TEM images of PVD andPE-ALD Co on Si substrates, respectively. Both of PVD andPE-ALD Co films were polycrystalline, which agrees withXRD spectra showing -Co diffraction peaks.5 Figure 1ashows the formation of 3 nm thick interlayer between PVDCo and Si. There have been several reports on the formationof amorphous CoSix interlayer for PVD Co on Si substrateeven at room temperature.6 Similar TEM image to Fig. 1awas reported in Ref. 6, indicating that the interlayer for ourcase is also CoSix. As shown in Fig. 1b, however, the23 nm thick amorphous interlayer between PE-ALD Coand Si substrate has apparently different contrast and struc-ture from that of PVD Co and Si.To investigate the interlayer of Co and Si substrate,SIMS depth profiles were obtained data not shown. ThePE-ALD Co was very pure, with very small oxygen andnitrogen contaminations in the film. In fact, the nitrogen andoxygen contents in the film were smaller than those of PVDCo.

For better analysis of this inter-layer, XPS analysis was carried out after the Co layer wasremoved by selective etching H2SO4:H2O2=4:1, volumeratio. Figure 2 shows the XPS spectra for Si binding energyregion. The deconvolution of the XPS spectrum in Fig. 2shows that it is composed of three peaks at 98.6, 101, and102.6 eV. The peak at 98.6 eV solid line was assigned tothe SiSi bond from the Si substrate, while two lower energypeaks were assigned to SiN dash line and SiO dot linebonding, respectively.7 XPS spectrum for N binding energyregion was composed mostly of NSi bond, and the Co peakintensity was very small in contrast to PVD Co for whichsignificant Co XPS peaks were observed. These results, to-gether with SIMS depth profile, strongly suggest that theinterlayer for PE-ALD Co is amorphous SiNx not CoSix.One of the plausible reasons for SiNx interlayer forma-tion during the PE-ALD Co is a direct exposure of Si sub-strate by NH3 plasma at initial deposition cycles. In fact, thenitridation process using NH3 plasma has been investigatedfor various applications in microelectronics technology.8 Toestimate the SiNx formation in our experimental conditions,the Si001 substrates were exposed to NH3 plasma at300 °C. A few nanometer thick SiNx film formation wasconfirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometer. In contrast withNH3 plasma, no SiNx film was formed by NH3 gas at300 °C. The SiNx layer formation alters the growth charac-teristics of PE-ALD Co. For Co chemical vapor depositionusing CoCp2 and H2, the deposition selectivity on severalsubstrates has been reported.9 For example, the Co filmswere deposited on SiO2 and Si3N4, not on Si substrate, whichwas attributed to the difficulty in CoCp2 adsorption onH-terminated surface. In our case, however, Co films weredeposited by PE-ALD using NH3 plasma without nuclea-tion delay on Si as well as on SiO2. This behavior canbe explained by the formation of SiNx on the Si surface byNH3 plasma during the initial deposition cycles, which en-ables the nucleation of Co film and leads to nonselectivity indeposition.To investigate the effects of SiNx interlayer on solid statereaction between Co and Si, PE-ALD and PVD Co filmswith in situ PVD Ti capping layer were annealed at variousannealing temperatures. For 20 nm Ti/20 nm PVDCo/Si001 sample, weak CoSi 210 peak was observed atTa=600 °C, and strong CoSi2 220 was observed with small111 peaks at Ta700 °C. These results are consistent withprevious reports on silicide formation from PVD Co on Sisubstrate, for which polycrystalline CoSi2 were formed at ahigh enough annealing temperature, while monosilicidephase is formed at a low annealing temperature.10 In contrastwith PVD Co case, however, SR-XRD spectra for the an-nealed 20 nm Ti/20 nm PE-ALD Co/Si001 sample hasshown clearly different results, as shown in Fig. 3. First ofall, no silicide related peaks were observed at up to 700 °C.At Ta=800 °C, only CoSi2 002 diffraction peak was ob-served at 2=33.5°. With further increase in annealing tem-perature to 900 °C, the CoSi2 002 peak intensity has grownsignificantly.Further analysis was carried out for the sample annealedat 800 °C. Figure 4 shows the high resolution cross sectionalTEM image. We can see a newly formed 5 nm thick layerwith darker contrast than Si substrate was formed. SiNxlayer, which was originally located between Co and Si, re-sides now above this layer. This was confirmed to be a CoSi2layer by energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis during theHR-TEM analysis with 0.5 Å spot size. The registry of lat-FIG. 2.

To check the in-plane orientation, weperformed x-ray scattering with  scan geometry along theazimuthal direction with the slant angle of 45 ° on the sur-face normal using Cu K source. For this analysis, the cap-ping layer and remaining Co film were selectively etchedprior to the analysis. Figure 5 shows the F scans of the 220peak of the CoSi2 thin film on the Si001 substrate. Thefourfold symmetry of 220 peak of the CoSi2 thin film wasobserved, and the full width at half maximum of an in-plane220 peak was equal to 0.4°, indicating that a high qualityCoSi2 epitaxial film was formed. The HR-TEM and XRDresults indicate that the CoSi2 is epitaxial with Si001 sub-strate with a cube-on-cube relationship, CoSi2100 Si100.It is worth noting that no monosilicide phase or other Corich phase has been formed by annealing the PE-ALD Cosample at a low temperature. This absence of monosilicide ormetal rich phase formation is a typical characteristic of IMEprocess.2 Since we did not intentionally form an interlayerfor IME, we attribute this epitaxial growth to NME due tothe amorphous SiNx interlayer, formed by NH3 plasma reac-tion with substrate. In NME, the nitride interlayer does notreact with Co but limits the Co diffusion when the interlayeris very thin, 5 nm.As seen in Fig. 4, the interface between CoSi2 and Siwas relatively nonuniform with 111 facets. These are com-mon observations for IME when the capping layer and Cothickness are not fully optimized. For instance, in a previousreport on NME, the CoSi2 was grown as an island shape andwas not continuous because of nonoptimization of Cothickness.3 Another study on IME using CoNx interlayer hasshown that the interlayer thicknesses and chemical composi-tion affect the thickness and interface of epitaxial CoSi2.4Thus, the control of interlayer thickness is one of the require-ments to control the IME of CoSi2. In a separate experiment,the SiNx interlayer thickness was reduced from 3 to 1 nm bydecreasing the plasma expose time tr from 6 to 2 s. Thus,SiNx interlayer thickness can be readily controlled by chang-ing tr for our process scheme. However, since the requiredjunction depth is below 10 nm, which will be decreased tobelow 5 nm in 2012 according to the International Technol-ogy Roadmap for Semiconductors,11 even the very thin epi-taxial CoSi2 layer shown in Fig. 4 can be utilized for contactin ultrashallow junction.So far, the interlayers for IME were fabricated throughseparate process steps. For example, oxide interlayer wasfabricated by wet chemical process, while nitride layer wasfabricated by thermal nitridation at annealing temperatureover 900 °C.3 In another report, the CoNx interlayer for IMEwas formed by a separate deposition step followed by Codeposition.4 In the present study, however, the interlayer wasformed without additional process through self-interlayerformation during the PE-ALD. Additionally, high conformal-ity of PE-ALD Co film is another big advantage, which can-not be achieved by PVD. Thus, the current process schemeprovides a simple route for the formation of epitaxial CoSi2contact for future nanoscale devices.The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supportof Korea Electronic Technology Institute, BK21 Program,and POSTECH Core Research Program.
