INTRODUCTIONCopper is the most promising material for the next gen-eration beyond 65 nm interconnect technology due to itslower resistivity and larger electro-stress-migration resis-tance than Al-based materials. However, copper atoms easilydiffuse into silicon devices at low temperature, which couldcause critical degradation of device performance.1 For suc-cessful implementation of copper interconnect technology, itis essential to utilize highly reliable diffusion barrier. Espe-cially, as the minimum feature size of silicon devices shrinks,copper diffusion barriers should scale down accordingly. Thereason for this is that thick diffusion barriers would leavelittle space for Cu, nullifying the advantage of Cumetallization.2,3 Thus, more effective but thinner Cu diffu-sion barrier materials are required as device scaling contin-ues. Various materials, including Ta, Ti, TaN, TiN, TaSiN,TiSiN, and WN, have been investigated as copper diffu-sion barriers. Among these, TiSiN, one of amorphous re-fractory materials, is a promising candidate for this applica-tion since it does not have fast diffusion paths, such as grainboundary, which is present in polycrystalline materials.47Until now, TiSiN films have been deposited using an rfreactive sputtering technique.8 Although physical vapordeposition PVD including sputtering produces good qualityfilms with reasonable barrier properties, it will soon reachcritical limits in silicon device application with increasingaspect ratio and decreasing size of contact, via, and trench,etc., due to its inherent poor conformality. To overcome thisproblem, other deposition techniques including chemical va-por deposition CVD and atomic layer deposition ALDhave been investigated to deposit TiSiN films. CVD ofTiSiN thin films were reported from as early as 1980s.TiCl4 was employed as metal precursor, which reacted withSi source such as SiH2Cl2 or SiCl4 and nitrogen source suchas NH3 or N2/H2 at temperatures above 1000 °C.9,10 How-ever, the requirement of very high temperature makes it un-desirable for silicon device fabrication. Later, Si alloying ofTiN has been carried out by plasma-assisted chemical vapordeposition PACVD from TiCl4, N2, and SiH4 in argon atlower temperatures 500 °C.11 However, lower tempera-ture deposition process is required for application as inter-connect, for which the process temperature is limited to be-low 400 °C. More recently, metal-organic CVD MOCVDRef. 12 and ALD Ref. 13 processes have been developed,using tetrakisdimethylamino titanium TDMAT, NH3, andSiH4 at temperature below 400 °C. Despite lower depositiontemperature, these processes have problems of significant Ccontamination, uncontrollable film composition, inaccuratethickness control, poor resistivity, etc.In this article, we have developed plasma-enhancedatomic layer deposition PEALD process of TiSiN filmsfrom TiCl4 precursor. The effects of Si incorporation in TiSiN film properties such as microstructure and diffusionbarrier properties and the deposition mechanism were inves-tigated by changing the precursor-reactant supplying se-quence. The focus was on a development of a promisingALD process to overcome the limitations of conventionalALD process, such as poor resistivity, deficiency of reac-tants, etc., and to inherit the benefits of ALD such as accuratethickness control, excellent conformality, digital controllablecomposition, and so on.II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURETiSiN films were deposited on SiO2 by the alternatesupply of TiCl4 as a Ti precursor, SiH4 as a Si precursor, andaElectronic mail: hyungjun@postech.ac.kr1327 1327J. Vac. Sci.

The deposition temperature and pres-sure were set as 350 °C and 3 torr, respectively. The sche-matic diagram of apparatus used is shown in Fig. 1. Thisdeposition apparatus consists of a double chamber structurewhich includes hot wall inner chamber, cold wall outerchamber, a gas switching system, a pumping system, and aradio frequency rf generator 13.56 MHz. The reactor inthe inner chamber is a vertical flow type to improve a gasswitching timing and uniform plasma density. The showerhead was used not only as the distributor of gases but also asthe electrode to generate plasma.Nitrogen 200 SCCM SCCM denotes cubic centimeterper minute at STP, H2 20 SCCM, and Ar 200 SCCMwere mixed in the showerhead and passed over the waferduring processing. Various precursor-reactant exposure se-quences were used and N2 purge period was inserted be-tween each reactant gas pulse to isolate the reactant gasesfrom each other. As an example, TSN* sequence con-sisted of exposure to TiCl4, a purge period with N2, exposureto SiH4, a purge period with N2, and exposure to N2/H2/Arplasma. Here, T, S, and N* represent TiCl4, SiH4, andN2/H2/Ar plasma supplies the asterisk means plasma igni-tion, respectively. Other exposure sequences are summa-rized in Table I. To ignite and maintain the N2/H2/Ar plasmasynchronized with the deposition cycle, a rectangular electri-cal power wave was applied between the upper showerheadand lower substrate electrodes. The plasma source operatedat a power of 150 W for 10 s, capacitively coupled with aradio frequency 13.56 MHz.The film thickness and resistivity were analyzed with asurface profile meter TENCOR Ins. 200 and four pointprobe, respectively. X-ray diffraction XRD was performedto determine the microstructure. The composition and siliconcontent in TiSiN films were determined using 9.0 MeVCl5+ elastic recoil detection time of flight ERD-TOF,2.43 MeV He2+ Rutherford backscattering spectroscopyRBS, and Auger electron spectroscopy AES. Electronspectroscopy for chemical analysis ESCA, Mg K=1253.6 eV was used to analyze the chemical bonding sta-tus of the TiSiN in the films. Transmission electron mi-croscopy TEM was performed to examine the size and mi-crostructure of the TiSiN thin film.For the diffusion barrier test, 100 nm thick Cu films weredeposited by dc rotating sputter system on PEALD TiN andTiSiN films 10 nm thickness/p-type Si substrate. Thecondition of Cu sputtering was 2000 W of power with8 SCCM Ar flow. Rapid thermal annealing RTA systemwas used to anneal the prepared samples with a temperatureramping rate of 150 °C/min in Ar circumstance. The diffu-sion barrier properties of all the samples were studied bymonitoring the sheet resistance and phase change by fourpoint probe and XRD.III.

Download to IP:  141.223.201.130 On: Tue, 28 Apr 2015 04:37:17Table I. Firstly, the reaction between TiCl4 and N2/H2/Arplasma TN* was investigated by performing PEALD ofTiN films. TiN thin films were successfully grown, indicatingstrong reaction between these. The growth rate was saturatedat about 0.46 Å/cycle and the resistivity of thin film wasabout 80  cm. Second set, SiH4 and N2/H2/Ar plasmaSN*, indicates week reaction between these. AlthoughSi3N4 thin film was deposited on Si substrate, the growth ratewas very small as about 0.1 Å/cycle. Meanwhile, TiCl4 andSiH4 molecules did not react together at 350 °C.TiSiN PEALD was performed by using various expo-sure sequences of TiCl4, SiH4, and N2/H2/Ar plasma, assummarized in Table I. Figure 2 shows the dependence of thegrowth rate Å/cycle and silicon content in TiSiN thinfilms on the SiH4 pulse time for the first sequence studied,TSN* sequence. In this case, TiSiN films were grownby a sequential supplying of TiCl4 for 1 s, SiH4 for 015 s,and N2/H2/Ar plasma for 10 s. The partial pressure of SiH4during exposure was fixed at 0.1 torr. When the SiH4 pulsetime exceeded 7 s, the growth rate and silicon content inTiSiN thin films were saturated at 0.73 Å/cycle and8.8 at. % Cl content 0.5 at. %, respectively. The resistiv-ity of TiSiN thin films was also higher at about500  cm the resistivity in TiN PEALD was 80  cm.The saturation of the growth rate and the Si content indicatesthat SiH4 is incorporated by a self-limiting reaction and thatN2/H2/Ar plasma is capable of acting as a reducing agentduring this reaction.In the current experiments, the growth rate was higherthan that of TiN PEALD, which was about 0.46 Å/cycle asmentioned above. In the previous work on TiSiN ALDusing TDMAT TiNCH324, SiH4, and NH3, however, thegrowth rate was smaller than that of TiN ALD. It was pro-posed that the SiH4 molecules block the available adsorptionsites of TDMAT molecule resulting in growth ratereduction.13 Thus, the higher growth rate of TiSiN PEALDthan TiN indicates that the growth mechanism is quite differ-ent than TiSiN ALD from TDMAT. We propose that forTiSiN from TiCl4, the number of TiCl4 molecules ad-sorbed on SN* terminated surface is more than that onTN* terminated surface resulting in growth rate increase.Next, TN*SN* sequence was performed by sequentialsupply of TiCl4 for 1 s, N2 purge for 10 s, N2/H2/Ar plasmafor 10 s, N2 purge for 1 s, SiH4 pulse for 10 s, N2 purge for10 s, N2/H2/Ar plasma for 10 s, and N2 purge for 1 s. Thissequence is composed of alternate deposition step of TiNand Si3N4 PEALD growth sequence. However, the growthrate 0.89 Å/cycle was turned out to be higher than thesummation of growth rate of TiN 0.46 Å/cycle and Si3N4PEALD 0.1 Å/cycle, respectively. This result again can beexplained by the same proposition mentioned above, in otherwords, the SN* terminated surface provides higher adsorp-tion site density for TiCl4 molecules than TN* terminatedsurface TiN film.Finally, STN* sequence was investigated and com-pared with TSN* sequence shown in Fig. 2. For STN*sequence, the reactants were supplied in the sequence ofSiH4 for 10 s, TiCl4 for 1 s, and N2/H2/Ar plasma for 10 s.The growth rates and Si composition for this case are shownin Fig. 3. The overall trends are similar to the results shownin Fig. 2. However, the growth rates of the TiSiN PEALDat saturation condition was about 0.60 Å/cycle, which is sig-nificantly smaller than that from the TSN* sequence. Thesaturation occurs when the SiH4 pulse time exceeds 10 s. Atthis saturation condition, the Si content was about 13 at. %.Here, it should be noted that the growth rate and siliconcontent is different between TSN* 0.73 Å/cycle, 8.8 at. %and STN* 0.6 Å/cycle, 13 at. % sequences. This differencemay be explained by the changes in TiCl4 and SiH4 mol-ecules adsorption reaction depending on the exposure se-quence. In TSN* sequence, TiCl4 molecules would adsorb onSN* terminated surface while in STN* sequence, theywould adsorb on SiH terminated surface. Since TiCl4 andSiH4 molecules do not react each other at deposition tem-perature, 350 °C, the blockade of SiH4 molecules in STN*FIG. 2.

The films were grown on SiO2 at 350 °C withthe sequential supply of TiCl4 for 1 s, SiH4 for 0 s15 s, and N2/H2/Arplasma for 10 s. The partial pressure of SiH4 was fixed at 0.1 torr.FIG. 3.

Also,for TSN* sequence, where SiH4 molecules adsorb in TiClterminated surface, the adsorption amount of SiH4 is smaller8.8 at. %  than that for STN* sequence 13 at. % , whereSiH4 molecules adsorb on TiN* terminated surface. How-ever, more detailed surface reaction chemistry should beinvestigated to obtain more decisive and quantitativeexplanation.X-ray diffraction profiles of TiSiN and TiN thin filmsformed by PEALD are shown in Fig. 4. Well-resolved XRDpeaks including 111, 200, and 220 diffraction peaksfrom cubic TiN were detected for PEALD TiN films. Whilethe XRD spectrum of the TiSiN thin film is similar to thatof the TiN PEALD, but has much weaker and broader peaksthan that of TiN PEALD at the same deposition tempera-tures. Thus, the crystallinity of the film is much poor forTiSiN films. To obtain more information on the micro-structure of TiSiN and TiN PEALD thin films, TEM plan-view analysis was performed Fig. 5. Agreeing with XRDresults, PEALD TiN film is composed of well-developedpolycrystalline grains with size above 30 nm, while thePEALD TiSiN films is composed of nanocrystalline grainswith below 10 nm size embedded in amorphous matrix. Thecross-sectional TEM not shown indicates that the TiN filmsappear to be a columnar structure while TiSiN has a ran-domly oriented structure. It is reported that the partial re-placement of the Ti atoms by Si atoms in TiN films disturbsthe smooth growth of the columnar grains resulting in nano-crystalline structure.14Figure 6 shows the ESCA spectra showing the chemicalbonding states of the N 1s Fig. 6a and Si 2p Fig. 6band in TiSiN thin films deposited by TSN* sequence. Thedeposition conditions consisted of sequential supplying ofTiCl4 for 1 s, SiH4 for 10 s, and N2/H2/Ar plasma for 10 sat 350 °C, 3 torr, and 150 W. The binding energy of the Si2p was 101.8 eV, indicating that the silicon in TiSiN thinfilm exists as a Si3N4 and the binding energy of the N 1s isshown as two peaks centered at 396.7 and 397.5 eV, whichare TiN and Si3N4 bonding, respectively. This suggests thatTiSiN thin films consist of TiN and Si3N4 bonding becausethe chemical binding of Ti 2p only involves TiN bondingwithout any TiSi bonding not shown. This result is con-sistent with other previous reported results on CVD andPECVD TiSiN. On the other hand, the previous report onTiSiN MOALD using TDMAT, SiH4, and NH3, Si3N4phase was not observed because SiH4 and NH3 did not reactat 180 °C of deposition temperature.15 The formation ofSi3N4 phase, observed in the current study, would give toincrease resistivity in TiSiN thin films and improve Cudiffusion barrier properties.16 Based upon these x-ray photo-emission spectroscopy XPS results together with XRD andTEM results, we can infer that the PEALD TiSiN is com-posed of TiN nanocrystalline grains embedded in Si3N4-likeamorphous matrix.To evaluate the Cu diffusion barrier properties, test struc-tures composed of Cu films deposited on top of either theTiN or TiSiN thin films thickness of 10 nm on Si sub-strates were prepared.

The sheet resistance ofboth samples was measured by four point probe after 30 minof heat treatment at a temperature between 450 and 700 °C.The sheet resistance was initially 0.47  / for the Cu/TiNPEALD/Si, which slowly decreases to 0.41  / by 500 °C,and then increased sharply at above 550 °C. On the otherhand, the sheet resistance of Cu/TiSiN PEALD/Si slowlydecreased to 0.30  / by 600 °C, and then drastically in-creased above 650 °C. The large increase of sheet resistanceis due to the formation of CuSi compounds following Cudiffusion through barrier TiN and TiSiN in this case, andthis temperature can be considered as the Cu diffusion bar-rier failure temperature.For further information, XRD analysis has been per-formed for both samples and the results are shown in Fig. 8.Three Cu XRD peaks near 43°, 50°, and 75° grew graduallywith increasing the annealing temperature by 500 °C inTiN PEALD and 600 °C in TiSiN PEALD. A furtherincrease of the Cu-related peaks accompanied by the evolu-tion of new peaks near 44°46°, as indicated in Fig. 8. Thisindicates the formation of CuSi compound Cu3Si phaseformed by the Cu diffusion through diffusion barrier.17,18 Theresults in Fig. 8, together with those in Fig. 7, indicate thatthe PEALD TiSiN has a better diffusion barrier propertythan that of PEALD TiN, with at least 100 °C higher diffu-sion barrier failure temperature.Previous report indicates that the microstructure of diffu-sion barrier might affect the diffusion barrier propertysignificantly.19 The microstructure of PEALD TiSiN isnanocrystalline embedded in amorphous matrix, while thatof PEALD TiN is columnar polycrystalline.

Thus, thebetter performance of PEALD TiSiN compared to TiN isattributed to the formation of Si3N4-like amorphous phase.With decreasing device size requiring ultrathin diffusion bar-rier, the amorphous-like TiSiN would be a good diffusionbarrier material. Together with good conformality of ALDprocess, the PEALD TiSiN could be a potentially essentialcomponent for successful fabrication of semiconductor de-vice beyond 65 nm technology node.IV. CONCLUSIONTiSiN and TiN thin films have been deposited byPEALD using TiCl4, SiH4, and N2/H2/Ar plasma using vari-ous precursor-reactant exposure sequences. The growth char-acteristics and film properties were largely dependent on theexposure sequences, which were explained by the differencesin reactant molecule adsorption reactions. With the incorpo-ration of Si atoms, the microstructure of the films changed toamorphous with the increase in resistivity. The PEALD TiSiN films were composed of TiN nanocrystalline grains andSi3N4-like amorphous phase. Due to the amorphous micro-structure and existence of Si3N4-like amorphous phase, thediffusion barrier property against Cu has been greatlyimproved.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work was supported through the project of NationalResearch Laboratory and Brain Korea 21 foundation.1A.
