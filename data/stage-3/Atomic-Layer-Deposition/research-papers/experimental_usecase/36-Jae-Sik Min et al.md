Titanium-silicon-nitride films were grown by metal-organic atomic-layer deposition at 180 °C. When silane was supplied separately in the sequence of a tetrakislamido titanium pulse, ~ dimethy ! silane pulse, and ammonia pulse, the Si content in the deposited films and the deposition thickness per cycle remained almost constant at 18 at. % and 0.22 nm/cycle, even though the silane partial pressure varied from 0.27 to 13.3 Pa. Especially, the Si content dependence is strikingly different from the conventional chemical-vapor deposition. The capacitance-voltage measurement revealed that the Ti-Si-N film prevents the diffusion of Cu up to 800 °C for 60 min. Step coverage was approximately 100% even on the 0.3m diam hole with slightly negative slope and 10:1 aspect m ratio. © 1999 American Institute of Physics. @ S0003-6951 99 01137-7 ~ ! #

The difference between MOALD and MOCVD may originate from the fact that the Si content in the MOALD is lse for 10 s. The Si content increases as the SiH controlled by the amount of SiH hat can be adsorbed on the 4 t surface during a SiH pulse. As a preliminary experiment, it o the conventional CVD that the Si content increases ac4 was observed that there was no reaction between SiH d 4 an TDMAT, or SiH 4 and NH 3 at 180 °C. These results indicateer cycle decreases continuously as the Si content in the film that SiH cannot react directly with TDMAT or NHat this 4 3 temperature. Thus, the amount of available adsorption sites on is that the number of reactant molecules that contribfor SiH would be limited, since most of the available ad- e to the film deposition during one cycle decreases due to 4 sorption sites on the surface have been already occupied by SiH 4 TDMAT molecules, which were chemisorbed on the surface during the prior injection of the TDMAT pulse. Therefore, e overall reaction rate during one cycle. the Si content in the Ti-Si-N films will be controlled by the Metal-oxide-semiconductor MOS amount of SiH 4 adsorbed on the surface, not by the SiH nm 4 partial pressure. experiment, SiHand NH 4 3 were simultaneously supplied in the sequence of the TDMAT pulse fo 5 s and the SiH/NH r 4 3 pu 4 /NH 3 ratio increases and is saturated at 23 at. %.

On the other hand, the Ti-Si-N deposition thickness per cycle, 0.22 nm/cycle, is nearly half the value of TiN ~ 0.44 nm/cycle, shown in Fig. 2As mentioned above, SiHcan-! . 4 not react directly with TDMAT or NHat this MOALD tem3 perature of 180 °C. Thus, SiH can 4 only take part in the Ti-Si-N formation during the reaction between TDMAT and NH 3 . Therefore, when the substrate covered with both TDMAT and SiH 4 is exposed to the NHpulse, the reaction 3 between TDMAT and NH 3 should at first occur on the surface. And then, the SiH adsorbed on the surface could be 4 involved into the Ti-Si-N formation. But, excess SiH 4 would still remain on the surface after the end of the NH 3 pulse and act as a blockade toward the adsorption of TDMAT during the following TDMAT pulse of the next cycle. Consequently, the total quantity of TDMAT and NH 3 that contributes to the film growth during one cycle would be decreased, and it would result in reduction of the Ti-Si-N deposition thickness per cycle.
