To prepare all-solid-state batteries with a sufficient high storage capacity it is vital to prepare high quality thin films for battery stacks on 3D-structuredsubstrates. A remote plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD) process has therefore been developed for LiCoO2 which can serve as acathode material. A combination of CoCp2 as cobalt precursor, LiOtBu as lithium precursor and O2 plasma as oxidant source wasused to create super-cycles to deposit LiCoO2 from Co3O4 and Li2CO3 cycles. The thin films were deposited at a temperature of325?C and showed linear growth with a rate of 0.06 nm/cycle. After annealing the samples at 700?C for 6 minutes high temperaturephase LiCoO2 was obtained, as was demonstrated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. A new procedure was proposed to obtain thecomposition of all three chemical elements in the LiCoO2 films. Elastic Backscattering Spectroscopy (EBS) measurements turned outto be very convenient and reliable to obtain the quantities of all chemical elements, including lithium. Moreover, the ALD-depositedLiCoO2 thin film electrodes were electrochemically characterized, revealing good electrochemical performance.

This was inpart Paper 1848 presented at the Boston, Massachusetts, Meeting of the Society, October 914, 2011. This paper is part of the JESFocus Issue on Intercalation Compounds for Rechargeable Batteries.During the past decade, portable electronic devices have becomeconsiderably more widespread, complex and powerful, and new chal-lenges have been encountered, especially in the field of medical andautonomous devices. To power these future devices, thin-film, all-solid-state, lithium-ion micro-batteries have been proposed.14 To fa-cilitate the required energy demand, both a high energy-to-weightand energy-to-volume ratio is essential. Lithium-ion batteries fulfillthese demands. As packaging requirements become more dominant atsmaller dimensions, one of the remaining challenges is miniaturiza-tion of lithium-ion batteries without decreasing the storage capacity.This formed the basis of the integrated batteries concept.1Step conformal deposition of films onto etched structures in sili-con is an excellent method to tackle this challenge and to facilitate theintegration of these high capacity energy storage devices into micro-electronics.1,2 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been proposedas deposition method.1 However, CVD has a limited step-conformaldeposition capability in highly structured geometries due to the deli-cate interplay between kinetics and diffusion. By using atomic layerdeposition (ALD) this effect can be counteracted as this depositionmethod is based on a reaction-limited surface saturation, opening upnumerous possibilities for the use of more complex substrate struc-tures such as nanowires.5Industrial scale implementation of ALD has already been provenin micro-electronics and this technique is rapidly penetrating newfields, such as solar cells, catalysis and recently also energy storagedevices.1,6,7 In the field of battery technology several interesting mate-rials have been prepared which show much promise.8 However, workon lithium-containing solid-state electrolytes and electrode materi-als is still very exploratory. Even though several lithium-containingcompounds have recently been prepared by ALD,9,10 no reports ofelectrochemical investigations are available to date. An overview ofLi-containing compounds prepared by ALD is presented in Table I.This paper demonstrates the electrochemical activity for ALD-prepared LiCoO2 which is, to the best of our knowledge, the firstactive Li-containing battery material, deposited by ALD, which iselectrochemically characterized in detail. Therefore, for reference,also LiCoO2 CVD processes are included in Table I.?Electrochemical Society Active Member.zE-mail: P.H.L.Notten@tue.nlEvidently, analyzing the chemical composition of thin films isessential to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the LiCoO2.Although it is most uncommon to use backscattering techniques suchas Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) for the determina-tion of the Li content in thin films, this has been achieved by makinguse of non-Rutherford cross sections. The as-obtained results willbe verified by Nuclear Reaction Analyzes (NRA).11 This is anothernovelty within this paper.ExperimentalFilm preparation. The LiCoO2 films were deposited using anopen-load thermal and remote plasma ALD reactor as described pre-viously for the deposition of Co3O4.12 An inductively coupled plasma(ICP) source that is operated on O2 is connected to a deposition cham-ber along with a pump unit through gate valves. The pump unit consistsof a rotary and turbo molecular pump, which can reach a base pres-sure of <10?5 Torr by overnight pumping. The CoCp2 and LiOtBuprecursors (both 98%, Strem Chemicals) were heated to 80?C and120?C respectively (Table II) and they were bubbled with Ar at a re-actor pressure of 0.02 Torr. The substrate was heated to 325?C, whilethe reactor walls, Ar lines, and CoCp2 precursor lines were main-tained at a temperature of 105?C, the LiOtBu precursor lines werekept at 150?C to prevent precursor condensation. Si(100) with nativeoxide and Si(100) with 400 nm thermally grown SiO2 were used assubstrates for materials analyzes. For the electrochemical characteri-zation, Si/TiO2/Pt substrates were prepared by ALD as described inRef. 8 and schematically shown in Fig. 18 with thicknesses of 5 and20 nm for TiO2 and Pt respectively.The remote plasma ALD process for LiCoO2 consists of the twoindividual ALD processes for the deposition of Co3O4 and Li2CO3which are combined in a so-called super-cycle (Fig. 2). Here the pre-viously described remote plasma ALD process for Co3O4 is combinedwith a novel ALD process, using a lithium precursor reported recentlyfor the deposition of LLT and Li2CO3.9,10 In this paper a super-cycleis defined as a combination of A cycles Co3O4 and B cycles Li2CO3(Fig. 2), resulting in a dosing ratio of A:B (e.g. 4:1), where B is con-sistently kept as 1 throughout the paper. x is defined as A/B, e.g. for adosing ratio of 4:1, x equals 4. In both processes a precursor dosingtime of 2 s is applied combined with an O2 plasma at 100 W for 5 sJournal of The Electrochemical Society, 160 (5) A3066-A3071 (2013) A3067Table I.

During and after the precursor dosing andplasma exposure, the reaction chamber is purged (3 s and 0.5 s re-spectively) and evacuated.Film analyzes. The thickness and dielectric function of the filmswere monitored during the ALD process by in situ spectroscopic el-lipsometry (SE) with a J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000U (0.755.0 eV)ellipsometer.13 The optical range was extended to 6.5 eV after thedeposition process, using ex situ variable angle measurements with aJ.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000D ellipsometer. The dielectric function ofCo3O4 has been extracted from the SE measurements using an opticalmodel employing a Gauss, a TaucLorentz, and two Lorentz oscilla-tors, to account for the absorption bands.12 The dielectric functionsof Li2CO3 and LiCoO2 were parameterized using a mathematical de-scription in the form of B-splines.14 This is a method that requires noprior knowledge about the dielectric function of deposited films andenables in situ thickness measurements.The microstructure of the LiCoO2 films was studied using Graz-ing Incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) with a Philips XPert MPDdiffractometer equipped with a Cu K? source (1.54 Å radiation). TheRaman spectra of the samples were recorded using a (in-via Ren-ishaw) micro Raman scattering setup with a wavelength of 514.5 nm,a maximum power density of 3.2 · 105 W/cm2 and a resolution of1.6 cm?1.The overall composition of the layers has been analyzed at AccTecBV15 with backscattering spectrometry using a 2.09 MeV proton beamdelivered and a scattering angle of 172?. Under these circumstancesthe cross sections of the lighter elements are strongly enhanced withrespect to the Rutherford cross sections and strictly spoken the tech-nique should be referred to as Elastic Backscattering (EBS) insteadof RBS. The enhancement for the cross sections of 7Li, 12C, 16O withrespect to the Rutherford values is about 55, 5 and 4 respectively. Themain advantage is that all elements can now be determined from onesingle spectrum. The alpha yield was simultaneously measured fromthe 7Li(p,?)4He nuclear reaction to confirm the Li content with NRA.The Co, O and C concentrations have been confirmed with conven-tional RBS measurements using 2 MeV He+ ions. More details of theEBS analysis will be published in a separate paper.11Electrochemical analyzes. The electrochemical analyzes wereperformed in three-electrode cylindrical electrochemical cells with aneffective surface area of 2 cm2 (Fig. 1). The cells were made of Teflonwith a volume of about 15 ml. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove-box. The Si/TiO2/Pt/LiCoO2 electrodes were mounted asworking electrodes and back-contacted, and in direct contact withLiCoO2, with silver paint to facilitate good electrical conductivity. ACu plate was used as electrical conductor for the working electrode,while pure lithium foils were used as counter and reference electrodes.1 molar LiClO4 dissolved in Ethyl Carbonate (EC)/Diethyl Carbonate(DEC) was used as liquid electrolyte (Puriel, Techno, Semichem Co.,Ltd, Korea). The cells were placed in a stainless steel holder that wasthermostatically controlled at room temperature. Contaminants in theglove-box (water and oxygen) were monitored and controlled below1 ppm. Galvanostatic cycling was performed with a M2300 galvanos-tat (Maccor, Tulsa, USA), applying a current density of 0.5 ?Ah/cm2between 3.0 and 4.1 V. The following definition is adopted through-out the manuscript: charging LiCoO2 refers to Li-ion extraction (ordelithiation) and discharging to Li-ion insertion (or lithiation). Basedon the electrode surface area, the layer thickness as determined byspectroscopic ellipsometry and the density determined by quantita-tive EBS measurements (Table III), the volumetric and gravimetriccapacities were calculated.Figure 1.

The LiCoO2 films under investigation deposited on Si/TiO2/Ptsubstrates are used as working electrode during the electrochemical measure-ments. Layer thicknesses are 5 and 20 nm for TiO2 and Pt respectively.A3068 Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 160 (5) A3066-A3071 (2013)Figure 2.

The film-substratestack is also shown.Results and DiscussionALD growth. To investigate the ALD process parameters, theself-limiting behavior of the ALD process was investigated for theCoCp2 and LiOtBu precursors using a Co:Li dosing ratio of 1:1 for thesuper-cycle as presented in Fig. 2. This means that one cycle of Co3O4was alternated with one cycle of Li2CO3. The plasma exposure timewas fixed at 5 seconds for both precursors. The Li precursor dosingtime was varied while the Co dosing time remained constant at 2 s,which is the same dosing time used during the deposition of Co3O4.12Saturation of the Li precursor occurs after about 2 s as can be seenin Fig. 3a. The same procedure was conducted for the Co precursorwhile the Li dosing time was kept constant at 2 s. Proper saturation isalso observed in the Co case (Fig. 3b). Note that the growth rates undersaturated conditions are slightly different in Fig. 3a and 3b. This canmost likely be attributed to the different film thicknesses employedwhen generating Fig. 3a and 3b. the growth rate was found the change0 1 2 30.000.050.100.15Growth per cycle (nm)Li precursor dosing time (s)a0 1 2 30.000.050.100.15bGrowth per cycle (nm)Co precursor dosing time (s)Figure 3.

Dosing times of 2 s forboth precursors were therefore fixed for all deposition experimentsdescribed.Applying a Co:Li dosing ratio of 1:1 lead to a slightly higher growthrate than expected on the basis of the individual growth rates for Co3O4(0.05 nm/cycle) and Li2CO3 (0.08 nm/cycle). This could be due to thehigh growth rate of pure Li2CO3 as compared to pure Co3O4,9,12 butTable III. Material properties and electrochemical results for LiCoO2 thin films prepared for various Co/Li dosing ratios. Compositions aremeasured by EBS. The Co/Li dosing ratio (x) for the ALD process is defined as the number of Co3O4 sub-cycles divided by the number of Li2CO3sub-cycles. For the lithium concentration an average is taken of the EBS and NRA measurements.

Thickness of LiCoO2 on Si(100) as a function of the number ofALD super-cycles, as measured with in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. Theused Co:Li dosing ratio is 4:1.the growth of Li2CO3 could also be catalyzed by the presence of cobaltatoms. Fig. 4 shows that the thickness was almost linearly dependenton the number of ALD cycles at a dosing ratio of Co:Li = 4:1 with anoverall growth rate of ?0.06 nm/cycle. It is not expected that a changein Co:Li dosing ratio will significantly affect the saturation behaviorfor both precursors in the Co3O4 and Li2CO3 cycles.Fig. 5 shows the in situ measured dielectric function ?2 for photonenergies between 1.24 and 6.5 eV of the as-deposited Co3O4, Li2CO3and LiCoO2. A clear difference is found between the three films.The dielectric function of Co3O4 has been described in an earlierpublication.12 Unfortunately, from the literature not much is knownabout the dielectric functions of Li2CO3 and LiCoO2. In order todistinguish between Co3O4, Li2CO3 and LiCoO2 the films of thelatter two materials have also been investigate. Fig. 5 clearly showsthat Li2CO3 hardly contributes to the LiCoO2 signal and that a typicalspectrum for LiCoO2 is obtained.Material properties. Knowledge of the overall film compositionis essential in order to evaluate ALD-deposited LiCoO2 thin films,especially to properly evaluate the electrochemical results. EBS andNRA are excellent techniques to determine the atomic composition ofcompounds and can thus be used to reveal the ratio between lithium,cobalt and oxygen in the films (Fig. 6).11 These analyzes show thatmaterials prepared with a Co:Li dosing ratio x of 4 and higher havemore or less the same atomic ratios (Table III). In addition, a Co:Lidosing ratio larger than 4:1 seems to increase the deposition rate ofthe lithium sub-cycle in the ALD process slightly (Fig. 6), while thedeposition rate during the cobalt sub-cycle is unaffected and continuesto increase linearly with x. This effect is not yet fully understood, butlimits the ALD process from obtaining the desired Co/Li = 1 materialcomposition for the range investigated. This illustrates the delicatebalance that needs to be taken into account when dealing with theALD-deposition of ternary compounds.1 2 3 4 5 6 70246Li2CO3Co3O4LiCoO2Dielectric function ? 2Photon energy (eV)Figure 5.

Number of atoms deposited per nm2 per super-cycle and the Co/Liratio in the film as a function of the Co/Li dosing ratio (x) as determinedby Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and Elastic backscattering spectroscopy(EBS). For the Co/Li dosing ratio the amount of Li cycles per super-cycle iskept constant at 1.As-deposited samples were investigated by GI-XRD and Ramanspectroscopy and subsequently annealed at 700?C for 6 minutes be-fore being measured again with the same techniques. Fig. 7 showsthat a large diffraction peak becomes visible after annealing at a 2?angle of 19?, which has also been reported in the literature for metalorganic (MO) CVD deposited LiCoO2 at various temperatures.16 Thispeak can be assigned to either the (111) reflection of Co3O4 or the(003) reflection of LiCoO2. As both cobalt oxide and lithium cobaltoxide can be present in the deposited thin films it is not possible tounambiguously determine the origin of the diffraction peak and thenature of the film from XRD. Therefore Raman spectroscopy hasbeen used to further investigate these films. Figure 8 shows that thehigh temperature (HT) hexagonal phase of LiCoO2 is observed withtwo typical phonon modes at 486 and 596 cm?1 which becomes evenmore defined after annealing.17 The Raman spectra reveal no signif-icant fraction of Co3O4 in the films as this would lead to a distinctpeak at 693 cm?1.Electrochemical analyzes. It is well-known that a heat-treatmentof about 700?C is required to obtain the electrochemically active, crys-talline, LiCoO2.18 The annealed LiCoO2 films were electrochemicallycharacterized in the experimental three-electrode battery set-up usingFigure 7.

The spectra have been offset verticallyfor clarity. The Co:Li dosing ratio was 2:1 (x = 2).A3070 Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 160 (5) A3066-A3071 (2013)Figure 8.

Theused Co:Li dosing ratio was 2:1 (x = 2).constant current (dis)charge cycling. The charge transfer reaction ofthe LiCoO2 electrode can be represented byLiCoO2  Li(1?z)CoO2 + z Li+ + z e? (z ? 0.5) [1]where z ? 0.5. Extracting more than 0.5 lithium atoms per formulaunit would irreversibly change the crystal structure of LiCoO2, makingthe electrode (partly) electrochemically inactive.20 All electrode filmsinvestigated showed electrochemical activity. However, the storagecapacity was clearly found to be dependent on the ALD dosing ratio.Fig. 9a shows the (dis)charge behavior of the LiCoO2 electrodefor the Co:Li dosing ratio x of 4 which revealed the highest storagecapacity. By taking the derivate of the storage capacity with respectto the electrode potential (Fig. 9b), the plateaus in Fig. 9a are trans-formed into either broad or sharp peaks dependent on the slope ofthe voltage curves. A clear charge transfer reaction is now visible at3.9 V as expected for LiCoO2.18,21 Also a 12% capacity loss betweenthe charge and discharge reactions is found (Fig. 9a). A similar effecthas been reported before19 and this has been attributed to irreversibleside reactions (e.g. oxidation of the liquid electrolyte,22 the formationof the less electrochemically active spinel LiCo2O4 phase23 or me-chanical strain-induced degradation of the LiCoO2 film,24 but also the(electro)chemical stability of the impurities found in ALD LiCoO2with respect to the liquid electrolyte could play a role.The electrochemical storage capacity is, however, lower than the-oretically expected for LiCoO2 (155 mAh/g),18 but remained fairlystable upon cycling as shown in Fig. 9c. Over 60% of the maximumtheoretical storage capacity has been obtained with the ALD deposited(x = 4) thin film electrode (Fig. 9c). This lower capacity can be ex-plained by the presence of Li2CO3 within the thin film as indicated bythe increased oxygen over cobalt (O/Co) and decreased cobalt overlithium (Co/Li) ratios and the presence of carbon (Table III). More-over Table III shows an abundance of lithium and oxygen which couldalso indicate the formation of inactive Li2O during the ALD process.These two effects may contribute to the reduced capacity comparedto the theoretical maximum. Referring to Table III it is clear that theimpurity level of the x = 2 material is significantly higher than the x= 4 material. This is in line with the reduced capacity of the x = 2material compared to x = 4. It is expected that further process op-timization will yield a higher chemical purity and improved storagecapacity.ConclusionsA remote plasma ALD process for the preparation of LiCoO2 thinfilms was developed using the combination of CoCp2 as cobalt pre-cursor, LiOtBu as lithium precursor and a O2 plasma as the oxidant0 5 100102030Co/Li (x) = 2 Capacity (mAh/g)Co/Li (x) = 4Capacity (µAh µm-1  cm-2)(Dis)charge cycles(c)(b)(a)050100Figure 9.

To the best of our knowledge this paper provides the first evi-dence that electrochemically active LiCoO2 can be deposited by ALD.It was shown that LiCoO2 films could be deposited by ALD with theLi/Co ratio depending on the Co:Li dosing ratio. Moreover elasticbackscattering spectrometry was shown to be an accurate method toanalyze the Li-content in this type of films, which simplifies the anal-ysis significantly. After heat-treatment the high temperature phase ofLiCoO2 was obtained as shown by XRD and Raman measurements.Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 160 (5) A3066-A3071 (2013) A3071Electrochemical charge/discharge cycling experiments showed goodreversible electrochemical performance with a significant fraction(60%) of active material for the annealed LiCoO2 films, revealingthat ALD is a promising method to deposit active lithium-containingelectrode materials.AcknowledgmentsThis research was carried out under the project number MC3.06278in the framework of the Research Program of the Materials innovationinstitute M2i (www.m2i.nl).References1.
