Published May 10, 2014. This was Paper 1857presented at the San Francisco, California, Meeting of the Society, October 27November 1, 2013.Lead chalcogenides such as PbTe, PbSe and PbS have attractedconsiderable attention over the past few years because of their superioroptical, electrical and mechanical properties. The efficiency of a ther-moelectric material is determined by the dimensionless thermoelectricfigure of merit, ZT = ?S2T/?, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, ?is the electrical conductivity, and ? is the thermal conductivity.1 Thethermal conductivity actually is consisting from electron and phononcontributions ? = ? e + ?p.2 To improve upon the ZT, the Seebeckcoefficient and electrical conductivity must increase, whereas the ther-mal conductivity ? must decrease. The ZT of the material is related tothe efficiency of the TE device,? = ? (1 + Z T )1/2 ? 1(1 + Z T )1/2 + Thot/Tcoldwhere ? is the Carnot efficiency and Thot and Tcold are temperatures(in K) of the hot and cold side of the TE material.By using ALD, such ZT improvement can be achieved, because itis possible to modulate the materials properties at the nanoscale level,which constitutes a low dimensional structure. The characteristics ofbulk materials are different from that of thin films for every material.By ALD deposition of alternating PbTe and PbSe thin films we areable to create superlattice (SL) structures. These structures may sig-nificantly enhance ZT as the electrons were confined to move in twodimensions. In addition, the improvement of ZT is resulted from thefact that the interfaces between layers in the superlattice structurescould increase the phonon scattering and consequently decrease thephonon thermal conductivity. Low dimensional material systems35were shown to exhibit significantly higher ZT values than that in bulkmaterials. In bulk thermoelectric materials the quantities S, ?, and? are interrelated in such a way as to make independent control ofthese variables to increase ZT very difficult. However, this correla-tion between S, ?, and ? is not maintained in materials with reduceddimensionality, such as quantum wells (superlattices), quantum wires?Electrochemical Society Active Member.??Electrochemical Society Student Member.zE-mail: hbaumgar@odu.eduand quantum dots, where introduction of a new variable (length scale)permits decoupling of the aforementioned parameters and allows themto be optimized simultaneously.PbTe is a useful narrow bandgap thermoelectric material thatcan operate at comparatively higher temperatures in the range of600?850 K due to its better chemical stability and high meltingpoint.6,7 PbTe and PbSe present a good choice for thermoelectricenergy harvesting devices, especially in the automobile sector andpower plants, if its thermoelectric efficiency ZT can be significantlyimproved. The state-of-the-art power generation efficiency of ther-moelectric devices is currently approximately 12%. The heat wastedin many machines could thus be converted into useful renewable en-ergy and thereby contribute to reducing global warming and reducingpollution by saving gasoline in automobiles. Besides, this materialcan also be used in infrared imaging applications or cooling devices.Although various deposition techniques like Molecular Beam Epi-taxy (MBE),8 Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD),9 RF magnetronsputtering,10 Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD)11 and ElectrochemicalALD (E-ALD)12,13 have been applied in the past for thermoelectricmaterials, very little is known about the potential of ALD synthesisof PbTe and PbSe. ALD is considered a promising method to synthe-size PbTe/PbSe nanolaminate structures. Atomic Layer Depositiontechnology has numerous advantages over conventional thin film de-position techniques. It can precisely control the film layer thickness,the stoichiometry, the composition, the uniformity, and produce sharpinterfaces in nanolaminate structures. ALD is a self-limiting surfacesaturating atomic layer reaction and can also be used to deposit con-formal films onto very complex structures. In general ALD has beenshown to be able to generate reproducible and well-defined nanolam-inate structures.14,15 In this study the relatively new thermal ALDtechnology has been used for the first time for PbTe and PbSe thinfilm synthesis.ExperimentalThe PbTe films were grown on a Si (100) wafer coveredwith native oxide by ALD using lead(II)bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-) unless CC License in place (see abstract).  ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

The na-tive oxide surface was exposed to H2O vapor before ALD PbTe orPbSe thin film deposition to ensure a hydroxyl group (OH?) termi-nated native oxide surface, which aids the reproducible chemisorptionof the ALD precursor compounds. The ALD experiments were carriedout by thermal ALD in a cross-flow reactor from Cambridge Nanotech.For our experiments, 20 sccm N2 was used as a carrier gas for the pre-cursors. This carrier gas flow enabled proper transport of precursorsfrom the precursor cylinder to the reaction chamber. The growth tem-perature during ALD varied at a range from 150?C to 250?C. Thelead precursor was volatilized at a temperature of 140?C and the Teprecursor was heated at 40?C. The Se precursor was not heated as ithad enough vapor pressure at room temperature. The chamber basepressure was kept at 40 mTorr. The ALD PbTe and PbSe film samplesare listed in Table I and Table II, respectively. Table I shows the rangeof the experimental ALD parameter settings for PbTe thin film de-position that were systematically varied and compared for this study.Table II shows the same for PbSe films.Several physical characterization techniques have been employedto determine the ALD PbTe and PbSe thin film characteristics. Thecrystal structure and phase purity of samples of PbTe and PbSe filmswere analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The film morphology andstructure of the products were determined by field emission scanningelectron microscopy (FE-SEM) and scanning transmission electronmicroscopy (S TEM). The TEM characterization was performed ona FEI Titan 80300 aberration corrected microscope at an operatingvoltage of 300 kV. Lamellae for the TEM studies were prepared using afocused ion beam (FIB) system (FEI Strata 400S). The samples werecovered with carbon deposition before the FIB milling. Elementalmapping was carried out in STEM mode with an energy-dispersiveX-ray detector.Results and DiscussionThe deposition of PbTe and PbSe thin film nanolaminates wascarried over a wide range of temperatures on the Si (100) wafer coveredwith native oxide. The reaction involved between the precursors forPbTe is shown below:16Pb(C11H19O2)2 (g)+(Me3Si)2Te (g)=PbTe (s)+2Me3SiC11H19O2(g)Pb(C11H19O2)2 (g)+(Et3Si)2Se (g)=PbSe (s)+2Et3SiC11H19O2(g)In our study, deposition temperatures from below 150?C to 250?Cwere investigated and an ALD process window was established forPbTe. The various ALD pulse durations for these experiments are pro-vided in Table I. In order to experimentally establish the ALD processwindow numerous ALD PbTe films deposited at different tempera-tures starting below 150?C, 170?C, 190?C, 210?C, 230?C and 250?Cwere studied by FE-SEM to study the resulting crystallization qualityand film morphologies. At very low temperatures below 150?C, nofilm deposition at all was observed and thus establishes the processcliff at the lower temperature end. This is attributed to the precur-sor molecules not having sufficient energy to interact and chemisorbwith the substrate surface. The PbTe thin film coverage diminishessignificantly with increasing ALD deposition temperature. This effectis especially apparent for the highest ALD deposition temperature at250?C, where practically no PbTe film was detected but only a few iso-lated PbTe islands were remaining. At high surface temperatures over210?C, this loss in PbTe material may be either due to decompositionTable II. Experimental details of process development for ALD PbSe films.Sample Precursor Temp.

Based on numerous experimentalALD runs, it was observed that the optimum temperature range forthe process window was from 170?C to 190?C, where a stable ALDgrowth rate of 0.25 Å/ cycle was achieved. At this temperature, goodnucleation and smoother surfaces were obtained with good overallcoverage. Also different precursor pulse times were investigated andfinally the optimum pulse time was chosen by studying the ALD filmmorphologies from Field Emission SEM images obtained. Some ofthe representative FE-SEM images obtained for the PbTe and PbSethin films are shown in Figure 1.As seen from the FE-SEM images of Figure 2, the surface cov-erage improves with an increase in the number of cycles. It is alsoclear from the images obtained that the growth does not follow theclassical growth mode of monolayer upon monolayer which is nor-mally expected from ALD but follows an island growth mode. Theappearance of Volmer-Weber growth mode instead of Frank-Van derMerwe can be primarily attributed to dominant atom-to-atom interac-tion and to the presence of unevenly distributed nucleation sites on thenative oxide and the elevated ALD temperature that causes polycrys-talline ALD PbTe and PbSe deposition instead of amorphous films.These nucleation sites may be dangling bonds or microscopic surfacedefects. The Volmer-Weber mode is accompanied by heterogeneousnucleation where atom-to-atom interaction dominates over atom-to-surface interaction. As this process gets repeated over and over forevery ALD cycle, the islands grow in size with the smaller islandsgetting consumed by the bigger ones and they finally conglomerateto form clusters.17 Finally, as the island conglomerates grow largeenough, they cover the entire substrate surface in a randomly orientedpolycrystalline structure. This phenomenon can be clearly understoodby observing the images shown in Figure 1. It is noted that the four biggrains visible in Figure 1c are uncharacterized defects, which are notrepresentative. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images shown in Figure 2further prove this concept and a growth rate of ?0.25 Å/cycle hasbeen deduced for PbTe. It was also observed that ALD PbSe filmsgrew at a faster growth rate and exhibit a better surface coverage withhigher nucleation density compared to the ALD PbTe case. The islandFigure 2.

The reduced dimensional structures couldgreatly improve the thermoelectric ZT due to the effects of confine-ment on the electronic density of state and enhancement of the phononscattering at multiple interface boundaries.The TEM images obtained for PbTe thin films help us in under-standing the microstructure of the PbTe ALD films and the interfacewith Si substrate. It gives an idea about the structure, texture andcrystalline information of the thin film. Figure 3a and 3b show theTEM cross-sectional images of ALD PbTe crystallites nucleated onthe Si substrates. These TEM images further revealed that the dom-inant growth mode of PbTe films follows the Volmer-Weber islandgrowth. This growth mechanism eventually results in the formation ofnumerous isolated PbTe crystallites. The TEM cross-sectional micro-graphs delineating the polycrystalline texture of the synthesized PbTedemonstrate that the ALD growth temperature of 170?C lies abovethe crystallization temperature of PbTe.To determine the crystal structure, grain size and stoichiometry,additional characterizations like X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and EnergyDispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) were performed for the ALD PbTeand PbSe films. Figure 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of ALDFigure 4. X-ray diffraction patterns of ALD (a) PbTe thin films for 2000cycles (sample # PbTe-10) and PbSe thin films for 6000 cycles (sample #PbSe-13) prepared at 170?C, respectively.(a) PbTe thin films for 2000 cycles and PbSe thin films for 6000 cy-cles prepared at 170?C, respectively. The XRD pattern proves that bothPbTe and PbSe films have face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure.XRD measurements show that the growth direction is predominantlyalong the cubic (200) crystallographic orientation although other ori-entations are also present. This is due to the lower interface energyalong the (200) direction when compared to the others. It can also beobserved that the peak intensity in XRD becomes sharp and strongespecially along (200) orientation, this is attribute to that highly crys-talline structure can be obtained with longer heating time and highernumber of cycles. The lattice parameter of the ALD PbTe thin filmswere calculated using the formula 1/d2 = (h2 + k2 + l2)/a2, whered is the interplanar distance, h, k, and l are the Miller Indices, and ais the lattice parameter. Based on the (200) crystallographic planes,the lattice parameter is a = 6.440 Å, which closely matches the ref-erence value of a = 6.438 nm. The lattice parameter of the ALDPbSe films is a = 6.126 Å (the reference value of a = 6.128 Å forPbSe).Figure 5 shows the results of high-angle annular dark-field(HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy image with thecorresponding elemental maps through an energy-dispersive spec-trometer (EDS) for Pb and Se of PbSe ALD films and for Pb andTe of PbTe ALD films. It is observed that both Pb and Se sig-nals are detected. It also reveals that the elemental distribution isuniform through the whole cross-section in the samples of PbSeand PbTe films as shown in Figure 5. STEM-EDS elemental map-ping and EDS spectra measurement demonstrate that PbSe and PbTethin films were successfully synthesized by atomic layer depositiontechnology.All these characterizations confirm the formation of PbTe thinfilms by atomic layer deposition. PbSe thin films also have almostthe same characteristics. The complete physical characterization forPbSe and the nanolaminate superlattice structure is work in progress.However, we have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of thebasic unit cell of superlattice structures by growing double layersof alternating PbTe and PbSe ALD films. In our experiments wehave grown superlattice structures with 5000 ALD cycles of PbTeand another 4000 cycles of PbSe on top of it. Figure 6 providesproof of concept that nanolaminate superlattice structures with com-plete coverage of the underlying substrate are feasible. In the fu-ture this can be repeated n-times for the fabrication of thermoelectricdevices.Figure 7 shows the HAADF-STEM image with the correspondingEDS elemental maps for Pb, Te and Se of PbTe/PbSe ALD nanolam-inates.

During the nucleation phase, lasting atleast a few hundred cycles, the individual ALD PbTe and PbSe thinfilms establish a Volmer-Weber type of island growth pattern. Theoptimized ALD deposition temperature window appears to lie in therange of 170?C to 210?C for PbTe and PbSe, which produced relativelysmoother polycrystalline thin films of both the compounds.In addition, we have identified the considerable surface textureroughness resulting from Volmer-Weber island growth mode. ThusPbTe and PbSe nanolaminates have the potential to serve in thermo-electric applications if further optimized. More research and devel-opment is needed for process optimization to achieve smoother ALDfilms and good surface coverage with lower number of deposition cy-cles. Progress is being made to obtain better thermoelectric efficien-cies by decreasing the thermal conductivity ? and achieving promisingSeebeck measurements. This can contribute to energy savings glob-ally if translated into energy harvesting thermoelectric devices in thefuture.AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by the US Air Force Office of ScientificResearch (AFOSR) under subcontract No. 01_AFOSRTE2 and PrimeFigure 6.
