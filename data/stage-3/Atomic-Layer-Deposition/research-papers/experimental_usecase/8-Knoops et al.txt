Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven,The Netherlands2Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology, North End, Bristol BS49 4AP, United Kingdom(Received 5 May 2015; accepted 25 June 2015; published online 7 July 2015)The requirements on the material properties and growth control of silicon nitride (SiNx) spacerfilms in transistors are becoming ever more stringent as scaling of transistor structures continues.One method to deposit high-quality films with excellent control is atomic layer deposition (ALD).However, depositing SiNx by ALD has turned out to be very challenging. In this work, it is shownthat the plasma gas residence time s is a key parameter for the deposition of SiNx by plasma-assisted ALD and that this parameter can be linked to a so-called redeposition effect. This previ-ously ignored effect, which takes place during the plasma step, is the dissociation of reaction prod-ucts in the plasma and the subsequent redeposition of reaction-product fragments on the surface.For SiNx ALD using SiH2(NHtBu)2 as precursor and N2 plasma as reactant, the gas residence times was found to determine both SiNx film quality and the resulting growth per cycle. It is shown thatredeposition can be minimized by using a short residence time resulting in high-quality films witha high wet-etch resistance (i.e., a wet-etch rate of 0.5 nm/min in buffered HF solution). Due to thefundamental nature of the redeposition effect, it is expected to play a role in many more plasma-assisted ALD processes. VC 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4926366]Silicon nitride (SiNx) is one of the most widely usedthin-film materials in many areas such as semiconductortechnology, photovoltaics, and displaysdue to its uniquecombination of optical, electrical, mechanical, and chemicalproperties.1 One of its key applications in semiconductortechnology is as spacer films in transistors where the SiNxserves multiple roles such as a barrier film and masking ma-terial. For this application, the requirement of uniform mate-rial quality and film thickness throughout the device,independent of transistor pitch, is becoming ever more rigor-ous as miniaturization of the transistor structures continues.One method to deposit high-quality thin films with excellentcontrol is atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, despitethe many advances in ALD, depositing SiNx by ALD hasturned out to be very challenging.16 This is especially thecase when low impurity levels and low wet-etch rates arerequired, combined with the need to be deposited at low sub-strate temperatures (<400 C) from halide-free precursors.1Similar as for other nitride ALD processes, plasmas can beused during the reactant step to increase the surface reactiv-ity.7 Nonetheless, even with the high reactivity of theplasma, long plasma times are required to avoid high impu-rity contents. Other process parameters which are generallyidentified as key for ALD of nitrides are the substrate tem-perature and the plasma gas pressure.7 However, little isknown about the underlying physical processes that deter-mine the film quality. Hence, research efforts are carried outto identify the most important parameters and underlyingprocesses and to find routes towards better nitride ALDprocesses.In this letter, we will show that the gas residence time sduring the plasma step is a key parameter for depositinghigh-quality SiNx by plasma-assisted ALD and that this pa-rameter can be linked to the so-called redeposition effect.This effect is the dissociation in the plasma of reaction prod-ucts released from the surface and the subsequent redeposi-tion of reaction-product fragments on the surface. Thesefragments can be incorporated in the film, increasing impu-rity levels and affecting the growth of the SiNx films. Due toits general nature, it is expected that the redeposition effectis of significance for a wide range of plasma-assisted ALDprocesses.The SiNx ALD process used in this work employedSiH2(NHtBu)2 (BTBAS) as precursor and N2 plasma as reac-tant. The details of the process will be reported in a separatepublication,8 and therefore, only the general characteristicsare discussed here. Briefly, the depositions were carried outusing a remote plasma ALD reactor (Oxford InstrumentsFlexALVR).9 The precursor SiH2(NHtBu)2 (BTBAS, purity98.5%, Air Products Inc.) was held at a bubbler temperatureof 50 C and vapor drawn into the reactor. The reactor wasequipped with a remote inductively coupled (ICP) plasmagenerator, which was operated at 600 W at 13.56 MHz usingN2 (purity 99.9999%) and Ar (purity 99.999%) as plasmagasses. A butterfly valve controlled the effective pumpingspeed. During precursor dosing and the subsequent reactionstep, this valve was set to 10 to maximize precursor usage.During purging steps, the valve was set to 90 valve positionfor maximum pumping. Based on the saturation curves deter-mined for precursor dose and plasma exposure,8 the followingrecipe was chosen as a standard: 1 s delivery line purge,150 ms BTBAS dose time, 3 s reaction time, 1 s precursorpurge time, 2 s pre-plasma time, 10 s plasma exposure timea)Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed.

The experiments were carried out at varioussubstrate table temperatures ranging from 200 C up to400 C.To first understand the general behavior of the SiNx ALDprocess, the material properties as a function of temperatureand plasma conditions are considered as shown in Table I.All conditions result in SiNx films with some C, O, and Himpurities. There is a small decrease in C and H content withplasma exposure time for deposition at 200 C. Deposition ata lower pressure of 13 mTorr instead of 40 mTorr shows thata decrease in plasma pressure can further improve the mate-rial properties although there is still a measurable C impuritycontent. At a high table temperature of 400 C, the propertiesare closest to those of low impurity, stoichiometric siliconnitride. Next, we will illustrate how the persistence of the Ccontent at a deposition temperature of 200 C is caused bydissociation of reaction products in the plasma, and redeposi-tion of C-containing species onto the surface.The first indication of redeposition comes from the opti-cal emission from the plasma during the ALD cycle. Duringthe plasma step, the plasma not only consists of the feed gasbut also of reaction products released from the surface.These reaction products will be dissociated in the plasma aslong as they are present. This can be observed in Fig. 1(a)which shows that the plasma feedstock species yield a rela-tively constant emission signal while the signal from the dis-sociated reaction products (e.g., CN emission) is time-dependent. The fragments of the reaction products can rede-posit on the surface as illustrated by the schematic in Fig.1(b). The time for interaction between the reaction productsand the plasma depends on the gas residence time s, which isa measure of how long species remain in the reaction cham-ber before being flushed out. The residence time is given bythe expression s¼V/q, where V is the effective volume ofthe reactor and q is the volumetric flow rate through that vol-ume (or effective pumping speed).10 The larger q, the fasterspecies are flushed out of the reactor. The presence of CNemission and also the presence of species, such as HCN,C3H8, and C2N2 (not shown) as measured by mass spectrom-etry, show the interaction of the plasma with the reactionproducts and the formation of new species. Note that redepo-sition processes and removal of redeposition from the sur-face are continuous. Species that redeposit on the surface canbe again removed by the plasma, but once in the plasma,they can again dissociate and redeposit as long as they arenot flushed out.A similar effect was proposed in our previous work forplasma-assisted ALD of TaNx using Ta(NMe)5 as precursorand H2 plasma as reactant.11 For this process, a slow removalof C impurities from the film during the plasma exposureTABLE I.

(b) Schematic illustration of the redeposition process. During theplasma exposure step, precursor ligands are liberated from the surface andenter the gas phase. These reaction products can dissociate in the plasma (e.g.,by electron impact) leading to reactive species which can redeposit on the sur-face. The extent of the redeposition will depend on the gas residence time s.014102-2 Knoops, de Peuter, and Kessels Appl. Phys.

In these experiments, s was varied by chang-ing the total gas flow and the set pressure (controlled by thebutterfly valve). High gas flows were achieved by adding Arto the N2 plasma gas. A clear effect of redeposition isexpected at 200 C where a change in plasma pressureshowed a large difference in refractive index as was shownin Table I. Figure 2(a) shows that for films deposited at200 C using 10 s plasma exposure and with various total gasflows and gas pressures, the refractive index increases withdecreasing s. Note that other effects associated with lowpressure, such as a change in energy of ions impinging onthe surface, appear secondary to the effect of low residencetime and do not show a one-to-one influence on the refractiveindex. For instance, a pressure of 20 mTorr at a gas flow of40 sccm leads to a lower refractive index than 40 mTorr at100 sccm, even though the ion energies will be higher at 20mTorr. Apparently, the ions, with energies estimated at<15 eV for the entire pressure range, have a much smallereffect than the residence time.7,12 A similar trend with s canbe observed for the impurity levels for films deposited at400 C as shown in Fig. 2(b), even though the effect on re-fractive index is relatively small at this temperature (data notshown). Here, both the oxygen and carbon impurity levelsdecrease monotonically with decreasing s, while the materialproperties do not show a clear dependence on pressure. Notethat besides the faster removal of redepositing species atshort s values, also the faster removal of background impur-ities could contribute to lower oxygen levels. For instance,background water released from the reactor walls is removedfaster at short s values, leading to lower water levels duringthe plasma exposure. The improvement of the material qual-ity at short s values can have a direct influence on the appli-cation of these films. Figure 2(c) shows for instance that thewet-etch rates of the films correlate clearly with s. The wet-etch rate is a key parameter for several applications of ALDSiNx films including the application of SiNx as spacer materi-als in transistors.13Another consequence of the redeposition can beobserved for the growth per cycle (GPC), especially for mod-erate to low temperatures where refractive index and film pu-rity are affected most. Figure 3(a) shows that the growth percycle (GPC) at 200 C shows an unusual trend as a functionFIG. 2.

First, there is a rapid increase inGPC and then a slow decrease. When comparing curves forplasmas with different s values, it becomes clear that theovershoot in GPC can be assigned to redeposition. The con-tribution by redeposition decreases when using lower s val-ues, and the effective rate of removal of the redeposition (thedecrease of the GPC after the overshoot) is faster as well.The trend of the GPC with plasma exposure time can be fit-ted with a relatively simple two-term exponential decayfunction,10 where the first part (A) of the function can beassigned to the normal ALD behavior during the plasma ex-posure step (i.e., creation of reactive sites for precursoradsorption), and the second part (B) of the function can beassigned to redeposition (i.e., the combined effect of redepo-sition of dissociated species and the subsequent removalagain from the surface by the plasma). As expected, forlower s values this component B is strongly reduced becauseless redeposition takes place under these conditions in thefirst place. When the GPC curves are fitted for three s values,the resulting time constants can be plotted as a function of s(Fig. 3(b)). The time constant of component A does notdepend on s, while the time constant of component Bincreases linearly with s, which is directly in agreement withthe mechanism illustrated by the schematic of Fig. 1(b). Thismeans that the rate of the redeposition component scaleswith s. The time constant of component A, in turn, purelydepends on the flux of reactive species. Note that one has toconsider changes in plasma parameters when varying the res-idence time. The fact that tA is constant shows that ourmethod of varying s (adding gas and changing pumpingspeed) has minimal effect on initial saturation and thereforeon the flux of reactive species. In general, the effect of s onthe GPC as function of plasma exposure shows that redeposi-tion processes make the resulting film thickness more de-pendent on the received flux of reactive species. Therefore,even after initial saturation (described by component A), var-iations in flux over the wafer and in trench structures canhave an effect on film uniformity and conformality due toredeposition.In conclusion, redeposition has been identified as a keyprocess for plasma-assisted ALD of SiNx determining boththe film growth and the material quality. Redeposition canbe controlled by the gas residence time s during the plasmastep as it directly determines how fast the reaction productsare flushed out of the reactor. The faster the reaction prod-ucts are flushed out, the less chance they have that they rede-posit on the surface. This will generally lead to higher filmquality as shown by higher refractive index values and lowerimpurity levels. Consequently, for low s values, SiNx filmswith low wet-etch rates of 0.5 nm/min in buffered HF solu-tion were obtained. Besides obtaining low s values by onlyincreasing the effective pumping speed, which would lead tolow pressures, s can also be relatively low even at moderatepressures when using high gas flows. These conditions couldbe favorable for sensitive devices where low pressure plas-mas can lead to plasma damage due to ion bombardment orenergetic plasma radiation. Since ligands are removed duringthe plasma step for basically all plasma-assisted ALD proc-esses, the dissociation of these reaction products in theplasma and the subsequent redeposition could play a role ina wide range of ALD processes.The authors would like to thank Maarten van Drunen andDr. Anne-Marije Andringa for refractive index measurementsand deposition of samples.
