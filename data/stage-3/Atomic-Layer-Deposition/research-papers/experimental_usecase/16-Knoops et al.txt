In short, a deposition cham-ber was connected to an inductively coupled plasma source and apump unit through gate valves. The pump unit consisted of a turbomolecular pump and a rotary pump reaching a base pressure of10?5 mbar by overnight pumping. MeCpPtMe3 precursor 98%,Sigma-Aldrich, heated to 70°C, was vapor drawn into the chamber.The substrates were heated to 100300°C precursor decompositionstarts above 310°C,3 while the reactor walls were kept at a tem-perature of 75°C.For the processes investigated the first half-cycle consisted ofMeCpPtMe3 precursor dosing with the bottom valve closed nopumping to maximize precursor usage. After the precursor expo-sure the reaction products were pumped out by opening the bottomvalve to the turbo pump.

Redistribution subject to Econsisted of a 5 s O2 exposure at 0.03 mbar. For the remote plasmaprocess the O2 gas flowed through the plasma source 0.01 mbarpressure while a 100 W plasma power was applied. A 0.5 s O2plasma exposure was used for Pt deposition, while a 5 s plasmaexposure resulted in the deposition of PtO2 films. Si100 with na-tive oxide or with 400 nm thermally grown SiO2 was used as thesubstrate.In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry SE with a J. A. Woollam, Inc.M2000U 0.755.0 eV ellipsometer was employed to determine thethickness and the dielectric function of the films during the ALDprocess. After deposition the optical range was extended to 6.5 eVusing ex situ variable-angle measurements with a J. A. Woollam,Inc. M2000D.15 Electrical resistivity was measured by a four-pointprobe FPP, whereas the atomic composition and mass density ofthe films were determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrom-etry RBS using 2 MeV 4He+ ions. The microstructure of the filmswas studied using X-ray diffraction XRD with a Philips XPertMPD diffractometer equipped with a Cu K source 1.54 Å radia-tion. Additionally, the thickness and mass density were determinedby X-ray reflectometry XRR measurements on a Bruker D8 Ad-vance X-ray diffractometer. The surface roughness of the films wasdetermined by atomic force microscopy AFM using an NT-MDTSolver P47 SPM.Results and DiscussionALD growth and nucleation delay. Pt films were deposited byremote plasma and thermal ALD, and PtO2 was deposited by remoteplasma ALD at a substrate temperature of 300°C. A summary of theconditions and material properties is given in Table I. For the ther-mal process a MeCpPtMe3 dosing time of 1 s is necessary to reachsaturation of the growth per cycle, while the remote plasma processrequires 3 s. The length of the plasma exposure time determineswhether Pt or PtO2 is deposited. A short O2 plasma exposure of 0.5s results in Pt, while a long O2 plasma exposure of 5 s results inPtO2. When using O2 gas, Pt is obtained up to long O2 exposuretimes in line with the results reported by Aaltonen et al.1When measuring the thickness as a function of the number ofcycles by in situ SE for the three processes Fig. 1, no growth wasobserved for thermal ALD on c-Si substrates with 400 nm SiO2 ornative oxide for the conditions employed. Pt growth on these sub-strates could only be achieved by using a higher O2 pressure0.8 mbar as also typically used in the literature.1,3 On the con-trary, remote plasma ALD of Pt 0.5 s O2 plasma leads to immedi-ate growth without a substantial nucleation delay. From the ellip-sometry measurements, which have a reduced accuracy in the first12 nm, it is concluded that growth per cycle is constant after thefirst 50 cycles. On the Pt film deposited by remote plasma ALD, thethermal ALD process continues without nucleation delay, demon-strating the possibility to deposit a Pt seed layer by remote plasmaCS license or copyright; see http://www.ecsdl.org/terms_use.jspG35Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 12 7 G34-G36 2009ALD. The remote plasma process of Pt shows a similar growth rateas the thermal process, which in turn is close to that reported byAaltonen et al. 0.045 nm/cycle.1The PtO2 process 5 s O2 plasma also shows immediate growthwith potentially a brief nucleation delay. After 50 cycles thegrowth per cycle is constant at 0.047 nm/cycle compared to0.055 nm/cycle found by Hämäläinen et al. using Ptacac2 andO3.13 From the difference in Pt atomic density, it is concluded thatfor PtO2, fewer Pt atoms are deposited per cycle than for the Ptprocess 1.1  1014 Pt cm?2 cycle?1 for PtO2 compared to 3.0 1014 Pt cm?2 cycle?1 for Pt. This is different from the thermalRu and RuO2 ALD process where the growth rate increases with thepartial O2 pressure going from Ru to RuO2 material.16The dielectric functions determined by SE for Pt and for PtO2 areshown in Fig. 2. The two materials result in very distinct dielectricfunctions, whereas the dielectric functions for Pt obtained by ther-mal ALD and remote plasma ALD are indistinguishable. The Pt wasmodeled using a DrudeLorentz parametrization, where the Drudeterm, dominant at low photon energies, accounts for the intrabandabsorption by conduction electrons. Several Lorentz oscillators at0.9, 1.5 eV, and higher energies were used for the interbandabsorption.17 In agreement with its semiconductive nature, the di-electric function of PtO2 could be parametrized by a single TaucLorentz oscillator 0.9 eV bandgap and 4.8 eV peak energy.18 Theoptical Tauc bandgap was 1.5 eV, which is close to the bandgapreported for sputtered amorphous PtO2 1.21.3 eV.8Table I.

Redistribution subject to EMaterial properties. As shown in Table I both the remoteplasma and thermal ALD process result in very similar materialproperties for the Pt films. In both cases high density21 g/cm3, low resistivity 15  cm, and high purity Ptfilms were deposited. The density and resistivity for these 30 nmthick films are close to the bulk values of 21.4 g/cm3 and10.8  cm, and they are similar to the values reported for thermalALD of Pt.1,3 The O and C contents remain below the RBS detec-tion limit 5% and grazing incidence XRD spectra Fig. 3 re-vealed a cubic phase composition for both the thermal and remoteplasma ALD Pt films. The relatively high intensity of the 220 peakindicates that the Pt crystallites have a preferred orientation withtheir 111 lattice planes parallel to the sample surface as also re-ported for the thermal ALD process.1,2 The remote plasma ALD Ptfilm, which is only slightly thicker than the thermal ALD film,shows much stronger diffraction peaks, indicating a higher crystal-linity. Both processes resulted in smooth films and had generallylower root-mean-square roughness values 0.40.7 nm than re-ported 0.754 nm.1-3 Because island growth is known to promotesurface roughening,19 the fast nucleation and, consequently, morepronounced layer-by-layer growth can be related to the lower sur-face roughness obtained for the remote plasma ALD process.The platinum oxide has a lower density and is slightly overstoi-chiometric PtO2.2. The resistivity is very high as it is above thedetection limit of the FPP 100  cm. For the process employ-ing Ptacac2 and O3, a lower resistivity 1.55  cm was re-ported most probably due to a lower O content PtO1.6.13,20 They thermal and remote plasma ALD from MeCpPtMe3 and O2 gas ord for analysis.

The thermalALD Pt process has a temperature window starting at 200°C. Thefact that the growth per cycle is reduced at lower substrate tempera-tures is not yet understood.21 From surface science studies, it can beinferred that the dissociative chemisorption of O2 on Pt111should not be the limiting factor.12 On the other hand, the remoteplasma ALD process which uses atomic oxygen from the gas phasehas a higher growth rate than the thermal process at 200°C. Thehigher resistivity 500  cm found for this temperature, how-ever, suggests incomplete removal of O and C impurities from thematerial. The poorer material properties could be overcome by anH2 plasma treatment. Exposure of the film to 300 s H2 plasma at100°C reduced the resistivity to 61  cm. Moreover, tests withFigure 3.

Color online The growth per cycle for remote plasma and ther-mal ALD of Pt and remote plasma ALD of PtO2 as a function of the substratetemperature. At 100°C the growth rate of the remote plasma process includ-ing a H2 gas exposure step in the ALD cycle is shown. For thermal ALD ofPt, deposition took place on 10 nm thick Pt starting surfaces prepared byremote plasma ALD at 300°C. The lines serve as guides to the eye.Downloaded 25 Mar 2010 to 131.155.151.26. Redistribution subject to Ean ALD cycle containing a H2 gas exposure step no plasma powerapplied of 2 s after the O2 plasma step resulted in excellent mate-rials properties for Pt at 100°C mass density of 19.8 g cm?3, no Cand O impurities detected, and a resistivity of 19  cm at 22 nmfilm thickness. These results demonstrate that the temperature win-dow for remote plasma ALD of Pt can effectively be extended downto 100°C. For PtO2 the growth per cycle decreases slightly withincreasing substrate temperature between 100 and 300°C, demon-strating that this process also has a large temperature window. At thesubstrate temperature of 300°C, decomposition of PtO2 is reportedto start for sputtered films, while in air decomposition starts at550°C due to the higher partial pressure of oxygen.20 For the pro-cess employing Ptacac2 and O3, only a small temperature windowwas observed 120130°C.13 Therefore, the large temperature win-dow of our PtO2 process suggests a higher stability of the material,which can most likely be related to the higher oxygen contentPtO2.2 compared to PtO1.6.ConclusionsRemote plasma ALD processes of Pt and PtO2 were developedfrom the combination of MeCpPtMe3 precursor and O2 plasma, andcompared to the thermal ALD process of Pt using the same precur-sor and O2 gas. High purity Pt can be obtained by a short O2 plasmaexposure, whereas PtO2 can be obtained by a long O2 plasma expo-sure. In situ SE revealed that the remote plasma processes lead toimmediate growth without substantial nucleation delay, whereas thethermal ALD process leads to no growth at all unless a Pt startingsurface or a high O2 pressure is employed. A broad temperaturewindow of 100300°C was achieved for both materials when de-posited by remote plasma ALD. For Pt a H2 gas exposure step wasincluded in the ALD cycle to obtain high purity films at 100°C.AcknowledgmentsThis work was sponsored by the Materials Innovation InstituteM2i under project no.
