Box 1000, FI-02044 Espoo, Finland*S Supporting InformationABSTRACT: LiMn2O4 is a promising candidate for a cathode material inlithium-ion batteries because of its ability to intercalate lithium ions reversiblythrough its three-dimensional manganese oxide network. One of the promisingtechniques for depositing LiMn2O4 thin-film cathodes is atomic layer deposition(ALD). Because of its unparalleled film thickness control and film conformality,ALD helps to fulfill the industry demands for smaller devices, nanostructuredelectrodes, and all-solid-state batteries. In this work, the intercalation mechanismof Li+ ions into an ALD-grown ?-MnO2 thin film was studied. Samples wereprepared by pulsing LiOtBu and H2O for different cycle numbers onto about 100nm thick MnO2 films at 225 °C and characterized with X-ray absorptionspectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, time-of-flight elastic recoildetection analysis, and residual stress measurements. It is proposed that for <100cycles of LiOtBu/H2O, the Li+ ions penetrate only to the surface region of the ?-MnO2 film, and the samples form a mixture of?-MnO2 and a lithium-deficient nonstoichiometric spinel phase LixMn2O4 (0 < x < 0.5). When the lithium concentrationexceeds x ? 0.5 in LixMn2O4 (corresponding to 100 cycles of LiOtBu/H2O), the crystalline phase of manganese oxide changesfrom the tetragonal pyrolusite to the cubic spinel, which enables the Li+ ions to migrate throughout the whole film. Annealing inN2 at 600 °C after the lithium incorporation seemed to convert the films completely to the pure cubic spinel LiMn2O4.? INTRODUCTIONLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are used for power storage inportable electronic devices, electric cars, and many othercutting-edge applications. LIBs are rechargeable batteries,which mean that Li+ ions migrate between the anode andcathode reversibly. For the battery to work and maintain itscapacity, the electrodes need to be stable when Li+ ions areintercalated to and extracted from the structure upon charge?discharge cycling. With the advent of technologies such aswearable electronics, there is an urgent need for thedevelopment of new concepts for the LIBs to meet theincreasing demands on energy density, mechanical properties,and capacity retention of the batteries. These demands can bemet with nanostructured electrodes and all-solid-state batteryarchitectures.1?4All-solid-state batteries require the electrode and electrolytematerials to be deposited as thin films. Atomic layer deposition(ALD) is a gas-phase thin-film deposition technique where thesubstrate is exposed to precursors alternately for self-limitingreaction steps.5 Reactions occur only between the precursorgas molecules and the surface species formed by the otherprecursor, so that the film thickness increases with anincreasing number of reaction cycles. As no chemical reactionstake place in the gas phase, the film growth is highlycontrollable, and the resulting films have excellent uniformityand conformality even on demanding, nanostructured surfacetopologies.6 These qualities make ALD an ideal technique todeposit electrode materials for LIBs.7The stoichiometric cubic spinel LiMn2O4 crystallizes in aspace group Fd3m (Figure 1). The oxygen anions arrange in acubic closed-packed structure, leaving two possible interstitialsites for the metal cations (denoted by Wyckoff symbols8):tetrahedral 8a, which are occupied by lithium ions, andoctahedral 16d, which are filled with manganese cations.LiMn2O4 is a superb cathode material because of its three-dimensional manganese oxide network which enables theintercalation of lithium ions also beyond the 1:1 Li/Mnstoichiometry, resulting in compositions in the range ofLixMn2O4, 0 ? x ? 2.9?11 The nonstoichiometric behaviorof the oxide improves the specific capacity of the material byReceived: April 1, 2019Revised: May 21, 2019Published: June 3, 2019Articlepubs.acs.org/JPCCCite This: J.

These propertiesmake the ALD LiMn2O4 thin film a very promising cathodematerial for LIBs and generate questions regarding themechanism of the intercalation.Miikkulainen et al.24 reported a full conversion of MnO2thin films to LiMn2O4 thin films by pulsing LiOtBu and H2Osequentially on the MnO2 film at 225 °C. Interestingly, Li+ions intercalated throughout the whole MnO2 film depth of100 nm. Normally, the LiOtBu?H2O process deposits Li2O orLiOH films,26?28 but on MnO2 it led into a direct intercalationof Li ions into the MnO2 films. Similar lithiation was attemptedalso on several other metal oxides (V2O5, TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO,Co3O4, Fe2O3, NiO, and MoO3), but was observed to occuronly on V2O5. As ALD thin-film battery materials are likely tobe vital contributors toward future portable devices, under-standing the Li intercalation process into MnO2 is a criticalstep toward the application of the thin-film LiMn2O4 cathodematerial. In this work, we aim to understand the intercalationof Li+ ions further by studying the phase and a local crystalstructure together with the electronic structure of a series ofthin-film samples using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS),X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), and time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) techni-ques.? EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONAll MnO2 and LixMn2O4 samples were deposited in aPICOSUN SUNALE R-150 ALD reactor. The depositionprocesses have been published earlier by Miikkulainen et al.24and Nilsen et al.29 The depositions took place in two steps:first, MnO2 was deposited using Mn(thd)3 (thd = 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato) (Volatec Oy) and ozone(AGA, 99.999%). Lithium was added into the MnO2 filmsby pulsing LiOtBu (lithium tert-butoxide) (Acros Organics,99%) and water alternately. The amount of lithium wascontrolled by the number of LiOtBu?H2O cycles. Thedeposition temperature in both the processes was 225 °C asin the study published earlier.24 N2 gas (AGA, 99.999%) wasused for purging and as a carrier gas.The MnO2 films were deposited on Si(100) wafers with apulsing sequence of 0.5 s pulse and 3.0 s purge for Mn(thd)3and 5.0 s pulse and 5.0 s purge for O3. The pulsing sequencewas repeated for 5000 times resulting in around an 86?100 nmthick MnO2 film. The source temperature for the Mn(thd)3powder precursor was 160 °C. O3 was made by feeding O2(AGA, 99.999%) into a Modular 4 HC ozone generator fromWedeco giving an ozone concentration of about 165 g/m3. Aneedle valve was used to control the O3 flow into the reactor. Aspecific nozzle was used in the O3 inlet to ensure gasdistribution over the whole wafer.Lithium was inserted into the film by a pulsing sequence of0.5 s pulse and 5 s purge for LiOtBu and 0.1 s pulse and 10 spurge for H2O. The source temperature of LiOtBu was 160 °C.The LiOtBu?H2O sequence was repeated for 10, 50, 100, 200,or 300 times, creating a set of samples with increasing lithiumconcentration. The samples with the highest lithiumconcentration, that is, the samples with 200 and 300LiOtBu?H2O cycles, were also annealed at 400 and/or 600°C under N2 gas (AGA, 99.999%). For clarity, the samples arenamed based on their preparation processes (Table 1).The film thicknesses were analyzed with XRR using aPANalytical Xpert Pro MPD diffractometer or a RigakuSmartLab diffractometer. Both the diffractometers use Cu K?radiation with a wavelength ? = 1.5419 Å. The compositions ofthe films were characterized with TOF-ERDA. The measure-ments were done with 79Br7+ ions obtained from a 5 MVtandem accelerator (model EGP-10-II) at the University ofHelsinki.The crystalline phases of the samples were analyzed withXRD. The measurements were done in two geometries. Out-of-plane ??2? diffraction was measured with the PANalyticalFigure 1.

In-plane 2??diffraction was measured using the Rigaku diffractometer and aRigaku Dtex250 detector with a parallel multilayer mirror andparallel slit collimator optical system. The constant ? and 2?angles were 0.3°.The residual stresses of the films were assessed using a TohoTechnology FLX-2320-S instrument by measuring thecurvature of the sample before and after the film depositionand lithium intercalation. The results were analyzed with aToho Technology Thin Film Stress Measurement Systemsoftware.The electronic structure and the local crystal structure of thesamples were studied with the X-ray absorption near-edgestructure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption finestructure (EXAFS) techniques. The measurements wereperformed for the K- and L-edges of manganese and for theK-edge of oxygen. The K-edge of manganese was studied at theCLÆSS beamline 22 of ALBA synchrotron.30 Duringoperation, electrons were at 3 GeV in the booster with acurrent of around 150 mA. The measurements were done atroom temperature (27.7 °C) under 10?2 bar pressure. Theprimary beam size was 1.5 × 0.5 mm2, and it was set to 45°angle with respect to the samples. The samples were measuredcontinuously in total fluorescence yield (TFY) and in totalelectron yield (TEY) modes. The TFY signal was collectedwith an XR-100SDD detector located at 90° with respect tothe incoming beam and the TEY signal by measuring the draincurrent of the samples. The data were collected up to k = 18Å?1 with the scanning sequence: 6400?6520 eV with steps of1 eV (total of 120 points in 60 s), 6521?6582 eV with steps of0.2 eV (total of 306 points in 153 s), and 6582.2?7782.8 withsteps of 1 eV (total of 1200 points in 600 s). The XANES dataanalysis was done using the ATHENA program within theIFEFFIT software package together with the curve and peakfitting software Fityk. The EXAFS data were least-square fittedto a theoretical model using ARTEMIS, also within theIFEFFIT package. A k range of 2.912?11.671 Å?1 was used inthe Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS data. Three powderstandards of MnO, MnO2, and LiMn2O4 were used.The L-edge of manganese and the K-edge of oxygen werestudied with XANES at the plane grating monochromator31beamline at the laboratory of Physikalisch-TechnischeBundesanstalt (PTB) at the synchrotron radiation sourceBESSY II. The measurement was performed using PTBsultrahigh vacuum instrument for X-ray spectrometry andFigure 2. Elemental depth profiles of the samples with increasing number of LiOtBu?H2O cycles.Table 2.

The incident beam angles were 0.5°, 1°, and 45°.? RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe samples were prepared by ALD in two steps. First anMnO2 film was deposited with Mn(thd)3 and O3 as precursors,and second, after characterization of the MnO2 film, lithiumwas intercalated by pulsing LiOtBu and H2O alternately so thatthe composition of the sample changed from MnO2 toLiMn2O4. A set of partially lithiated samples with averagestoichiometries through the whole film thickness in the rangeof LixMn2O4 0 < x < 1 was prepared by increasing the numberof LiOtBu/H2O ALD cycles from 10 to 300.Composition, Thickness, and Residual Stress. Compo-sitional analysis was done with TOF-ERDA. Figure 2 showsthe elemental depth profiles, and Table 2 reports the averagecompositions obtained by integrating over the whole filmthickness. The MnO2 film had an Mn/O stoichiometry of33:66, and the film contained only small amounts of impurities.Fluorine was found from all the samples and it most probablycomes from fluoroelastomer gaskets that were in use in thereactor and in the O3 line. The amount of lithium in the filmsincreased as the number of LiOtBu?H2O cycles increased, asexpected. Stoichiometric LiMn2O4 was achieved after 300 ALDcycles of LiOtBu and H2O on a 100 nm thick MnO2 film. Thedepth profiles (Figure 2) reveal that lithium is distributed onlyin the top part of the film in the samples 10cLi?MnO2, 50cLi?MnO2, and 100cLi?MnO2, that is, when the averagecomposition of the material is LixMn2O4, x ? 0.5. In thelithiated top parts of the films in these samples, the lithiumconcentrations were 0.6, 3.2, and 9.6 at. %, respectively. In thesamples 200cLi?MnO2 and 300cLi?MnO2, lithium ispenetrated throughout the whole film thickness. Judged byvisual inspection, the lithiation appeared to occur homoge-neously over the whole substrate. The easy and highlycontrollable gas-phase lithiation process provides films withexcellent purity, as the samples contained only small amountsof impurities.The film thickness was measured by XRR before and afterthe lithium intercalation (Table 3). For the MnO2 film, athickness nonuniformity of around 10% on a 150 mm Si waferwas achieved at best. The thinnest part of the film was at theopposite side of the wafer with respect to the O3 inlet. Thesuggested reason for the nonuniformity is that MnO2 catalyzesthe decomposition reaction of O3 and thus causes anonuniform O3 distribution across the substrate.33 XRRmeasurements were best fitted by modeling the film structureas a double layer of MnO2 and LiMn2O4 (an example of theXRR fit is shown in Supporting Information Figure S1). Thefilm thickness increased by 4?15% during lithium insertion.The surface roughness of the films varied randomly between3.3 and 5.5 nm (see Supporting Information Table S1). Thedepth of the lithium-containing layer increases through thesample series, and in most of the samples the lithiated layerthicknesses are essentially the same as those estimated fromthe TOF-ERDA depth profiles.Residual stress was analyzed after the MnO2 film depositionas well as after 300 cycles of lithium insertion. The films for theresidual stress measurements were deposited on one side of the50 mm double-side-polished Si wafers. The residual stress ofthe MnO2 film was 560 MPa in the tensile direction. The stresschanged compressive and increased to ?2300 MPa after the300 cycles of lithium insertion. As seen in the thicknessanalysis of 300cLi?MnO2, the film expands during the lithiuminsertion, which is thought to be the origin for the highcompressive stress.Phase Identification, Electronic Structure, and LocalStructure. The phase change from the pyrolusite ?-MnO2 tothe spinel LiMn2O4 is clearly visible in the XRD and XASmeasurements. The samples are divided into three groups withincreasing progress in the phase change: when the averagecomposition of the sample is x < 0.5 in LixMn2O4, when x ?0.5 in LixMn2O4, and after the samples are annealed. Thefollowing paragraphs explain the details of each of the stepsaccording to the XRD and XAS results.Phase Change When the Average Composition isbelow x = 0.5 in LixMn2O4. The in-plane 2?? and out-of-plane ??2??XRD measurements of the samples MnO2?50cLi?MnO2 are shown in Figure 3a,b. The samples aremixtures of two phases: the pyrolusite ?-MnO2 (ICDD PDF24-0735), with a space group of P42/mnm, and the spinelLi1?xMn2O4 (ICDD PDF 38-0789), with a space group ofFd3m. In these samples, the reflections from Li1?xMn2O4 aresignificantly lower in intensity compared to the reflectionsfrom ?-MnO2. The sharp reflection at 33.0° in the out-of-plane??2? measurements is from the Si substrate. In the ??2?diffractogram of the MnO2 sample, there is a reflection at41.3°, which is identified as the (200) reflection of thetetragonal pyrolusite MnO2. In addition, the sample has areflection at 20.3°, which is indexed as (100). The (100)reflection is forbidden for symmetry reasons in the tetragonalpyrolusite space group P42/mnm, but it may appear if theresidual stress in the film deforms the structure to be slightlyorthorhombic instead of tetragonal. This was suggested earlierby Nilsen et al.29,34 See Supporting Information Figure S2 formore details of the phase identification of the MnO2 sample.In the beginning of the lithium intercalation, threereflections of Li1?xMn2O4 are somehow visible, the reflectionat an angle 44.4° being the strongest one. The reflection isindexed as (400), and it decreases in intensity as the lithiumintercalation proceeds. The other two reflections at 17.7° and35.9° are lower in intensity in these samples. At around 32.6°in the out-of-plane ??2? measurements of 10cLi?MnO2, thereis an additional impurity reflection (marked with an asteriskTable 3.

As shown later, the same reflection is visible inthe 100cLi?MnO2 sample, and the 200cLi?MnO2 sample hasa clear additional reflection at 47.4° in the in-plane 2??diffractogram. These reflections are most likely caused by alithium-rich Li2?zMnO2 (ICDD PDF 38-1282) impurity phase,which has (100) reflection at 32.5° and (012) reflection at47.6°.Mn K-edge XANES was measured from every sample in theTEY and TFY (Supporting Information Figure S4) modes.The Mn K-edge EXAFS was measured in the TFY mode. TEYgives information only on the surface of the film, whereas TFYprobes the whole film. Although the partially lithiated sampleshave evident compositional variation in their depth profiles(Figure 2), the TEY and TFY graphs looked surprisinglysimilar to each other.The Mn?O, Mn?Mn1, and Mn?Mn2 bonds are readilydetected in the Mn K-edge EXAFS of ?-MnO2 and LiMn2O4.The Mn?O distance means the bond length between Mn andO. The Mn?Mn1 distance is the shortest one between twomanganese atoms in the centers of edge-sharing octahedrons,and Mn?Mn2 is the distance between the Mn atoms in thecenters of the corner-sharing octahedrons in the ?-MnO2structure. The longer Mn?Mn2 distance does not exist inthe LiMn2O4 structure.The manganese K-edge XANES and EXAFS measurementssupport the XRD results, showing that the samples ?-MnO2?50cLi?MnO2 have features comparable to the ?-MnO2reference (Figure 4a,b). Immediate reduction of manganeseoccurs as soon as lithium is inserted, as the absorption edgeshifts to lower energy in the Mn K-edge XANES (Figure 4a).The fine structures of the pre-edge regions of the samplesresemble the MnO2 powder reference (close-up in Figure 4a).The FT EXAFS spectra show that the samples have all thethree peaks of Mn?O, Mn?Mn1, and Mn?Mn2 visible in thesame way as the MnO2 reference (Figure 4b).The L-edge XANES of Mn was studied in addition to the K-edge because the L-edge studies give direct information on thebonding in the samples. The L-edge XANES measures theabsorption by the electric dipole-allowed transition from the2p orbital to the unfilled 3d orbital of a transition metalresulting in an intense and feature-rich LII,III-edge XANESspectra. In comparison, the K-edge XAS measures the electricFigure 3. XRD diffractograms of the samples MnO2?50cLi?MnO2: (a) 2?? and (b) ??2? measurements.

The L-edge of Mn wasmeasured at incident angles of 0.5°, 1°, and 45°. Thepenetration depth of X-rays is dependent on both the photonenergy and the incident angle of the X-ray beam. Themeasurement performed at the 45° incident angle probes thewhole film depth, whereas the measurements done with the0.5° and 1° incident angles are mostly surface-sensitive.In the Mn L-edge XANES spectrum, the first region comesas a result of Mn3+ and the second one as a result of Mn4+.35,36When the bulk films are compared (Figure 4c), the reductionof Mn is again notable already from the 10cLi?MnO2 sampleonward as the absorption increases at around 641 eV. Similarcomparisons of the measurements done with the 1° and 0.5°incident angles are shown in Supporting Information FigureS5a,b.Phase Change When the Average CompositionExceeds x = 0.5 on LixMn2O4. Figure 5a,b show the in-plane 2?? and out-of-plane ??2? measurements of the samples100cLi?MnO2?300cLi?MnO2. As seen from the TOF-ERDAresults, in the samples 200cLi?MnO2 and 300cLi?MnO2,lithium has penetrated throughout the whole film thickness.These samples do not anymore have the ?-MnO2 phase in theXRD patterns. The reflections from ?-MnO2 disappear evenbefore the structure has reached the stoichiometric LiMn2O4composition.The two reflections from the lithiated phase shift to lower 2?values from 17.7° to 17.1° and from 35.9° to 34.7° as theconcentration of lithium is increased. In all the samples, the d-spacing of the latter reflection is half of the first reflection,indicating that the reflection on the higher angle is a multipleof the first one. Yet another multiple of the peaks was detectedat 75.0° with a d-spacing value of one-quarter of the first peak(see Supporting Information Figure S3). However, these peakscannot be indexed to the cubic Li1?xMn2O4 phase. It could bethat the samples have a mixture of the cubic and some otherlithiated phase, but because no additional phase wasrecognized in the in-plane diffractograms, even more probableis that the cubic crystal structure is distorted by stress anddeformed in one dimension. In addition to stress, the filmsclearly contain microstrain which is evident from the muchFigure 5. XRD (a) 2?? and (b) ??2? measurements of the samples 100cLi?MnO2?300cLi?MnO2.

Still more studies are requiredto reach a complete and thorough phase identification of thesesamples.The fine structures of the pre-edge of the Mn K-edgeXANES of the samples 100cLi?MnO2 and 200cLi?MnO2resemble that of the LiMn2O4 reference (Figure 6a). Inaddition, the reduction of Mn is again noted as the absorptionedge continues its shift to lower energy as the concentration oflithium is increased. The Mn K-edge EXAFS results of all thesamples in Figure 6b show only the peaks Mn?O and Mn?Mn1. The absence of the Mn?Mn2 peak supports the XANESresults, as it indicates that LiMn2O4 is the dominant phase inthese samples. The 300cLi?MnO2 sample has an overalldifferent shape in the pre-edge region in the XANES spectracompared to the references and to the earlier published resultson the shape of the K-edge for octahedrally coordinatedtransition metals;37,38 therefore, the environment aroundmanganese is probably not octahedral in the 300cLi?MnO2sample.All the thin-film samples had their absorption edges at lowerenergies than that of the reference MnO2 powder, and most ofthe lithiated samples had their absorption edges at lowerenergies than that of the reference LiMn2O4 powder (Figure6a). The peaks in the pre-edge region have also higherintensities compared to the references. The higher intensitymost likely comes as a result of the JT-active Mn3+ ions; so,both features indicate that the average oxidation state ofmanganese in the samples is lower than +3.5.39The determination of the average oxidation state ofmanganese will be discussed later in detail, but the presenceof the Mn3+ ions is noticeable in the EXAFS graphs as wellbecause diminishing of the peaks Mn?O and Mn?Mn1 occursas a result of the increasing local distortion around themanganese atoms (Figure 6b). Also, the Mn?O bond lengthseems to increase slightly as the concentration of Li increasesin the samples.39 The lengthening of the bond can occurbecause of the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+, as the ionic radiusof the manganese cation increases and the JT-active Mn3+ candistort the structure and thereby lengthen the Mn?O bondeven further.The electrons on the 2p orbitals of oxygen participating inthe bonding in the Mn?O octahedra and therefore the oxygenK-edge XANES, which probe the electric dipole-allowed 1s ?2p transition of oxygen, make an interesting addition to theMn L-edge XAS measurements. The oxygen K-edge wasmeasured for the MnO2, 200cLi?MnO2, 300cLi?MnO2,200cLi?MnO2-600, and 300cLi?MnO2-600 samples at 0.5°,1°, and 45° incident angles.Both the Mn L-edge and the O K-edge XANES of the100cLi?MnO2?300cLi?MnO2 samples have features thatshow the presence of Mn3+ in the film bulk (Figure 7a,b). InFigure 7. Comparison of (a) Mn L-edge and (b) O K-edge XANES measured at an incident angle of 45°.

A higher incident angle probes deeper into the film as schematically shownon the right. The graphs have been rescaled.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b03039J. Phys. Chem. C 2019, 123, 15802?1581415808the literature of the Mn L-edge XANES on LiMn2O4, mostlyMn4+ was found,40 but the samples as well as the MnO2,Mn2O3, and LiMn2O4 reference powders measured hereshowed different fine structures compared to the literatureresults.40?43 The literature data were however measured in theTEY mode and are thus surface-sensitive, whereas our datawere measured in the TFY mode and are thus bulk-sensitive.The results of the Mn L-edge and O K-edge XANES measuredat 0.5° and 1° incident angles are presented in SupportingInformation Figures S5 and S6.All the samples, even MnO2, show Mn3+ features on thesurface of the film in both the Mn L-edge and in the O K-edgeXANES (MnO2 sample in Figure 7c,d and 300cLi?MnO2 inFigure 7e,f). These features can be exhibited because of thesurface contamination or oxygen vacancies that result in areduced octahedral symmetry of oxygen atoms at the surface.44The 300cLi?MnO2 sample also has an additional resonance ataround 532 eV in the O K-edge XANES (Figure 7f). On thebasis of the peak shape, the manganese and oxygen atoms donot form an octahedron. The sample may have carboncontamination because according to the literature the K-edgeof oxygen bonded to carbon has features similar to that of thesurface of the 300cLi?MnO2 sample.45 However, becauseTOF-ERDA shows a low carbon content, the odd finestructure could be a result of oxygen vacancies on the verysurface of the film.The amount of Mn4+ and Mn3+ in the film bulk was roughlyestimated by calculating the different linear combinations ofthe Mn4+ and Mn3+ references and comparing them to themeasured Mn LIII-edge XANES (Figure 8). The MnO2 sampleresembles the Mn4+ reference, as expected, and so do the10cLi?MnO2 and 50cLi?MnO2 samples. The 100cLi?MnO2and 200cLi?MnO2 samples match the reference calculatedwith the Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio of 80%/20%. The 300cLi?MnO2sample resembles mostly the reference where the ratio ofMn4+/Mn3+ is 60%/40%, which is in line with the expectationfor this sample with the almost stoichiometric composition ofLi1.1Mn2O4.Effect of Annealing. After 300 ALD cycles of LiOtBu?H2O, the films have a remarkably high compressive stress of2300 MPa, which is thought to cause a peak shift in the ??2?measurements. After annealing at 600 °C for 10 min, thediffraction patterns of 200cLi?MnO2-600 and 300cLi?MnO2-600 match better with the stoichiome
