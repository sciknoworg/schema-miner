X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the suppression ofAs oxide formation in air exposed InGaAs surfaces for all H2S exposure temperatures. Transmissionelectron microscopy analysis demonstrates a reduction of the interface oxide between theIn0.53Ga0.47As epitaxial layer and the amorphous HfO2 resulting from the in situ H2S passivation.The capacitance-voltage and current-voltage behavior of Pd /HfO2 / In0.53Ga0.47As / InP structuresdemonstrates that the electrical characteristics of samples exposed to 50 °C H2S at the end of themetal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy In0.53Ga0.47As growth are comparable to those obtained using anex situ aqueous NH42S passivation. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.DOI: 10.1063/1.2829586In order to continue complementary metal oxide semi-conductor CMOS development beyond the 22 nm node,alternative channel materials in combination with high di-electric constant k gate layers are currently under investi-gation. One of these approaches is to use high-mobility III-Vmaterials such as InGaAs and GaAs as channel layers.16High mobility substrates offer the potential for increasedtransconductance at reduced voltages, increasing perfor-mance at supply voltages 1 V. However, a significant fac-tor which has inhibited the use of such materials is the lackof stable, high quality gate insulators on III-V channels. Agate oxide is required with high dielectric constant and suf-ficiently low density of interface states to avoid Fermi levelpinning at the interface with the III-V substrate. As atomiclayer deposition ALD of high-k dielectrics on Si is becom-ing a reality in manufactured devices, recent research is in-vestigating this approach for use in III-V based devices.7,8 Anumber of groups have also investigated surface passivationof the InxGa1?xAs substrate prior to oxide deposition.911 Insitu gaseous passivation is preferable to ex situ aqueous tech-niques which are more likely to introduce contaminants suchas C, Na, and heavy metals, as well as increasing InGaAssurface roughness. In addition, both ALD and MOVPE aremore attractive techniques than MBE for use in manufactur-ing technology. In this letter, we evaluate an in situ passiva-tion performed at the end of the MOVPE growth of highindium content lattice matched In0.53Ga0.47As grown on InPsubstrates. The technique is based on the exposure of theIn0.53Ga0.47As surface to H2S at the end of the growth pro-cess, prior to gate dielectric formation. The approach is par-ticularly suited to MOVPE III-V growth as H2S is used as an-type dopant source for InGaAs. The gate oxide employedin this work is ALD grown HfO2 using the metal organicprecursor HfNCH324.12In0.53Ga0.47As lattice-matched epitaxial layers of thick-ness 2 m and S doped to 41017 /cm3, were grown in aMOVPE system immediately following growth of a 0.1 mInP buffer layer S doped, 21018 /cm3 on n-type InP100wafers S doped, 131018 /cm3. In situ passivation ofthe InGaAs surface was performed in the MOVPE chamberimmediately after growth by flowing H2S over the samples ata flow-rate of 0.1 SCCM SCCM denotes cubic centimeterper minute at STP, at three different temperatures 50, 200,or 350 °C, for 90 min in a H2 carrier gas. Subsequently thewafers were moved to an ex situ ALD reactor involving90 s ambient exposure. HfO2 layers 3 15 nm weredeposited at a temperature of 250 °C by alternating pulses ofH2O and the HfO2 precursor HfNCH324, the initial pulsebeing that of the Hf precursor. MOS structures were com-pleted by vacuum evaporation of 100 nm of Pd using adeposition rate of 2.5 Å /s, and lift-off, to define capacitorsof various areas. No Ohmic back contacts to the InP wereformed. Ex situ aqueous sulfur S passivation was per-formed in ambient by dipping InGaAs / InP samples inNH42S diluted to 20% in de-ionized water at 60 °C for20 min. The Pd /HfO2 / In0.53Ga0.47As / InP structures exam-ined in this work experienced no annealing following eitherdielectric deposition or gate metal formation.Passivated InGaAs surfaces were studied using x-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy XPS, following 60 s ambientexposure before loading to the XPS system, to evaluate theeffectiveness of the in situ passivation approach in suppress-ing native oxide regrowth. XPS spectra of a sample passi-vated using ex situ aqueous NH42S are also included forcomparison. Figure 1a shows a comparison of the S 2speak for all samples. XPS does detect S on the InGaAs sur-face for both the 350 °C in situ passivated sample and the exaElectronic mail: paul.hurley@tyndall.ie.APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 022902 20080003-6951/2008/922/022902/3/$23.00 © 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 022902-1situ aqueous S passivated sample, but in the case of the 50and 200 °C in situ passivated samples no S is detected on thesurface. XPS spectra of the As 3d core level for the unpas-sivated and passivated samples are shown in Fig. 1b. ThisXPS peak is selected to examine the effect of the passivationon suppressing native oxide growth due to the large chemicalshift between the As 3d peak and that of the arsenic oxide. Inthe case of the unpassivated sample, a peak is observed at45 eV and assigned to As2O3. In the case of all the in situpassivated samples this peak is not evident, indicating thatthis approach is effective in preventing As2O3 formation onthe InGaAs surface. This is desirable as it has been reportedthat the unstable As2O3 can react to form elemental As whichresults in Fermi level pinning.10,13 The absence of S on thesurface of the 50 and 200 °C samples and the fact thatAs2O3 formation was inhibited on both, indicate that S maynot be the primary passivating element in this process.Figure 2a compares high frequency capacitance volt-age CV curves for the unpassivated device and the variousin situ passivation approaches for a nominal ALD HfO2thickness of 9 nm. The minimum capacitance Cmin, at Vg=?2 V, is approaching the expected theoretical value of0.0019 F /m2, calculated for these structures assuming inver-sion at the InGaAs /HfO2 interface.13 The device fabricatedon the 50 °C in situ passivated surface 50 °C device dis-plays the highest maximum capacitance in accumulationCmax and also exhibits the sharpest transition from deple-tion to accumulation. The inset of Fig. 2a shows the currentdensity-voltage JV characteristics for unpassivated and insitu passivated MOS structures. All structures exhibit lowleakage current density 510?7 A /cm2 at Vfb+1 V,demonstrating that these ALD HfO2 films on InGaAs arehighly insulating. It is lowest in the case of the 50 °C device,510?8 A /cm2 at Vfb+1 V. Figure 2b shows multifre-quency CV curves measured over the range of1 kHz1 MHz for the 50 °C device. The low frequency CVbehavior observed in the 1 kHz curve has been reported pre-viously in narrow bandgap materials.1416 The inset of Fig.2b shows the CV hysteresis curve for the 50 °C device,which has the lowest measured hysteresis, 380 mV aroundCfb. These levels of frequency dispersion and hysteresis areto be expected as no postdeposition thermal anneal was per-formed on these MOS structures.9 The fact that the 50 °Cpassivated device, which XPS showed to have no detectableS signal at the surface, displays the best electrical propertiesis further evidence that S is not the primary passivating ele-ment for the in situ process. It is possible to speculate thathydrogen may be passivating the InGaAs surface. One pos-sibility is low temperature dissociative adsorption of H2S toproduce HS and H species which may bond to As at theepitaxial layer surface. This has been observed in previousstudies of H2S treatment of GaAs001.17 In addition, thefact that H species formed on the surface by H2S dissociationwill be in equilibrium with the H2 MOVPE carrier gas mayassist in allowing H passivation to occur by reducing hydro-gen desorption from the surface. The possibility that hydro-gen passivation occurs in this process is subject to furtherinvestigation.Figure 3a shows a bright field transmission electronmicroscopy TEM micrograph for a 50 °C in situ H2S pas-sivated InGaAs device with a 9.4 nm HfO2 layer and a0.8 nm thick interfacial layer IL between the HfO2 andInGaAs. This is less than half the thickness of the IL of1.9 nm measured by TEM for the unpassivated device Fig.3b. This indicates that this in situ passivation technique iseffective in significantly inhibiting interfacial oxide growth.Considering that the maximum H2S flow rate was limited to0.1 SCCM in this MOVPE process, there is scope for refine-ment and potential improvement of this in situ passivationtechnique.CV curves for a thickness series of 3, 9.4, and 16.8 nmthick ALD HfO2 layers on 50 °C in situ passivated InGaAsare shown in Fig. 4a. The inset plots the JV response forthe three thicknesses. As expected, the leakage current den-sity at Vfb+1 V is significantly higher for the 3 nm device,210?6 A /cm2, compared to 310?8 A /cm2 and 210?8 A /cm2 for the 9.4 and 16.8 nm devices, respectively.FIG. 1.

Nocapacitance correction was made for inductive and resistive elements in thecircuit. The average frequency dispersion of the flatband capacitance Cfb, is3.5% per decade for all devices. The hysteresis measured around Cfb at100 kHz was 460 mV for the unpassivated device, and 380, 585, and410 mV for the 50, 200, and 350 °C in situ H2S passivated devices,respectively.022902-2 OConnor et al. Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 022902 2008For these HfO2 layers, we estimate a HfO2 k value of 23.Figure 4b compares the electrical characteristics of a9.4 nm thick ALD HfO2 layer 0.8 nm IL deposited on In-GaAs passivated in situ by H2S flow at 50 °C, and an 11 nmthick ALD HfO2 layer 1.3 nm IL on InGaAs passivatedex situ in aqueous NH42S. Although a slight Vfb shift isapparent, a similar profile is observed in the CV curves ofboth devices. Both devices have a similar Cmax in accumula-tion while the in situ passivated device appears to haveslightly higher interface state density. The JV plot in the insetof Fig. 4b shows similar leakage current density at Vfb+1 V with a higher electric breakdown field for the in situpassivated device. This demonstrates that the in situ passiva-tion approach employed in this work can achieve resultscomparable to those obtained using ex situ aqueous NH42Spassivation.In summary, we have studied an in situ passivation ofIn0.53Ga0.47As performed using the H2S dopant source50350 °C at the end of MOVPE growth prior to deposi-tion of ALD HfO2. XPS analysis revealed the suppression ofAs oxide growth on in situ passivated InGaAs layers. TheMOS device, which experienced a passivation temperatureof 50 °C, displays the best electrical characteristics, withTEM indicating a significant reduction in interfacial oxidethickness compared to the unpassivated and NH42S passi-vated devices. The potential for developing this passivationapproach for use in future CMOS applications is demon-strated by the fact that results comparable to those obtainedusing ex situ aqueous NH42S passivation can be achieved.The authors thank Dan OConnell, Tyndall National In-stitute, for sample processing.
