ABSTRACT: In this manuscript, we demonstrate a new process for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) thin /uniFB01 lms using trimethylgallium (TMGa) and ozone. We evaluated a variety of oxygen sources for Ga O 2 3 ALD using TMGa but found that only ozone was e /uniFB00 ective. We explored the mechanism for Ga2O3 ALD using in situ quartz crystal microbalance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and quadrupole mass spectrometry studies. We found that TMGa dissociatively adsorbs onto the Ga O3 2 surface to form Ga(CH3)2 surface species and liberate ∼ 20% of the methyl ligands as CH . Next, the 4 ozone reacts with these methyl species to form hydroxyl and formate surface groups and liberate CH2O. We prepared ALD Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms on Si(100) and fused SiO2 substrates and analyzed the /uniFB01 lms using a variety of techniques. We found the Ga2O3 growth to be selflimiting with a growth rate of ∼ 0.52 Å/cycle between 200 and 375 ° C. Moreover, the Ga2 O3 /uniFB01 lms were stoichiometric, free of residual carbon, and exhibited properties similar to bulk Ga2O3. Scanning electron microscopy revealed smooth /uniFB01 lms with good step coverage over

## ■ INTRODUCTION

Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) thin /uniFB01 lms have been utilized in a wide variety of applications, including phosphors, 1 -4 transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), 5,6 gas sensors, 7 -9 and passivating dielectrics for GaAs-based electronics. 10 -12 With such varied applications, a number of techniques have been developed for depositing Ga2O3 thin /uniFB01 lms, including evaporation, 13,14 sputtering, 13,15 pulsed laser deposition, 5,6 chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 16 -18 and atomic layer deposition (ALD). 19 -24 In particular, ALD provides a number of advantages for preparing Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms. ALD utilizes iterative, self-saturating precursor exposures to deposit thin /uniFB01 lms in a well-controlled, monolayer-by-monolayer fashion. As a result, ALD enables precise thickness control, high uniformity in both thickness and composition over large areas, and excellent step coverage. Furthermore, ALD is typically conducted at lower temperatures than CVD, thus enabling thermally sensitive substrates, such as polymers, to be coated.

One of the most important attributes for ALD precursors is high volatility. 25 This quality is particularly important for coating high aspect ratio or porous substrates and for scaling the ALD process to larger areas. Although Ga2O3 ALD processes have previously been demonstrated using Ga(acac) , 3 19,20 ((CH3)2GaNH2)3, 21 Ga2(N(CH3)2)6, 22,23 and a Ga alkoxide, 24 all of these precursors must be heated to achieve an adequate vapor pressure. In contrast, trimethylgallium (TMGa) has a very high vapor pressure of 227 Torr at room temperature. 26 Additionally, TMGa is chemically similar and analogous to trimethylaluminum (TMA), which is considered a model precursor for Al2 O3 ALD. 27 It is therefore somewhat

surprising that there have been no reports using TMGa for Ga2O3 ALD, although TMGa has been utilized for Ga2O3 CVD at high temperatures 28 and as a dopant in the ALD of Ga-doped ZnO thin /uniFB01 lms. 29

In this work, we demonstrate the suitability of TMGa for the ALD of high quality Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms. Although a number of di /uniFB00 erent oxygen sources were explored, only ozone (O3) permitted Ga2O3 ALD with TMGa. We used in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), 30,31 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 32 -36 and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) 30,37 studies to develop an understanding of the surface reactions at work during Ga2O3 ALD. With suitable ALD process conditions established by the in situ studies, we deposited Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms on Si(100) and fused SiO2 substrates. The properties of these /uniFB01 lms were then characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray di /uniFB00 raction (XRD), spectroscopic ellipsometry, optical spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

## ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

ALD was conducted in a custom, viscous /uniFB02 ow reactor with the reaction zone consisting of a heated, 5 cm diameter, stainless steel tube. 31 The pressure within the reactor was maintained at ∼ 1 Torr using a 300 sccm /uniFB02 ow of ultra high purity (UHP, 99.999%) nitrogen carrier gas. Ga2O3 ALD was conducted using TMGa (99+%, Strem Chemicals, Inc.) as the Ga source. TMGa was dosed through a 100 μ m diameter

ori /uniFB01 ce to achieve a TMGa partial pressure of ∼ 20 mTorr within the reactor. A variety of oxygen sources were screened, including H2O, H2O2 (30 wt % in H2O), isopropanol, O2, O3, and H2O/O2 mixtures. 38 The liquid precursor vapors (H2O, H2O2, and isopropanol) were all dosed at room temperature through a needle valve. Ozone was generated by /uniFB02 owing UHP oxygen (99.999%) through an ozone generator (Lab-113, Paci /uniFB01 c Ozone) at 400 sccm while keeping the pressure within the generator at 2 -3 psi. The ozone generator output was approximately 8 wt % O3 in O2. The O3 and O2 were introduced into the reactor through a 200 μ m diameter ori /uniFB01 ce at a backing pressure of 1 atm. The Ga2O3 ALD timing sequences are expressed as: t 1 - - -t 2 t 3 t 4 , where t 1 is the TMGa exposure time, t 3 is the oxygen source exposure time, and t 2 and t 4 are the respective purge times, with all times in seconds.

reactor walls were maintained at 200 ° C to prevent precursor condensation.

In situ QCM studies were conducted using a modi ed /uniFB01 Maxtek Model BSH-150 sensor head loaded into the ALD reactor tube with y12.5 ° cut GaPO4 sensor crystals (R-20, Piezocryst Advanced Sensorics Gmbh). The y-12.5 ° cut GaPO4 crystals are temperature compensated at 240 ° C and enable QCM measurements with enhanced stability at temperatures greater than 200 ° C. 39 The mass changes per unit area were calculated by measuring the frequency shifts and applying the Sauerbrey equation. 39

In situ QMS measurements were conducted with a di /uniFB00 erentially pumped QMS (Stanford Research Systems, Model RGA300) located downstream from the sample position and separated from the reactor by a 35 μ m ori /uniFB01 ce. In order to detect species with m e / ∼ 28, the carrier gas was changed to UHP Ar (99.999%) for these studies. Additionally, no samples were loaded into the reactor during these studies, so just the surface area of the reactor tube is responsible for the reaction products observed.

In situ FTIR studies of Ga O 2 3 ALD were conducted in transmission mode using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scienti /uniFB01 c) and a smaller reactor that is similar to those described previously. 32,40 The FTIR reactor utilized gate valves that were closed during the precursor exposures to prevent growth on the CsI windows. Substrates for FTIR measurements were prepared by pressing a nanopowder into a stainless steel grid. 41 The grids were fabricated using photochemical machining (Fotofab, Inc.) and were 50 μ m thick with 50 μ m bars and 200 μ m square openings. Depending upon the FTIR features of interest, either ZrO2 (&lt;100 nm diameter) or SiO2 (10 -20 nm diameter) nanopowders were utilized. ZrO2 is relatively transparent from 4000 to 800 cm -1 while SiO2 is relatively transparent from 4000 to 1400 cm -1 and 1000 -500 cm -1 . The nanopowder/uniFB01 lled grid was mounted into a stage that could be heated to 500 ° C. This stage was then loaded into the FTIR reactor such that the IR beam passed through the center of the grid. During in situ FTIR measurements, the substrate temperature was maintained by the heated stage, while the

ALD Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms were deposited onto Si(100) and fused SiO2 substrates and then characterized by a variety of techniques. The /uniFB01 lm thickness and optical properties were determined by /uniFB01 xed angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (alpha-SE, J. A. Woollam Co.) using a Cauchy model to /uniFB01 t the ellipsometric data. SEM images were acquired using a Hitachi S4700 with a /uniFB01 eld-emission electron source and secondary electron detectors. Cross-sectional SEM measurements of cleaved specimens were utilized to con /uniFB01 rm the ellipsometric thickness measurements. The morphology and step coverage of the Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms were assessed by imaging /uniFB01 lms deposited onto micromachined Si substrates with trenches of varied aspect ratios. The crystallinity of the as-deposited and annealed Ga O3 2 /uniFB01 lms was determined by XRD (D8 Advance, Bruker). Annealing to enhance the /uniFB01 lm crystallinity was conducted in a quartz tube furnace under a /uniFB02 owing UHP Ar atmosphere. The /uniFB01 lm composition and density were measured by RBS measurements conducted by Evans Analytical Group. The RBS measurements were conducted using a 2.275 MeV He 2+ ion beam with a backscattering angle of 160 ° and a grazing angle of 96 . ° Residual carbon within the Ga O3 2 /uniFB01 lm was assessed by XPS spectra acquired by Evans Analytical Group. The /uniFB01 lm surface was /uniFB01 rst sputtered with a 4 keV Ar + source to remove adventitious carbon and enable sampling of the ' bulk ' /uniFB01 lm composition. Optical spectroscopy measurements were performed in transmission mode using a UV -vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian, Inc.). For these measurements, the ALD Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms were deposited onto both sides of fused SiO 2 substrates, and the measurements were referenced to an uncoated fused SiO2 substrate.

## ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In situ QCM Measurements. In situ QCM measurements were conducted at reaction temperatures between 250 and 350 ° C to evaluate di /uniFB00 erent oxygen sources and processing conditions for Ga2O3 ALD. Prior to each experiment, the QCM crystal was /uniFB01 rst coated with ∼ 5 nm ALD Al2O3 using alternating exposures to TMA and H2O in order to achieve a reproducible starting surface for the Ga O 2 3 ALD nucleation and growth. In all cases, a mass gain was observed during the /uniFB01 rst TMGa exposure onto the fresh Al2O3 surface, presumably due to the facile chemisorption of the TMGa onto the Al -OH surface hydroxyls. However, sustained mass gains during repeated Ga2O3 ALD cycles were only observed with ozone as the oxygen source. Apparently, the H O, H O , isopropanol, 2 2 2 O2, and H2O/O2 mixtures are not su /uniFB03 ciently reactive with the TMGa-terminated surface, even at 350 ° C. Consequently,

(b) Enlarged image of symmetric CH3 deformation feature during /uniFB01 rst TMGa-H2O cycle and /uniFB01 rst O 3 exposure. Initial feature due to TMGa adsorption on Al O 2 3 surface consists of peaks at 1209 and 1220 cm -1 . H2O exposure removes only the peak at 1209 cm -1 , whereas O3 exposure removes the peak at 1220 cm -1 .

ozone is the only suitable oxygen source for Ga O 2 3 ALD using TMGa. However, an O2 plasma may work for the plasmaassisted ALD (PEALD) of Ga2O3 using TMGa.

Figure 1a shows the mass versus time recorded by QCM during 40 cycles of alternating TMGa-O3 exposures beginning on an Al2 O3 surface using the timing sequence 6 -10 - -6 10 at a deposition temperature of 350 ° C. The growth is highly linear at 31 ng/cm /cycle with no indication of inhibited growth on 2 the initial Al O 2 3 surface. Assuming the β -Ga2O3 bulk density of 5.88 g/cm , this mass gain corresponds to a growth rate of 0.53 3 Å/cycle. Figure 1b shows an expanded view of three consecutive Ga2O3 ALD cycles. There is an average mass gain of 34.4 ng/cm 2 with each TMGa exposure and a mass loss of 3.4 ng/cm 2 with each ozone exposure, yielding a net mass gain of 31 ng/cm 2 for each complete Ga2O3 ALD cycle. These mass changes provide insight into the adsorption of TMGa onto the Ga2O3 surface. On the basis of the ligand-exchange mechanism typically observed for metal alkyls on hydroxylated surfaces, 42,43 we propose that the TMGa reacts with OH surface species to lose x CH3 ligands as CH4 according to nanopowder/uniFB01 lled grid was allowed to equilibrate at the deposition temperature under /uniFB02 owing UHP N2 for approximately 1 h and was then passivated with 5 cycles of Al O 2 3 ALD using TMA and H2O. The FTIR measurements are presented as di /uniFB00 erence spectra to accentuate the changes resulting from subsequent exposures. A spectrum was recorded after each precursor exposure, and the di /uniFB00 erence spectrum was generated by subtracting the previous spectrum. Consequently, positive absorbance features indicate the formation of new surface species, whereas negative absorbances indicate the removal of surface species.

$$x & - O H ( s ) + G a ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ( g ) \\ & \to ( - O - ) _ { x } G a ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 - x } ( s ) + x C H _ { 4 } ( g ) & & ( 1 ) & & H _ { 2 } O \\ & \quad \.$$

This mechanism assumes that CH4 is the only gas phase product formed when TMGa reacts with the surface, which was con /uniFB01 rmed by in situ QMS measurements as described below. Using the relationship R = Δ m / Δ m 1 , where Δ m is the mass change for one complete cycle and Δ m 1 is the mass change upon TMGa adsorption, the amount of CH3 ligands released, x , can be determined. On the basis of eq 1, Δ m = (1/2 Ga2O3) = 93.72 and Δ m 1 = (Ga) + (3 -x )(CH3) -x (H) = 114.72 -16 . x From Figure 1, R = 0.88 and x = 0.51, which implies that fewer than 1 of the 3 CH3 ligands is released during TMGa adsorption. This relatively small release of CH3 ligands is consistent with the preferential formation of dimethylgallium species on the surface, as has previously been reported for TMGa adsorption on silica 44 and alumina 45 surfaces.

In situ FTIR Measurements. Both the TMGa-H2O and TMGa-O3 processes were characterized using FTIR at a temperature of 350 ° C. Prior to the FTIR measurements, the

The di /uniFB00 erence spectra over the /uniFB01 rst /uniFB01 ve TMGa-H2O exposures are shown in Figure 2a. With the /uniFB01 rst TMGa exposure onto the Al2O3-coated surface, positive absorbances appear as broad peaks at 2975, 2915, and 1215 cm -1 . The 2975 and 2915 cm -1 features can be attributed to antisymmetric and symmetric C -H stretching modes, respectively, and the 1215 cm -1 feature can be attributed to a symmetric CH 3 deformation mode. The negative absorbance at 3730 cm -1 is attributed to the removal of hydroxyl groups. These features are all consistent with previously reported spectra for the adsorption of TMGa onto a hydroxylated Al2O3 surface. 45 With the /uniFB01 rst H2O exposure, positive absorbances emerge corresponding to the repopulation of hydroxyl groups and negative absorbances appear corresponding to the removal of CH3 ligands. However, the magnitude of the changes after the /uniFB01 rst H2O exposure are smaller than the corresponding changes observed with the /uniFB01 rst TMGa exposure, suggesting that the CH3 ligands are only partially removed by H2O. This pattern continues during subsequent TMGa-H2O exposures, and by the /uniFB01 fth cycle, practically no absorbance changes were observed. Evidently, successive TMGa-H2O exposures leave behind CH3 ligands that eventually passivate the surface and prevent the adsorption of TMGa. This behavior is consistent with our QCM measurements that showed a signi /uniFB01 cant mass gain during the /uniFB01 rst TMGa exposure onto an Al2O3 surface, but progressively smaller mass gains with repeated TMGa-H2O exposures. These FTIR measurements con /uniFB01 rm the /uniFB01 nding from QCM that Ga2O3 ALD is not possible using alternating TMGa-H2O exposures.

Careful inspection of the CH3 deformation feature (Figure 2b) reveals some clues regarding the lack of sustained Ga O 2 3 growth with H2O. The initial CH3 deformation feature at 1215 cm -1 is actually a superposition of two peaks at 1220 and 1209 cm -1 . H2O exposures remove only the peak at 1209 cm -1 . As a result, it is the remaining CH 3 groups associated with the 1220 cm -1 peak that cause the surface passivation. The exact nature of these two types of CH3 groups remains unclear. One possibility is that TMGa dissociates on the Al2O3 surface to form dimethylgallium species and Al-CH3 species. 45 As with conventional Al O3 2 ALD, the Al-CH3 bonds are easily removed by H2O, whereas the Ga-CH3 bonds persist and passivate the surface. Alternatively, in analogy with TMA adsorbed onto an Al2 O3 surface, the 1220 and 1209 cm -1 features may be associated with monomethylgallium and dimethylgallium features, respectively. 46 As with adsorbed TMA, the dimethyl species may be more reactive and removed by the /uniFB01 rst H2O exposure, while the monomethyl species are less reactive and remain on the surface. In any case, the persistent peak at 1220 cm -1 indicates that surface methyl species prevent Ga O 2 3 ALD using H2O.

The bottom trace in Figure 2a reveals that after 5 cycles of TMGa-H2O, a single ozone exposure produced signi /uniFB01 cant absorbance changes. The negative C -H stretching features at 2915 and 2975 cm -1 and the negative Ga-CH3 symmetric deformation feature at 1220 cm -1 demonstrate the removal of CH3 surface groups by ozone. This /uniFB01 nding is consistent with our QCM observation that ozone is an e /uniFB00 ective oxygen source for Ga2O3 ALD with TMGa. Additionally, ozone exposure resulted in positive absorbances at 3686 cm -1 that correspond to surface hydroxyl groups and at 1586 and 1372 cm -1 that correspond to formate groups. These formate groups persist even with ozone exposures of many minutes, indicating their relative stability on the surface. Surface formate groups have also been observed following the ozone exposures for Al2 O3 ALD using TMA and ozone. 40

Figure 3 shows di /uniFB00 erence spectra recorded after successive TMGa and O3 exposures. The consistent and repeated changes in absorbance associated with the O H, C --H, formate (F), and CH3 spectral features signal the exchange of surface functional groups expected for self-limiting surface chemistry. Furthermore, these di /uniFB00 erence spectra demonstrate that the

stable formate groups formed during the ozone exposures are successfully removed during the subsequent TMGa exposures.

To verify the net growth of Ga O3 2 with repeated TMGa-O3 exposures, we utilized a SiO2 nanopowder substrate that is transparent in the 800 -500 cm -1 region, where the bulk Ga O 2 3 modes are expected to appear. 47 Figure 4a shows that the FTIR absorbance (referenced to the initial substrate) in the 800 -500 cm -1 region increased with increasing Ga O 2 3 ALD cycles, and Figure 4b shows that the integrated absorbance of the Ga O 2 3 bulk modes increased linearly with ALD cycles as expected for layer-by-layer growth.

In situ QMS Measurements. QMS studies were conducted to identify the gaseous products of the TMGa and ozone surface reactions at 350 ° C. In these experiments, the TMGa and O3 precursors were each pulsed twice in succession in order to di /uniFB00 erentiate the QMS signals resulting from products of the ALD surface reactions from background QMS signals at the same mass to charge ( m e / ) ratio. We /uniFB01 rst performed a survey of all m e / values between 10 and 50. On the basis of this survey and the known cracking patterns, we determined that CH4 ( m e / = 15) and CH2O (formaldehyde, m e / = 29 and 30) were the only signi /uniFB01 cant gaseous products formed during Ga2O3 ALD. As shown in Figure 5, CH4 was the primary product observed during the TMGa exposures, whereas CH2O was the primary product observed during the ozone exposures. The release of CH4 is consistent with the dissociative adsorption of TMGa onto the Ga O3 2 surface and is similar to the CH4 released during the TMA exposures for Al2 O3 ALD using TMA and O3. 40 Consistent with the QCM and FTIR measurements, CH4 was only observed during TMGa exposures that followed an ozone exposure, because the other oxygen sources left the surface passivated with CH3 ligands and prevented the adsorption of TMGa and the associated release of CH . 4

The release of CH2O during the ozone exposures can be explained by the following surface reaction:

$$\Gamma _ { \L } = & \quad \ G a - \text{CH} _ { 3 } ( s ) + 2 O _ { 3 } ( g ) \\ \Gamma _ { \L } s \\ \L ), & & \quad \to G a - \text{OH} ( s ) + \text{CH} _ { 2 } O ( g ) + 2 O _ { 2 } ( g )$$

in which O3 reacts with CH3 ligands to form surface hydroxyls and CH2O. We postulate that O2 is formed in eq 2, but it was not possible to verify this hypothesis by QMS given the enormous background signals from O2 during the O3 exposures. The CH2O shown in eq 2 can desorb and become entrained in the carrier gas /uniFB02 ow so that it is sensed by the QMS, or the CH2O can readsorb onto the Ga2O3 to form a surface formate species. This mechanism is consistent with the FTIR results, in that it results in the formation of both hydroxyls and formates. Furthermore, previous FTIR studies have demonstrated the formation of surface formates via the exposure of metal oxides to CH2O. 40,48,49

Growth of ALD Ga2O3 Films. To evaluate the process conditions for saturated, self-limited growth, we deposited Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms with varied TMGa and ozone exposure times at both 250 and 350 ° C, and the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses were subsequently measured by ellipsometry. The TMGa saturation was assessed by using the timing sequence of x - - -5 6 5, whereas the ozone saturation was assessed using the timing sequence of 0.5 - - -5 x 5. As shown in Figure 6a, the Ga2O3 growth rate saturated with TMGa exposures as small as 0.5 s. However, the growth rate at 250 ° C was ∼ 20% lower than at 350 ° C. Figure 6b shows that the Ga O 2 3 growth rate at 350 ° C

saturated at 0.52 Å/cycle using ozone exposure times as short as 3 s, whereas the growth rate at 250 ° C required longer ozone exposures of at least 12 s to achieve a saturated growth rate of 0.52 Å/cycle. On the basis of the more rapid ozone saturation achieved at the higher temperature, we believe that the ozone reaction with the TMGa-terminated surface is the rate-limiting step for Ga O3 2 ALD. Moreover, the lower apparent saturation growth rate at 250 ° C in Figure 6a is explained by the subsaturating 6 s ozone exposures used for these measurements.

Figure 7 shows the Ga2O3 growth rate as a function of deposition temperature using a /uniFB01 xed TMGa-O3 timing sequence of 0.5 - - -5 6 5. The Ga2O3 growth rate is nearly constant at 0.52 Å/cycle between 300 and 375 ° C. The reduced growth rates observed below 300 ° C are attributable to the slower ozone reactions, such that 6 s ozone exposures were insu /uniFB03 cient to achieve saturation. However, by utilizing much longer ozone exposures, 24 s at 250 ° C and 72 s at 200 ° C, it was possible to achieve saturated growth at these reduced temperatures. The reduced growth rates above 375 ° C may result from the thermal decomposition of the TMGa or ozone precursors upstream of the sample substrates. For example, the onset of reduced growth rate is consistent with the onset of

Figure 6. Ga2O3 growth rate at 250 and 350 ° C as a function of (a) TMGa and (b) O3 exposures.

TMGa decomposition that has been previously reported. 50 -52 Lastly, the Ga2O3 growth rate of 0.52 Å/cycle measured by ellipsometry at 350 ° C is very similar to the value of 0.53 Å/ cycle determined from the QCM measurements. This close agreement lends con /uniFB01 dence to both measurements and indicates that the ALD Ga O3 2 has a similar density as bulk β -Ga2O3.

It is interesting to note that the Ga O 2 3 growth rate of 0.52 Å/ cycle is signi /uniFB01 cantly less than the typically observed 1.0 -1.2 Å/ cycle for TMA-H2O 27 or 0.8 Å/cycle for TMA-O3 53 at similar temperatures. Steric hindrance might explain this di /uniFB00 erence. TMA adsorbs onto ALD Al2O3 by losing ∼ 50% of its CH3 ligands. In contrast, our QCM measurements demonstrated that TMGa loses only ∼ 17% of its CH3 groups upon adsorption onto Ga2O3. The steric hindrance imposed by the remaining CH3 ligands may block the chemisorption of

additional TMGa and result in a lower Ga2O3 growth rate compared to the analogous Al2O3 ALD process. Alternatively, the lower growth rate may be attributed to the reduced reactivity of TMGa relative to TMA. Previous studies of TMGa adsorption onto metal oxide surfaces demonstrate reduced reactivity toward bridging oxygen sites compared to TMA. 44 As a result, TMA may have more reactive sites available per cycle (both surface hydroxyls and bridging oxygen sites) and a correspondingly higher growth rate. However, it should be noted that these studies of TMGa adsorption were conducted at 20 ° C and not the elevated temperatures being used for ALD, so direct comparison is di /uniFB03 cult.

It is also instructive to compare the TMGa-O3 process with previously reported Ga2O3 processes utilizing Ga(acac)3 and Ga2(N(CH3)2)6. The Ga(acac)3 process exhibits a narrow temperature window of 350 -375 ° C and a growth rate of 0.22 Å/cycle, 19,20 whereas the Ga2(N(CH3)2)6 process exhibits a temperature window of 150 -270 ° C and a growth rate of 1 Å/ cycle. 21 -23 At high temperatures, the TMGa process o /uniFB00 ers clear advantages over the Ga(acac)3 process, with a higher growth rate and larger temperature window. A direct comparison with the Ga2(N(CH3)2)6 process is less clear. Because of their di /uniFB00 ering temperature windows, these processes can best be considered complementary.

Lastly, the temperature window for Ga2O3 ALD is particularly important when considering the deposition of doped or mixed Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms for applications such as TCOs, phosphors, and GaAs dielectrics. Such deposition requires compatible temperature windows between Ga2O3 and dopant ALD processes. For Ga2O3, this window is primarily 300 -375 ° C for reasonable ozone exposure times ( ≤ 6 s). However, as demonstrated above, this temperature window can be extended to lower temperatures by using longer ozone exposures.

Properties of ALD Ga2O3 Films. To characterize the properties of ALD Ga2O3, we deposited /uniFB01 lms onto Si(100) and fused SiO2 substrates at 350 ° C using a timing sequence of 0.5 - - -5 3 5. The composition of the ALD Ga2O3 was evaluated by RBS using a 100 Å Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lm deposited onto Si(100). RBS showed that the /uniFB01 lms were stoichiometric asdeposited and had the expected Ga:O atomic ratio of 2:3 with no carbon within the 4 at% detection limit for RBS. The density of the ALD Ga2O3 was determined by RBS to be 6.31 × 10 22 atoms/cm 3 . Using the known thickness of 100 Å from ellipsometry, the Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lm density is 5.5 g/cm 3 , which is slightly lower than the β -Ga2O3 bulk density of 5.88 g/cm . As 3 will be demonstrated below, the ALD Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms are amorphous as-deposited, and this accounts for the lower density. Because of the limited ability of RBS to detect residual carbon within the /uniFB01 lm, XPS analysis was also conducted. After sputtering into the Ga O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm, XPS spectra revealed only Ga and O and no detectable carbon within the /uniFB01 lm. As a result, we conclude that the /uniFB01 lms are free of residual carbon from the ALD process.

The /uniFB01 lm morphology and conformality were characterized by SEM using 800 Å thick Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms deposited onto micromachined Si substrates with trenches 1.2 μ m wide and 13 μ m deep (aspect ratio = 11). As shown in Figure 8, the Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms are smooth and featureless, and they coat the entire trench structure. The Ga2O3 thickness decreases from 800 Å at the top of the trench to 550 Å at the bottom of the trench. The lower apparent growth rate at the bottom of the trench may result from thermal decomposition of the ozone at these relatively high growth temperatures 54 and would likely improve by using larger ozone exposures. For comparison, Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms deposited concurrently in trenches 5 μ m wide and 17 μ m deep (aspect ratio = 1.8) on the same micromachined substrate exhibited perfect conformality.

The phase of the ALD Ga2O3 was evaluated using XRD of 800 Å thick Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms deposited on fused SiO . As shown in 2

Figure 9, the as-deposited /uniFB01 lms were amorphous and exhibited no observable di /uniFB00 raction peaks, which is similar to ALD Ga O 2 3

/uniFB01 lms prepared using Ga(acac)3 19,20 and Ga2(N(CH3)2)6. 21 -23 After annealing at 900 ° C for 20 min under Ar, the /uniFB01 lms exhibited di /uniFB00 raction peaks characteristic of β -Ga2O3.

The optical properties of the as-deposited Ga O 2 3 /uniFB01 lms were determined using ellipsometry and optical transmittance measurements. Fitting the ellipsometric measurements from the ALD Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms using a Cauchy model provided the refractive index as a function of λ : n ( λ ) = 1.844 + 0.01249/ λ 2 + 0.000463/ λ 4 with n = 1.88 at 589 nm. These refractive index values are very similar to those reported for Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms prepared by other methods 13,14,55 and to bulk Ga2O3. 56 As shown in Figure 10, optical transmittance revealed that the Ga2O3 thin /uniFB01 lms are highly transparent between 300 and 2500 nm. The optical bandgap, E g , of the Ga O3 2 /uniFB01 lm was determined using the relationship α ν h = B h ( ν -E g ) , n where α is the absorption coe /uniFB03 cient as a function h ν , B is a constant, and n depends on the type of transition. 57 For these /uniFB01 lms, the best /uniFB01 t is obtained with n = 1/2, which is consistent with a direct bandgap. The E g is determined by plotting ( α ν h ) 2 versus energy and extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to zero. As shown in Figure 10b, this analysis reveals a bandgap of 4.95 eV, which is consistent with previous measurements of Ga O3 2 thin /uniFB01 lms deposited using other methods and bulk Ga2O3. 55 The excellent transmittance and high bandgap of the Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms makes them well-suited to both TCO and phosphor applications.

## ■ CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated a new process for the ALD of highquality Ga O3 2 thin /uniFB01 lms using TMGa and ozone. In situ QCM, FTIR, and QMS measurements revealed a growth mechanism in which TMGa dissociatively adsorbs onto the Ga2O3 surface to form Ga(CH3)2 surface species and liberates ∼ 20% of the methyl ligands as CH4. Next, the ozone reacts with these methyl species to form hydroxyl and formate surface groups and liberate CH2O. In contrast, Ga O 2 3 ALD using TMGa and H2O was not possible because the surface became poisoned by surface methyl species after only a few cycles and these methyl

species could not be removed by H O. Alternating exposures to 2 TMGa and ozone yielded a growth rate of 0.52 Å/cycle for deposition temperatures between 200 and 375 ° C. The Ga2O3 growth rate decreased at higher temperatures due to precursor thermal decomposition, and larger ozone exposures were required to achieve saturation at temperatures below 300 ° C because of the slow ozone kinetics. Analysis of Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms deposited with the TMGa-O3 process showed that the /uniFB01 lms are stoichiometric, free of residual carbon, and possess properties similar to bulk Ga O . Lastly, the Ga O 2 3 2 3 ALD process exhibits a temperature window that is compatible with many complementary ALD processes, which should enable various doped Ga2O3 /uniFB01 lms for applications including TCOs, phosphors, and dielectrics.
