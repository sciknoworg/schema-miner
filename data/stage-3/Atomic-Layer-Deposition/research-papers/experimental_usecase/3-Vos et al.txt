Mackus*Department of Applied Physics, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O. Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands*S Supporting InformationABSTRACT: This work investigates the role of the co-reactant for the atomic layer deposition of cobalt (Co) filmsusing cobaltocene (CoCp2) as the precursor. Three differentprocesses were compared: an AB process using NH3 plasma,an AB process using H2/N2 plasma, and an ABC process usingsubsequent N2 and H2 plasmas. A connection was madebetween the plasma composition and film properties, therebygaining an understanding of the role of the various plasmaspecies. For NH3 plasma, H2 and N2 were identified as themain species apart from the expected NH3, whereas for theH2/N2 plasma, NH3 was detected. Moreover, HCp wasobserved as a reaction product in the precursor and co-reactant subcycles. Both AB processes showed self-limiting half-reactions and yielded similar material properties, that is, highpurity and low resistivity. For the AB process with H2/N2, the resistivity and impurity content depended on the H2/N2 mixingratio, which was linked to the production of NH3 molecules and related radicals. The ABC process resulted in high-resistivityand low-purity films, attributed to the lack of NHx,x?3 species during the co-reactant exposures. The obtained insights aresummarized in a reaction scheme where CoCp2 chemisorbs in the precursor subcycle and NHx species eliminate the remainingCp in the consecutive subcycle.1. INTRODUCTIONAtomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin-film depositiontechnique, which relies on the cyclewise alternation ofprecursor and co-reactant doses. The self-limiting nature ofthe surface reactions during ALD generally allows for gooduniformity on large-area substrates and excellent conformalityon three-dimensional structures.1 Although the precursor thatis used for an ALD process generally receives considerableattention, the choice of the co-reactant is equally importantbecause it can greatly affect the properties of the depositedmaterial as well as the technological and industrial feasibility ofthe process. For the ALD of metals, a wide range of co-reactants have been explored, with gases or plasmas of O2, H2,and NH3 being the most common choices.1?4 In addition, lesscommon chemicals such as hydrazine (N2H4), silane (SiH4),disilane (Si2H6), formic acid (CH2O2), and tertiary butylhydrazine (C4H12N2) have been used.2,5?8 Moreover, certainALD processes make use of what can be referred to as anadvanced ALD cycle, in which either two or more co-reactantsare dosed simultaneously or after one another in an ABC-typemanner. For instance, mixed H2/N2 plasmas have been usedfor the ALD of a variety of materials.9?12 Furthermore,Ham?al?ai?nen et al. deposited Ir, Pd, Rh, and Pt at lowtemperatures (120?200 °C) using consecutive O3 and H2exposures, and similar ABC-type cycles were later reported forthe ALD of Ru (at 150 °C) using subsequent O2 and H2 dosesand for the ALD of Pt (at room temperature) using subsequentO2 and H2 plasmas.13?16H2-, N2-, and NH3-based plasmas (e.g., plasmas using NH3,H2, N2, or H2/N2 mixtures as source gases) have previouslybeen used as co-reactants for the ALD of a wide range ofmetals and metal nitrides. See Table S1 in the SupportingInformation for an overview of selected metals and metalnitrides, which have been deposited using a NH3 plasma or amixed H2/N2 plasma as the co-reactant. For instance, Kim etal. found that for the ALD of Ir using ((ethylcyclopentadienyl)-(1,5-cyclooctadiene)iridium), NH3 plasma yielded a lowersurface roughness in comparison to when using O2 gas as theco-reactant.17 Furthermore, Ten Eyck et al. employed a H2/N2plasma for the ALD of Pd on a polymer substrate and claimedthat a H2/N2 plasma leads to the formation of reactive NH2groups on the polymer, needed for chemisorption of thepalladium(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate precursor.10 More-over, the use of NH3 plasmas instead of H2 plasmas for theALD of Ru, Ag, and Ni resulted in higher growth per cycle(GPC) and lower resistivity values.18?20 The choice for the co-reactant is generally less straightforward for the ALD of Co, Ni,and Cu, as compared to noble metals, because their reductionpotential is lower, which makes impurity incorporation moreReceived: July 3, 2018Revised: August 10, 2018Published: September 5, 2018Articlepubs.acs.org/JPCCCite This: J.

However, for certain elements, theuse of N2, NH3, or H2/N2 plasmas and mixtures thereof canalso result in metal nitride films (e.g., AlN, TiN, andTaN).9,21?24 In general, deposition of a metal nitride becomesmore likely for metals with a low reduction potential, asillustrated in Table S1.4 Al, Ta, and Ti have reductionpotentials between ?0.6 and ?1.7 V, whereas for Co, Ni, andnoble metals, it is ?0.26 V or higher.25 Consequently, the useof, for instance, a mixed H2/N2 plasma leads to the depositionof AlN on one hand and metallic Co on the other hand.26Co is a ferromagnetic transition metal used in, for instance,magnetoresistive random-access memory and CoSi2 con-tacts.27?31 Currently, Co mostly receives much attention forapplications in interconnect technology, in order to reduce theresistance?capacitance delay in state-of-the-art devices.32 First,Co has been suggested as a viable candidate as the liner for Cuinterconnects because Co can be thinner than the conventionalTa liner, which leaves more space for Cu.33,34 Moreover, Co isalso being investigated for the replacement of Cu or W insmall-dimension interconnects in the front-end of line.35,36 It istherefore valuable to select Co ALD as a model system forstudying the influence of the co-reactant. A wide range ofprecursors and co-reactants have been investigated for theALD of Co, as shown in Table 1. As compared to otherprecursors, the bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt(II) (cobaltocene,CoCp2) precursor has previously given good results, that is, alow resistivity and high purity, while also being a readilyavailable and low-cost precursor. Interestingly, the ALD of Cousing CoCp2 as the precursor can be achieved using differentco-reactants. Specifically, the studies of Lee et al. and Yoon etal. reported the growth of high-quality Co films using NH3plasma and H2/N2 plasma, respectively.26,37 A directcomparison between the two different processes as well as aconnection between the plasma composition and the obtainedmaterial properties has not been made so far.In this work, a detailed study of the use of H2-, N2-, andNH3-based plasmas as co-reactants for the ALD of Co usingCoCp2 as the precursor is presented. As illustrated in Figure 1,three ALD processes with different co-reactants wereinvestigated: an AB-type process with NH3 plasma (referredto as AB-NH3 process, Figure 1a), an AB process with amixed H2/N2 plasma (AB-H2/N2 process, Figure 1b), and anABC process with subsequent N2 and H2 plasmas (ABC-N2-H2 process, Figure 1c). As will be shown, the separation of theH2 and N2 plasmas in an ABC-type cycle provides an insightinto the role of NHx,x?3 species that are present in both theNH3 plasma and the H2/N2 plasma (but not in the N2 or H2plasmas).This work is structured as follows. First, the experimentalconditions related to the film deposition, the plasma studies,and the film analysis are discussed. In Section 3.1, the speciespresent in the NH3 and H2/N2 plasmas are identified and theTable 1.

Note that each purge step is followed by a pump step (seeSection 2.1 under Experimental Section), which is not shown in thefigure for simplicity.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b06342J. Phys. Chem. C 2018, 122, 22519?2252922520role of the H2/N2 ratio on the plasma composition isinvestigated. This is followed in Section 3.2 by a study onthe reaction products released during the plasma exposures ofthe three different ALD processes. In Section 3.3, the obtainedmaterial properties are compared. In addition, the effect of theH2/N2 ratio and NHx,x?3 concentration in the plasma on thematerial properties are addressed. Next, the role of NHx,x?3species and a possible reaction mechanism are discussed inSections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Finally, the main conclusionsof this work are summarized.2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION2.1. ALD Reactor and Conditions. Co films weredeposited in a home-built ALD reactor, as described in theprevious work.49 In short, the reactor is equipped with aremote inductively coupled plasma source and a turbo pumpreaching a base pressure of ?10?6 Torr. During all experi-ments, the temperature of the substrate table was set to 300°C, whereas the walls were heated to 100 °C. Prior to allexperiments, the reactor wall was covered by Co by running atleast 200 cycles of the AB-NH3 process. The CoCp2 precursor(98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was contained in a stainless steelbubbler. The bubbler and the dosing line were heated to 80and 120 °C, respectively, as was previously found to beappropriate for the deposition of CoOx in the same reactor.50The ALD recipe consisted of precursor dosing for 6 s in thefirst subcycle, using Ar as a carrier gas, which resulted in achamber pressure of approximately 15 mTorr. Subsequently,the reactor was purged with Ar for 3 s and pumped down for 6s. All plasma exposures were performed at a power of 100 Wfor 11 s and were followed by a purge and a pump step of 1and 11 s, respectively. The NH3, N2, and H2 plasmas werestarted after flowing the source gas into the reactor for 3 s. Forthe AB-H2/N2 process, the N2 flow was started 2 s before theH2 flow, and subsequently after 5 s, the H2/N2 plasma wasignited. This was done to stabilize the gas flows and minimizeoverpressures. The precursor dosing and plasma exposuretimes were based on saturation studies as shown in theSupporting Information (Figure S1).The pressure used for the NH3 plasma was 1.5 mTorr. Forthe standard H2/N2 plasma, the N2 and H2 pressures wereseparately set to 1.5 and 15 mTorr, respectively. Because of theaddition of N2 to the H2 gas, the pumping speed increases (ascompared to only H2), leading to a lower total pressure ofapproximately 13 mTorr for the H2/N2 mixture. Moreover, theactual H2/(H2 + N2) mixing ratio is approximately ?0.77 (forthe H2 and N2 pressures of 1.5 and 15 mTorr, respectively)because of the shorter residence time of H2 as compared tothat of N2 (see also Section 3.1). The results for different H2/(H2 + N2) ratios in Sections 3.3 and 4.1 were obtained byvarying the partial pressures of H2 and N2, while keeping thetotal pressure of the mixture constant at 13 mTorr. For theABC-N2-H2 process, a pressure of 7.5 mTorr was used for boththe N2 and H2 plasmas, and both plasma exposures were 11 slong.To determine the effect of the H2/(H2 + N2) ratio on theNH3 production in Section 3.1, a constant pressure of 75mTorr was used for the gas mixture. This pressure was higherthan the standard 13 mTorr to allow for more accuratevariation of the gas flows and to enable mixing ratios higherthan 80 vol %. For a pressure of 13 mTorr, it is not possible tokeep the pressure constant for mixing ratios higher than ?80vol % because of the low gas flows used and because of changesin pumping speed upon mixing gas flows.2.2. Plasma Studies. Quadrupole mass spectrometry(QMS) measurements were performed using Pfeiffer VacuumPrisma QME-200 (mass-to-charge ratio m/z = 1?200),attached to the side of the ALD chamber. Measurementswere done with the substrate table, and reactor walls were keptat the standard temperatures of 300 and 100 °C, respectively.Note that a considerable part of the QMS signal can originatefrom the reactions at the reactor walls because the surface areaof the wall is significantly larger than the surface area of thesubstrate table. It was confirmed that growth also occurs at adeposition temperature of 100 °C, albeit at a lower GPC(?0.13 Å as compared to ?0.29 Å) and with a higher impuritycontent. Because the aim is to compare the three ALDprocesses with one another, the temperature differencebetween the wall and the table is considered to be of minorinfluence.For determination of the main species in the NH3 and H2/N2 plasmas, mass scans (i.e., ion current as a function of m/z)for masses 1?30 were used. These mass scans were collectedafter stabilization of the gas flows and plasma. The H2/(H2 +N2) mixing ratios were determined using the QMS ioncurrents at m/z ratios 2 and 14 (corresponding to H2+ and N+,respectively) from such mass scans. For a complete descriptionof this method, see the Supporting Information.The procedure for time-resolved QMS measurements wassimilar to the method as previously described by Knoops etal.51 In short, for m/z ? 40, four m/z ratios were measuredsimultaneously, of which one was always m/z = 40. This valuecorresponds to Ar+ and is used as reference. For m/z > 40,besides m/z = 40, only one other m/z ratio was followed permeasurement, in order to keep the signal-to-noise ratio optimalwhile maintaining a reasonable time resolution. Three differentcycles were studied using the QMS measurements: a normal(AB- or ABC-type) ALD cycle, a cycle without CoCp2 dosing(but with Ar carrier gas dosing), and a cycle without ignitingthe plasma(s) (see Figure S2). This was done to discernreaction products from the species present because of theprecursor dosing, source gas exposure, or plasma ignition. Foreach type of recipe, 10 cycles were performed, and only thesignals over the last nine were averaged, assuming the firstcycle can deviate because of the recipes performed previously.To further minimize the influence of previous cycles, every setof cycles was preceded by a cleaning step consisting of an O2plasma for 90 s, followed by a NH3 plasma for 120 s.Moreover, the purging and gas stabilization times wereextended as compared to the standard ALD cycle, in orderto separate the effects of pressure overshoots from the reactionproducts. See the Supporting Information (Figure S3) for amore detailed description and an example of the raw data thatis collected using this procedure.Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was performed using aUSB4000 spectrometer from OceanOptics, with a wavelengthrange of 180?1100 nm, mounted horizontally to the side ofthe plasma source.2.3. Film Analysis. For characterization of the depositedmaterial, Co films were grown on Si(100) coupons with 450nm thermal SiO2. Prior to deposition, the samples werecleaned in situ with an O2 plasma for 2 min. It was found thatunloading the samples after the deposition at a tabletemperature of 300 °C led to significant oxidation of the Cofilm. Therefore, the substrate table was cooled down from 300The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b06342J. Phys. Chem. C 2018, 122, 22519?2252922521to 100 °C after each deposition to minimize the oxidation.Although the effect of the table temperature was notinvestigated in detail in this study, the GPC and film puritywere found to decrease when the sample temperatures werelowered, which will be addressed in a follow-up publication.The depositions for generating the saturation curves(Supporting Information, Figure S1) were performed on anALD-grown Co seed layer to avoid nucleation effects. This Coseed layer was deposited by performing 400 cycles of thestandard recipe using NH3 plasma on a thermal SiO2 wafer,resulting in a film thickness of approximately 12 nm. Couponsof this seed layer were loaded into the reactor with the tabletemperature set to 100 °C. After heating the substrate table invacuum to the standard deposition temperature of 300 °C, thecoupons were treated with a NH3 plasma for 3 min to reducethe surface oxidation.The ALD growth was monitored in situ by spectroscopicellipsometry (SE) using a J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000Uellipsometer.52 The dielectric function of the deposited filmswas parameterized using a B-spline model.53 The Co filmmicrostructure was studied using transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) using JEOL ARM 200F, operated at 200kV. For the TEM analysis, a lamella was prepared using afocused ion beam (FIB) in a FEI Nova600i NanoLab. X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with aThermo Scientific KA1066 spectrometer, using monochro-matic Al K? X-rays with an energy of 1486.6 eV. For XPSdepth profiling, sputtering was carried out using Ar+ ions withan energy of 500 eV. In addition, four-point probe (FPP)resistivity measurements were done using a Keithley 2400Sourcemeter and Signatron probe.3. RESULTS3.1. Species in NH3 and H2/N2 Plasmas. The similaritiesand differences between the NH3 plasma and H2/N2 plasmawere identified by collecting mass spectra in the range m/z =1?30. As can be seen in Figure 2, both plasmas mainly containH2 (m/z = 2), N2 (m/z = 14 and 28), and NH3 (m/z = 15?17). However, the ratio between these species differs for thetwo plasmas, with the relative amount of NH3 being larger forthe NH3 plasma. The mass-to-charge ratios 15 and 16 couldcorrespond to NHx (x < 3) species formed in the plasma aswell as NHx species formed by the dissociation of NH3 in theQMS analyzer. However, NHx (x < 3) radicals present in theplasma are likely recombined before being detected in theQMS, indicating that the signals for m/z = 15?17 can mainlybe attributed to NH3. Although NHx (x < 3) species cannotdirectly be detected using the QMS, it can be assumed thatthey are present in the plasma as a consequence of dissociationof NH3.54 See also the Supporting Information (Table S2) forthe assignment of species to corresponding mass-to-chargeratios.By comparing the QMS spectrum for the source gas with thespectrum for the corresponding plasma, it becomes visiblewhich species are formed upon plasma ignition (see FigureS4). When a NH3 plasma is ignited, the signals for m/z ratios15, 16, and 17 decrease, whereas the signals at m/z = 2, 7, 14,and 28 increase. These observations indicate that part of theNH3 is dissociated, leading to the formation of both N2 andH2. Similarly, in a H2/N2 plasma, N2 and H2 are dissociatedupon plasma ignition, followed by the formation of NH3 (seeFigure S4b). NH3 production using a H2/N2 plasma occursmostly at the reactor walls because a three-body reaction in thegas phase is unlikely for the pressures used in this work.55,56The two plasmas were further compared using OESmeasurements (see Figure S5).57 The emission spectra forthe NH3 and H2/N2 plasmas were found to be very similar.Moreover, the emission peak at ?336 nm corresponds to theA3? ? ?3? transition of NH and was identified in the spectrafor both plasmas (Figure S5b), corroborating the presence ofNHx,x<3 species.58,59To study the composition of the H2/N2 plasma as a functionof the mixing ratio between the H2 and N2 gases, QMS spectrawere collected for different H2/(H2 + N2) ratios. The amountof NH3 species produced in the plasma was found to dependon the mixing ratio. Figure 3 shows the QMS ion currents atm/z ratios 16 and 17 as a function of the H2/(H2 + N2) ratiofor a constant chamber pressure of 75 mTorr. This pressure ishigher than the standard 13 mTorr used for the ALD process,as explained in Section 2.1. The m/z ratios 16 and 17correspond to NH2+ and NH3+, and their ion currents are ameasure for the amount of NH3 produced in the plasma.Figure 3 indicates a maximum in NH3 production around 60?Figure 2. QMS spectra for a NH3 plasma and a H2/N2 plasma. Themain plasma species (H2, N2, and NH3) are indicated in the figure.The NH3 pressure was 1.5 mTorr, whereas the H2/N2 pressure was13 mTorr.Figure 3. QMS ion current at m/z ratios 16 and 17 for H2/N2plasmas as a function of H2 fraction in the H2/N2 mixture. The H2/(H2 + N2) mixing ratios on the horizontal axis were determined usingthe ion currents at m/z ratios 2 and 14, corresponding to H2+ and N+(see the Supporting Information), before igniting the plasma. Thetotal chamber pressure was kept constant at 75 mTorr.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b06342J. Phys. Chem. C 2018, 122, 22519?225292252280% H2 in the H2/N2 mixture, in agreement with the previouswork.51,60 Interestingly, the optimum is found close to the ratiobetween N and H atoms in the NH3 molecule (0.75).60,61Because the plasma composition depends strongly on themixing ratio, selecting the H2/(H2 + N2) ratio is highlyimportant when using a H2/N2 plasma for ALD, as will also bediscussed later. On the basis of the optimum found in Figure 3,a H2/(H2 + N2) mixing ratio of ?0.77 was employed forfurther QMS studies and depositions using the AB-H2/N2process, unless specified otherwise.3.2. Reaction Products during Plasma Subcycle. Afurther insight into the use of NH3 and H2/N2 plasmas wasobtained by studying the reaction products formed during theALD cycles using time-resolved QMS measurements. First,QMS signals were collected for m/z ratios 40 (Ar+), 59 (Co+),and 66 (HCp+) during the precursor subcycle (Figure S6). Onthe basis of these results, it can be concluded that HCp(C5H6+, m/z = 66) is released as a product during theprecursor half-reaction. Second, QMS signals were recordedduring the co-reactant subcycles of the AB-NH3 process(Figure 4a), the AB-H2/N2 process (Figure 4b), and the ABC-N2-H2 process (Figure 4c). Measurements were done for anormal ALD cycle and for a reference cycle without CoCp2dosing, using plasma exposures of 11 s (see Figure S3).Differences between the signals for the two cycles indicate theformation of species as a consequence of the ALD reactions.Figure 4a shows the results collected during the plasmasubcycle of the AB-NH3 process. The signals for m/z ratios 17and 28 are very similar for the ALD cycle and thecorresponding reference cycle and are related to the mainplasma species, namely, NH3 and N2. The increase in ioncurrent for m/z = 28 and a decrease for m/z = 17 after plasmaignition correspond to the formation of N2 (m/z = 28), whichis a consequence of the dissociation of NH3 (m/z = 17). Thecurrent for m/z = 17 demonstrates a transient behavior, asNH3 is a sticky molecule and the NH3 flow does not stabilizewithin the time of the exposure.62 Meanwhile, the initial rise inion currents (at ?0 s) for m/z ratios 27, 39, and 66 uponplasma ignition for the (normal) ALD cycle can be attributedto the release of reaction products (see Table S2). This rise isnot observed for the reference cycle without CoCp2 dosing.The increase for m/z = 66, assigned to HCp+ (C5H6+), uponplasma ignition indicates the elimination of the Cp ring fromthe surface. A similar increase in ion current was observed form/z = 65 (C5H5+, data not shown). The detection of HCp+reveals that some of the Cp ligands are still present on thesurface after the CoCp2 subcycle. The mass-to-charge ratio 27corresponds to C2H3+ or HCN+ and m/z = 39 to C3H3+ orC2HN+. The presence of, for example, HCN and C2HN mightbe caused by the reaction of CxHy and NHx species in theplasma. The detection of C2H3+ and C3H3+ can be explainedby dissociative ionization of HCp in the QMS (see thecracking pattern in Figure S7) and/or by the formation ofC2H4 and C3H4 in the plasma because of dissociation of HCp.Such production channels can unfortunately not be distin-guished using the current experimental setup.The QMS results for the AB-H2/N2 process are shown inFigure 4b. The ion currents for m/z ratios 17 and 28 behavevery similar for the ALD cycle and the reference cycle andindicate the formation of NH3 (m/z = 17) and consumption ofN2 (m/z = 28) in the H2/N2 plasma. These findings are in linewith the QMS measurements discussed in Section 3.1 (and asshown in Figure S4). Note that the signal for m/z = 17continues to increase during the plasma exposure because ofthe sticky nature of NH3 and/or ongoing stabilization of theNH3 production.62 However, the current for m/z = 17 starts toFigure 4. Time-resolved QMS signals for m/z ratios 17 (NH3+), 28 (N2+), 27 (C2H3+, HCN+), 39 (C3H3+, HCN+), and 66 (C5H6+), collectedduring the plasma subcycle for the (a) AB-NH3 process, (b) AB-H2/N2 process, and (c) ABC-N2-H2 process. A normal ALD cycle and a referencecycle without the CoCp2 precursor dosing were measured, with plasma ignition for 11 s during both cycles (indicated with an arrow in the panelsfor m/z = 28). The H2/(H2 + N2) mixing ratio of the H2/N2 plasma was ?0.77.The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b06342J. Phys. Chem. C 2018, 122, 22519?2252922523drop after the plasma exposure, accompanied by a smallincrease in the signal for N2, indicating that no more N2 isbeing consumed. The ion currents for m/z ratios 27, 39, and66 for the ALD cycle increase when the plasma is started (at t? 0 s), similar to the data shown in Figure 4a. This increasecan be explained by the release of reaction products, as wasdiscussed for the AB-NH3 process.To examine the role of the NHx species in the plasma in thereaction mechanism, the H2/N2 plasma was replaced byseparated N2 and H2 plasma steps in an ABC-type cycle (seeFigure 1). The results for the ABC-N2-H2 process in Figure 4cshow that no NH3 was present during the N2 exposure, as canbe expected. Moreover, upon ignition of the N2 plasma (at t ?0 s), a minimal amount of HCp+ (m/z = 66) is detected(revealed by the small difference with the reference cycle),which is much smaller than for the AB-NH3 and AB-H2/N2processes. Upon ignition of the subsequent H2 plasma, a rise inion currents for both m/z = 17 and 28 (at t ? 32 s, observedfor the ALD cycle and also for the reference cycle) indicatesthat NH3 and N2 are released. However, the amounts arealmost negligible and are limited by the amount of nitrogen-containing species adsorbed to the substrate and reactor wallafter the N2 plasma exposure. The H2 plasma mostly leads tothe detection of C2H3+/HCN+ (m/z = 27) and C3H3+/C2HN+(m/z = 39) species and no significant amount of HCp+. Thelimited amount of HCp+ detected during both plasmaexposures indicates that the Cp ring is not eliminated as awhole but rather dissociated because of the interaction withthe plasmas.Comparison of the results for the three different ALDprocesses provides an insight into the similarities anddifferences in reaction mechanisms. Except for the differencesin plasma species (m/z = 17 and 28), the results in Figure 4a,bshow very similar reaction products for the AB-NH3 and AB-H2/N2 processes. These analogies between the two ABprocesses suggest a similar reaction pathway, where Cp ligandsare eliminated from the surface during both the precursor andplasma subcycle. QMS measurements for the ABC-N2-H2process show significant differences in terms of plasma speciesand reaction products (see Figure 4c), as compared to the ABprocesses, suggesting a different reaction pathway.3.3. Film Properties. Before characterization of thematerial properties, the ALD behavior of the two AB processeswas studied by determining the GPC as a function of theCoCp2 dosing and the plasma exposure times. As can be seenin Figure S1, both the precursor and co-reactant subcyclesdemonstrated a self-limiting behavior for the NH3 plasma aswell as for the H2/N2 plasma processes. Moreover, thesaturation curves for the two processes look very similar, in linewith the finding that the two AB processes show similarities interms of plasma composition and reaction pathways asdiscussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The GPC saturates to avalue of 0.29 ± 0.02 Å, which is slightly lower than thatreported by Kim and co-workers (0.48 Å).26,37The material properties for the three different ALDprocesses were investigated for the films deposited using1000 cycles. A film deposited using the AB-NH3 process wasinvestigated using TEM after preparation of a lamella using aFIB. The cross-sectional images in Figure 5 reveal that the filmis polycrystalline and the crystal grains can clearly be observed.The film forms a closed layer of approximately 29 nm thick andhas a low roughness. SE modeling yielded a film thickness of?32 nm. The difference between the thicknesses derived fromSE and TEM is thought to be due to the film roughness, whichis not included in the SE modeling.The material properties obtained using the differentprocesses are shown in Table 2. As can be seen, for both theAB-NH3 and the AB-H2/N2 process, the film thickness(determined using SE) is ?25 nm after 1000 cycles,corresponding to an average GPC of approximately 0.25 Å.It is noted that the sample prepared for the TEM analysis wasdifferent from the sample listed in Table 2 and the filmthickness was slightly higher. The ABC-N2-H2 process resultedin an average GPC as high as 0.44 Å. The films deposited usingthe AB-NH3 and AB-H2/N2 processes both d
