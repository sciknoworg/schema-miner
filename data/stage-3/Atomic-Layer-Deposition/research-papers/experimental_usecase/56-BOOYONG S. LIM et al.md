Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a process for depositing highly  uniform  and  conformal  thin  films  by  alternating exposures  of  a surface  to  vapours  of  two  chemical reactants. ALD processes have been successfully demonstrated for many metal compounds, but for only very few pure metals. Here we demonstrate processes for the ALD of transition metals including copper, cobalt, iron and nickel. Homoleptic N N , ′ -dialkylacetamidinato metal compounds and molecular hydrogen gas were used as the reactants. Their surface reactions were found to be complementary  and  self-limiting,  thus  providing  highly uniform  thicknesses  and  conformal  coating  of  long, narrow holes. We propose that these ALD layers grow by a hydrogenation  mechanism  that  should  also  operate during the ALD of many other metals. The use of water vapour  in  place  of  hydrogen  gas  gives  highly  uniform, conformal  films  of  metal  oxides,  including  lanthanum oxide.  These  processes  should  permit  the  improved production of many devices for which the ALD process has previously not been applicable.

U niform,conformal thin films have a wide variety of applications in modern technology,including semiconductor microelectronics , 1 displays, optical filters, magnetic information storage and catalysis. One method that is particularly suitable for making uniform conformal layers is atomic layer deposition (ALD),also known as atomic layer epitaxy . An ALD process deposits thin layers of solid materials by 2 using two or more different vapour-phase reactants. First, a dose of vapour from one precursor is brought to the surface of a substrate onto which a film is to be deposited.Then any excess unreacted vapour of that reactant is pumped away. Next, a vapour dose of the second reactant is brought to the surface and allowed to react, and the excess is pumped away. This  cycle  of steps  normally  deposits  a  monolayer  or  less  of material, although  one  case  of a  multilayer  ALD  process  has  been reported .These cycles can be repeated to build up thicker films. 3

Two particularly important aspects of an ALD process are that the surface reactions must be complementary and self-limiting. Complementarity of the surface reactions means that each of the two reactants must prepare the surface for its reaction with the other vapour, so that the deposition cycles can be repeated. Self-limiting means that the  amount ofmaterial deposited in each ofthe reaction steps  is  uniform over the surface, provided that at least a minimum, that is, saturating, amount reaches each part of the surface. Because of this self-limiting character,ALD reactions produce coatings with very uniform thickness even if the flux of vapour is distributed non-uniformly over the surface. The uniformity of an ALD film thickness extends not only over flat substrate surfaces but also into very narrow holes and trenches; that is, the films are highly conformal .ALD reactions also ensure reproducible 4 control of thickness,by counting the number of reaction cycles.

ALD  processes  have  been  developed  for  many  metal  oxides, sulphides, nitrides and fluorides . Many potential applications of ALD 5 are, however, frustrated by the lack of ALD processes for most pure metals. Tungsten 6,7 , ruthenium 8 and platinum 9 are the only metals that have  been  successfully  deposited  from  molecular  precursors  by complementary, self-limiting ALD reactions. ALD copper 10 grew only on platinum substrates. ALD  of titanium 11 , tantalum 12,13 and aluminium 14 uses atomic hydrogen as a reactant, which limits the step coverage attainable in  deep  trenches  because  of the  rapid  recombination of hydrogen atoms on surfaces. It is also difficult to design an ALD apparatus to deliver hydrogen atoms over large substrate areas without plasma damage to the substrates and without causing long cycle times because of inefficient paths for gas flow.

We now report ALD of the transition metals iron,cobalt,nickel and copper  by  complementary, self-limiting  reactions, using  molecular

hydrogen gas and vapours of previously unreported metal acetamidinate  compounds. ALD  using  water  vapour  in  place  of hydrogen  gas  produced  the  oxides  of these  transition  metals  and lanthanum oxide. Similar processes should be applicable to numerous other metals and metal oxides throughout the periodic table.The metal acetamidinates  were  prepared  by  the  reaction  of lithium NN , ′ -dialkylacetamidinate with the appropriate metal chloride 15 . Selected properties of the acetamidinates are given in Table 1.A typical formula and structure are given in Fig. 1 for the case of bis( NN , ′ -diisopropylacetamidinato)cobalt(II). Details of the synthesis  and properties of these new compounds will be reported elsewhere 16 .All the compounds in Table 1 are monomeric except for copper, which is a dimer, and silver, which is a mixture of dimers and trimers.All of these precursors  are  sufficiently  volatile  for  use  as  vapour  sources  at temperatures below 130 °C.

thickness did not change for doses above about 1.5 × 10 -9 mol cm -2 . In the second method, the growth rate per cycle also saturated with increasing dose time at  a  fixed  dose  rate,as  illustrated  by  the  data  for  Cu  in Fig. 3;saturation was achieved for Cu precursor dose times of more than 2 s, during which time 4 × 10 -9 mol cm -2 was delivered.These results show that these metal precursors undergo self-limiting reactions with metal  surfaces  prepared  by  reaction  with  hydrogen. Saturation  also occurs for increasing hydrogen dose,as illustrated in Figs 2 and 3, but at much higher doses than required for the metal precursors.

As expected in an ALD process, all the metal films from saturating doses were deposited with uniform thickness along the whole length of the deposition zone. Doses less than the saturating values coated only the  inlet  region  of the  reactor  with  the  same  saturated  thickness. This observation shows that the reactions of the metal precursors with the surface are rapid, in agreement with the modest exposures needed for saturation (Table 2). In contrast, under-saturating doses of hydrogen  produced  thinner  films  over  the  whole  deposition  zone, showing that the reaction of hydrogen with the surface is slower than the reactions of the  metal  precursors.This  observation  corroborates  the  fact that much higher hydrogen exposures are needed to saturate the ALD reactions (Table 2).

The saturated thickness grew linearly with the number of cycles,as shown  in  Fig. 4  for  Co  films, demonstrating  the  complementary nature of the reactions.The zero intercept at the origin in Fig. 4 shows that there is no delay before film growth starts. Films nucleated and grew on ultraviolet-ozone-treated silicon, glassy carbon, glass and ALD tungsten nitride (WN)-coated substrates 17 , except for copper, which did not nucleate or grow on air-exposed WN unless it was precoated with cobalt.

For all the metal films studied (Fe, Co, Ni and Cu), both the metal precursor and the hydrogen reactions are self-limiting.Saturation of the growth  rate  was  shown  in  two  different  ways: increasing  the  dose delivered during a fixed time,and increasing the lengths of time at a fixed delivery  rate.The  first  method  is  illustrated  by  the  data  for  cobalt  in  Fig. 2, in  which  the  Co  precursor  dose  was  delivered  during  1 s  from  the precursor reservoir  at  various  temperatures  in  the  range  50-75 °C;the  Co

Figure 5a shows the temperature dependence of the deposition rate for the Co ALD process. Deposition on substrates between 260 and 350 °C  showed  ideal  ALD  behaviour  (self-limiting, complementary reactions). No  films  were  formed  at  substrate  temperatures  below 260 °C.This behaviour is very convenient for preventing unwanted film deposition on warm reactor walls kept between 65 °C (the vaporization temperature ofthe precursor) and 260 °C.Control experiments with no hydrogen showed no film deposition on substrates in the temperature range tested (250-350 °C).ALD of copper showed no deposition below 180 °C  (Fig. 5b), indicating  that  reactor  walls  held  at  temperatures between 95 and 180 °C remain free of unwanted deposits.Films of other

The degree of oligomerization is based either on an X-ray determination of the crystal structure or on the melting point depression of a solution in p -xylene.The yield is the percentage of the metal atoms in the starting metal halide that remain in the purified compound.The vapour pressure is based on the conditions required for sublimation.

metals and metal oxides  were  deposited  by  analogous  ALD  experiments, under the conditions given in Table 2.

The films were found to be pure metal or metal oxide by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS).The stoichiometries of the metal oxides reported in Table 2 were determined by RBS.The densities of the films were found to be very close to the bulk values by combining RBS data (number of atoms per unit area) and thicknesses from atomic force microscopy (AFM) on etched steps.The Fe,Co,Ni and Cu films are shiny metallic and specular in reflection, and are electrically conductive. For example, a 40-nm-thick cobalt film has a resistivity of 46 µ ohmcm,even though the surface ofthe film is oxidized in air. Even very thin cobalt (0.8 nm) and copper (7 nm) films on glass  are  conductive,indicating  that  the  nucleation  density  is  very high so that the films coalesce at an early stage of growth.(The resistances of the copper films were measured in situ to avoid oxidation.) The Fe,Co and Ni films are ferromagnetic. Typical hysteresis curves are included in the Supplementary Information.

The metal films are polycrystalline. X-ray diffraction data for a Cu film deposited at 250 °C (Supplementary Information) show that its

crystallites are predominantly oriented with their (111) axes normal to the surface.The Fe,Co and Ni films have very smooth surfaces as shown by AFM (r.m.s. roughness = 0.8 nm for a 15-nm-thick Co film). Cu films were rougher (r.m.s. roughness = 6 nm for a 40-nm-thick Cu film) probably because of their low nucleation density on glass  or  SiO .The  roughness  of a  Cu  film  was  reduced  to  2 nm  and  the 2 grain  size  decreased  from  47 nm  to  28 nm  by  using  ALD  Co  as  a substrate  on  which  the  nucleation  density  of Cu is  higher  (Fig. 6). The cobalt was also found to increase the adhesion strength of the Cu: a Cu/Co bilayer, deposited on an ALD WN diffusion barrier 17 passed a tape adhesion test. The cobalt layers could be handled or stored in ambient air,and the cobalt still functioned as an effective adhesion layer for  ALD copper.The surface oxide on cobalt was reduced to cobalt metal by exposure to molecular hydrogen in the heated reactor just before ALD of copper. ALD of the structure Cu/Co/WN is a promising way

to meet the future requirements of the semiconductor industry for the deposition of copper conductors on a conformal seed/adhesion/ barrier layer.

The  metal  films  are  highly  conformal. Figure 7  shows  a  crosssectional scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of holes with an aspect ratio of about 10:1 coated conformally with cobalt (10 nm) and then copper (40 nm).Holes with an even  higher  aspect  ratio,greater  than  40:1, were coated with Co and then cleaved to show a cross-section of the coated holes. An SEM showed that the walls of the narrow hole are covered with a conformal coating.T o test still higher aspect ratios,a fused silica capillary tube with an inner diameter of 20 µ m was used as a test structure.The metal coating on the outside of the capillary tube was then removed by burning off the protective polyimide coating on the tube.

The total pressure (including the nitrogen carrier gas) during depositions was about 0.3 torr.The 'dose' is the amount of precursor that was supplied in each cycle to complete the reaction with the surface. The 'exposure' is the flux of precursor to the surface that causes the reaction with the surface to go to completion.The exposure is thus inversely related to the speed of the reaction between the precursor and the surface.The units of exposure are pressure multiplied by the duration of exposure.When the pressure units are torr and the time units are microseconds, the units of exposure are called Langmuirs.

Then the tube was filled with a fluid whose refractive index matched that ofthe fused silica  tubing,to  render  the  uncoated  part  of the  hole  invisible. An optical microscope was used to image the film inside of the tube, demonstrating a cobalt coating inside a hole with an aspect ratio of 220:1 (Supplementary Information).To coat this hole ofvery high aspect ratio, a higher exposure was needed .We used about 1.1 4 × 10 5 Langmuirs per cycle  for  the  cobalt  precursor  and  2.9 × 10 7 Langmuirs  per  cycle  of hydrogen. Valves were open for 1 s to deliver each dose of precursor. The transport of precursor down this capillary tube is by molecular diffusion,just as  in  the  submicrometre  40:1  holes  in  the  wafer  mentioned above, because  at  the  process  pressure  (about  0.3 torr), the  mean free path of molecules is much larger than the 20 µ m diameter of the capillary tube.

The ALD growth rates of the metals described here are low but are still within a practical range for use in applications requiring thin films. For example, a cobalt adhesion layer between a diffusion barrier and a copper  seed  layer  could  be  about  a  nanometre  thick. Similarly, microelectronic interconnects require copper seed layers about 5-10 nm thick for electrodeposition of copper onto the sidewalls of holes  and  trenches. Even  thinner  copper  layers  are  sufficient  for initiating chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or electroless (chemical reduction from liquid solution) copper deposition. Magnetic layers required for magnetic memory are usually only about 1-7 nm thick. The ALD processes described here can produce these thicknesses with a throughput sufficient for practical use in the semiconductor industry.

More evidence will be needed to formulate a detailed mechanism for these ALD processes. However, it is well known that molecular hydrogen dissociates as  it  chemisorbs  on  clean  transition  metal  surfaces without any appreciable activation energy (except for copper, which does have an activation energy of about 60 kJ mol -1 ) 18 . The increasing growth rate for cobalt as a function of growth temperature (Fig. 5) suggests that hydrogen adsorption is not the rate-determining step. A similar temperature dependence has been observed for ALD of W (refs 6, 7) and Ru (ref. 8) metals, even though the chemistry of these ALD processes is quite different.During the  ALD of the pure metals,the chemisorption of the metal acetamidinate precursors must involve the chemisorbed hydrogen atoms, because without the hydrogen pretreatment the metal precursors do not chemisorb on the clean metal surfaces, as  shown  by  quartz  crystal  microbalance  measurements in situ . The chemisorbed hydrogen atoms then react with the metal precursors to cleave the metal-ligand bonds;this step might involve an energy  barrier  that  contributes  to  the  temperature  dependence  in Fig. 5.In addition,the released ligands are at least partly hydrogenated, because some lines in the NMR spectra of the volatile reaction byproducts can be assigned to hydrogenated ligands.In the metal oxides,

water creates a hydroxylated surface 19 with which the metal precursors react. We found that these metal acetamidinates are very reactive with water vapour, so their rapid reaction with a hydroxylated surface is a plausible  step  in  the  formation  of the  metal  oxides  and  also  the nucleation step in metal film growth.

We conclude that the surface reactions of metal acetamidinates and molecular  hydrogen  or  water  vapour  are  self-limited  and  complementary, permitting the ALD of many metals and metal oxides. Because of their outstanding uniformity and extreme conformality, we expect that the ALD coatings introduced here will find many new applications.
