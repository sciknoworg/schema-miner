It was proven that the formation of such heterostructures is ben-eficial for the separation of photo-gener-ated excitons (holeelectron pairs).[13,14,16,17] In particular, MoS2/TiO2 heterostructures have attracted significant interest, as MoS2 can be used as a photosensitizer for chemically stable but wide-bandgap TiO2 semiconductor.[18] The respective bandgap edge positions of the two semiconduc-tors form a charge-transfer cascade, which significantly increases the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.[19,20] Overall, both the photosensitizing proper-ties of MoS2 and the electronic structure of the heterojunction create a suitable plat-form for UV and visible light utilization resulting in high PEC performance.It should be noticed that the electronic and catalytic properties of MoS2 are highly dependent on the film thickness and mor-phology,[21] as well as the architecture of the substrates.[22,23] Therefore, various nanostructured architectures of TiO2 (e.g., TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes) have been applied as a scaffold to construct MoS2/TiO2 heterostructures because the increased surface area can efficiently promote their (photo)electrochem-ical performance.[7,1620] However, these general synthesis methods (e.g., hydrothermal synthesis, chemical vapor deposi-tion, chemical exfoliation, etc.) suffer from the limitation of the complicated synthesis process, poor film thickness control and uniform coverage on high aspect ratio structures,[17,19,20,24,25] which seriously suppress the investigation and promotion of A thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to fabricate MoS2 thin films is successfully demonstrated by using cycloheptatriene molybdenum tricar-bonyl (C7H8Mo(CO)3) and H2S as precursors at an ALD temperature below 300 °C. The process is systematically investigated, showing a typical self-limiting characteristic within an ALD temperature window of 225285 °C and a high growth-per-cycle of 0.11 nm. The as-deposited films are amorphous while they can be crystallized in situ by sulfurization with H2S at a low tem-perature of 300 °C. A prototypical application of the developed ALD process is demonstrated by constructing a MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure through depos-iting MoS2 onto anodized TiO2 nanotubes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The MoS2/TiO2 heterostructures exhibit approximately three times superior photoelectrochemical performance than the pristine TiO2 nanotubes. This is attributed to an enhanced visible light-harvesting ability of MoS2 and an improved separation of the photo-generated charge carriers at the hetero-structure interface, which is affirmed by a staggering gap (type II) between MoS2 and TiO2 as probed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.C.

IntroductionMolybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with an intrinsic semicon-ducting property, has attracted considerable interest and has been widely applied in various areas such as field-effect transistors, phototransistors, gas sensors, and (photo)elec-trocatalysts.[17] Particularly, MoS2 has become a desirable candidate in photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications due to its tunable bandgap and excellent visible light-harvesting ability.[6,811] Besides pure MoS2,[6] plenty of MoS2-based hetero-structures, like MoS2/ZnO,[12] MoS2/WS2,[13] MoS2/WSe2[14] and © 2022 The Authors.

Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbHthe catalytic properties of MoS2.[26] Therefore, it is extremely meaningful and challenging to deposit well-controlled MoS2 onto high aspect ratio nanostructured substrates for promoted PEC performance.Atomic layer deposition (ALD), an advanced film deposition technique, has attracted great interest in preparing high-quality films such as metal oxides, nitrides, and chalcogenides because of its high conformality and precise control of film thick-ness.[27,28] Compared to other synthesis routes, ALD shows great advantages in depositing high-quality films onto complex nano-structures with uniform coverage due to its self-limiting surface reactions.[27] Up to now, MoS2 has been fabricated by ALD with different metal precursors, such as Mo(CO)6,[2931] MoCl5,[32] Mo(thd)3 (thd = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dionato),[33] tetrakis(dimethylamino)molybdenum ((NMe2)4Mo),[34] and bis(t-butylimino)bis(dimethylamino)molybdenum ((NtBu)2(NMe2)2Mo).[35] The chemisorption of a molybdenum precursor species onto the surface is critical for the second ALD half-reac-tion. However, incomplete coverage during the metal precursor half-reaction is often attributed to a limited number of reactive sites on the surface and the steric hindrance of chemisorbed precursors on adjacent active sites. In some cases, pre-treat-ment or enrichment of the surface-active species is essential for improving ALD processes.[36,37] Thus, precursors which promote facile adsorption onto substrates may greatly improve ALD processes.[38]Mo(CO)6 is one of the most commonly used Mo precursors for ALD, given its high volatility at low temperatures and small ligands. In addition, facile chemisorption of Mo(CO)6 proceeds via a series of decarbonylation reactions to yield the subcar-bonyl surface species Mo(CO)x (x  ?  5), which can occur even at room temperature.[39,40] Due to the excellent surface coverage of the chemisorbed Mo(CO)x and small steric hindrance caused by carbonyl ligands, the ALD processes for MoS2 films from Mo(CO)6 show high growth per cycle (GPC) of up to 0.11 nm at as low temperature as 155  °C.[29,41,42] However, the low thermal stability of Mo(CO)6 results in a narrow ALD window of 155175 °C, which restricts its use in practical applications, particularly in preparing multinary dichalcogenides compo-nents like MoxW1-xS2.[30,31,4244] Compared to the carbonyl group, the Mo complexes with some alternative ligands such as alkyla-mides and diketonates show efficiently improved thermal sta-bility, thus broadening the ALD window. For example, the ALD of MoS2 from (NtBu)2(NMe2)2Mo exhibits a broad ALD window of 125225  °C and 275350  °C for that from Mo(thd)3.[33,45] However, these precursors exhibit lower growth per cycle (0.08 nm for (NtBu)2(NMe2)2Mo and 0.0025 nm for Mo(thd)3), which can be ascribed to the lower density of precursor mole-cules in the chemisorption layer.[38] Therefore, we come up with the idea that a heteroleptic molybdenum precursor bearing both carbonyl and substitutive ligands may be a promising ALD precursor since it integrates properties of both facile adsorption and better thermal stability.Ideal representatives are heteroleptic complexes composed of both carbonyl and cycloalkene ligands, which possess better thermal stability and higher volatility than the components containing only carbonyl groups.[4648] Therefore, molyb-denum complexes with these ligands have been considered as good candidates for the ALD of molybdenum oxides and nitrides.[48] For instance, cycloheptatriene molybdenum tricar-bonyl (C7H8Mo(CO)3), a heteroleptic molybdenum carbonyl complex with cycloalkene ligand,[49,50] has been applied for the vapor synthesis of MoO3 at low temperature (100 °C) due to its high volatility, indicating a good potential for applying as ALD precursor.[51]Herein, a low-temperature ALD process was demon-strated for the deposition of MoS2 from C7H8Mo(CO)3 and H2S, respectively. Besides planar substrates (e.g., Si, 350  nm thermally oxidized SiO2/Si, sapphire wafer, and glass), MoS2 was also successfully deposited onto high aspect ratio substrates such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and anodized titanium dioxide nanotube arrays (TiNTs). The crystallinity and purity of the as-deposited MoS2 films are efficiently improved by an in situ post-deposition sulfuriza-tion at 300  °C with H2S. Furthermore, MoS2/TiNTs hetero-structures exhibit a trifold enhanced photoelectrochemical performance under visible light irradiation compared to pristine TiNTs. Compared to visible light irradiation, the heterostructures also display an improved PEC performance under UV excitation, but within a lower number of optimal ALD cycles applied for the highest PEC performance since they exhibit different excitation models and charge-transfer pathways. Finally, the electronic structure of the MoS2/TiNT heterostructures and the charge-transfer mechanisms are systematically discussed.2. Results and Discussion2.1. MoS2 ALD Process DevelopmentThe ALD process was systematically studied in a homemade ALD reactor at a temperature ranging between 175 and 300 °C. CNTs, Si wafer, thermally oxidized SiO2/Si wafer, sapphire, and glass were utilized as substrates for the deposition. Figure  1a shows the thickness of the deposited films on the Si wafer for 100 ALD cycles as a function of the reaction temperature. For the reaction temperature of 175 °C, there is almost no MoS2 deposi-tion, which could be attributed to slow reaction thermodynamics between C7H8Mo(CO)3 and H2S at such a low temperature. While the temperature increases, the film thickness increases to 3 nm at 200 °C, and ?9 nm at 225 °C for 100 ALD cycles. Then it stays constant at ?9 nm until the reaction temperature reaches 285  °C, indicating an optimal ALD window for the reaction between 225 and 285  °C. While temperature further increases up to 300 °C, the film thickness decreases, probably on account of the desorption of the precursors from the substrates. The MoS2 films deposited onto thermally oxidized SiO2/Si wafers at varying temperatures were investigated by atomic force micros-copy (AFM, Figure S1, Supporting Information). The AFM results show that the as-deposited films exhibit a low root-mean-square surface roughness of ?2  nm for the films deposited at 250 °C (Figure S2, Supporting Information), indicating that the deposited films are rather smooth. Therefore, to keep low film roughness, the following ALD process was carried out at 250 °C, at the temperature in the middle of the ALD window.The dose and exposure time of the precursors were further studied at 250 °C.

Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbHthe film thickness with 50 ALD cycles as a function of the H2S exposure time, which varied from 0 to 60 s. The results suggest that the second half-reaction is saturated when the exposure time of H2S was set to 30  s. Figure  1c,d shows the effect of dose and exposure time of C7H8Mo(CO)3 on the film thick-ness after 50 ALD cycles. The results indicate that a minimum dose time of 0.75  s (Figure  1c) and exposure time of 10  s for C7H8Mo(CO)3 are required to complete the self-limiting surface reaction during the first half cycle (Figure 1d). Considering the large steric requirements of the metal precursor and the slow saturation, the optimal ALD parameters, dose/exposure/purge time, have been defined as 1.5  s/40  s/30  s for C7H8Mo(CO)3 and 0.2 s/30 s/30 s for H2S, respectively.The relationship between film thickness and the number of ALD cycles at 250  °C is shown in Figure  1e,f. Figure  1e shows the original spectroscopic ellipsometry data recorded on natively oxidized Si wafers. The curves gradually shift to lower delta values with the increase of the ALD cycles, indicating an increase in the film thickness. The film thickness increases linearly (R2  =  0.99) with a growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.11  nm (Figure  1f). All in all, the results presented in Figure  1 dem-onstrate angstrom-scale control of the thickness of the films deposited with our new process and its self-limiting nature. Noticeably, the GPC of this novel process is higher than the GPC we recently reported for MoS2 from (NtBu)2(NMe2)2Mo and H2S (0.08  nm).[45] Additionally, MoS2 films were success-fully deposited with the established ALD process on a glass substrate with an area of 5 ×  2.5  cm2, indicating the potential for large-scale fabrication (Figure S3, Supporting Information).The chemical composition of the as-deposited films was inves-tigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A typical survey spectrum shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information) confirms the presence of oxygen, molybdenum, carbon, sulfur in the sample, and silicon from the underlying substrate. The Mo 3d spectra consist of one doublet at ?229 and ?232 eV with a 3.15 eV separation, corresponding to Mo4+ (Figure 2a).[52] A second dou-blet at ?233 and 236 eV can be assigned to the Mo6+ of MoO3. This higher BE peak is more pronounced in the films deposited at 250 and 275  °C, which could be attributed to the increased Figure 1. a) The film thickness of the MoS2 film deposited at different temperatures ranging from 175 to 300 °C.

Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbHsurface roughness (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information) that could lead to faster oxidation of the as-deposited film when it is exposed to air. The S 2p spectra suggest that the as-deposited films contain a larger amount of ?S22  or S0 species (Figure  2b), which indicates the presence of amorphous MoS3 or unreacted sulfur,[9,48] similar to MoS2 previously grown by low-tempera-ture ALD.[43,45,53] Furthermore, the C 1s spectra of the deposited films were recorded before and after Ar sputtering, as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). All samples show carbon on the surface of the films, whilst almost no carbon signal can be observed after sputtering. This indicates that the ligands of C7H8Mo(CO)3 were entirely removed during the ALD process, and the detected carbon is typical surface contamination.Based on the growth parameters, self-limiting nature of the process, and available inorganic chemistry literature on molyb-denum complexes, we propose a growth mechanism to further understand the potential of our new ALD process.[30,46,54]First, C7H8Mo(CO)3 chemisorbs on the surface of pris-tine substrates (here depicted as ?OH species) or onto the growing MoSx, similar to most ALD reactions using Mo(CO)6 as molybdenum precursor, resulting in a substituted molyb-denum surface species,C H Mo COMoC H 3CO g 3/2 g7 8 37 8OH OH3 32( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )? + = ?? + + (1a)orC H Mo CO MoC H CO3 CO g 3 /2 g( ) 7 8 3 7 8 xx xxOH OH3 x 32( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )? + = ? ?+ ? + ?? ? (1b)Here, the black OH group refers to the active site on the initial surface of substrates.Then, the rest organic ligands are fully released when the co-reactant H2S reacts with the adsorbed surface species and then producing MoSx. Thermodynamics calculations have indicated that the reaction of H2S with various valence molybdenum species (e.g., metallic Mo and MoO3) under our experimental conditions has a negative Gibbs free energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable process.[55] Therefore, the second half-reaction could be proposed asMoC H H S MoSH C H g 1/2H g7 8 27 8 2O O3 3( ) ( )( ) ( )? ? + = ? ?? + + (2a)orMoC H CO H SMo SH C H g 1 x /2H g xCO g7 8 x 27 8 2O O3 x 3( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )? ? + = ?? ? + + + +?

First, the absorption of molybdenum components on the surface is critical for the full ALD reaction. It has been demonstrated that Mo(CO)6 is easily physisorbed on surfaces and decarbonylated to form chemisorbed molybdenum subcarbonyls.[30,39] The CO group is easily disassociated from the adsorbed surface molybdenum components at a relatively low temperature (150170 °C).[54] Second, Si(CH3)3CpMo(CO)2(?3-2-methylallyl), a molybdenum carbonyl precursor with a similar structure as C7H8Mo(CO)3, has been demonstrated for MoO3 deposition by ALD at a reaction temperature of 250  °C.[46] In that reaction, carbonyl groups and ?3-2-methylallyl are released during the first half-reaction whilst the Si(CH3)3Cp is removed after O3 exposures, forming Mo(= O)2 bonds. This result may reflect that the carbonyl ligand is more easily released from the metal components than the cycloakene ligand during the first ALD half-reaction. Third, the bond between Mo and the cyclo-heptatriene group is stronger than between Mo and the carbonyl group. The disassociated energy of the molybdenum-cyclo-heptatriene bond is 251 kJ mol-1, which is higher than that of 152 kJ mol-1 for a molybdenum-carbonyl bond, indicating that the CO ligand is more easily released than cycloheptatriene.[47] This also explains why the ALD window for the reaction of C7H8Mo(CO)3 and H2S is higher than that of Mo(CO)6 and H2S.[42] Therefore, we hypothesize that the CO groups are pref-erentially released during the first half-reaction (chemisorption of the molybdenum complex), and the cycloheptatriene ligand is removed during the second half-reaction (H2S exposure). An in situ FT-IR study for the elucidation of the reaction mecha-nism will be carried out in a follow-up study.The broad, multi-component S 2p core-level X-ray photo-emission spectra reflect that the as-deposited MoS2 films are of low quality and contain an amount of amorphous species (Figure 2b), which is further evidenced by Raman spectroscopy. There is no pronounced Raman peak of MoS2 observable in the as-deposited films (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which may suggest a low MoS2 film crystallinity or the predominant presence of amorphous MoS3, in line with the XPS results. Post-annealing at a relatively low temperature with H2S has been proven to be an efficient route to improve the crystallinity of the as-deposited ALD-chalcogenide films.[45,56] Therefore, an in situ post-annealing with H2S was carried out at 300 °C for 4 h to increase the crystallinity of the deposited films. Different from the as-deposited films, two characteristic Raman peaks at 406.7 and 380.6 cm-1, corresponding to the A1g and E2g1  peaks of MoS2, are observed in the sulfurized films, indicating improved crystallinity of the as-deposited MoS2 films after post-deposi-tion annealing (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The peak distance of ?26  cm-1 suggests that the film comprises more than six monolayers.[57] The same phenomenon was observed in the film deposited on sapphire substrates (Figure S6, Sup-porting Information). Noticeably, an experiment in which H2S was replaced with an inert gas (N2) shows that the H2S atmos-phere is critical to conducting the conversion reaction to pure MoS2 and improving the crystallinity of the films at the mild temperature sulfurization (Figure S7, Supporting Information).The sulfurized film was also characterized by XPS to fur-ther understand the influence of the in situ post-deposition annealing process. Compared to the as-deposited film, only Adv. Mater.

Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbHone sharp doublet of Mo 3d at 229.2 eV can be observed in the annealed film, which is ascribed to Mo4+ in MoS2, in agreement with the literature.[26] The disappearance of Mo6+ components at higher binding energies suggests that all Mo was fully con-verted to Mo4+ in MoS2 by post sulfurization (Figure 3c). The same trend is observed in the S 2p spectrum. In contrast to the broad S 2p spectrum in the as-deposited films, here, the pro-nounced doublet peak at 162.0 eV (S 2p3/2) and 163.2 eV (S 2p1/2) corresponds to the plane S2- in MoS2 (Figure  3d). The ?S22 /S0 peaks corresponding to amorphous MoS3 or unreacted sulfur are strongly reduced and can be entirely removed at higher annealing temperatures (Figure S8, Supporting Information).After optimizing the growth conditions on smooth and planar substrates, the growth of MoS2 onto nanostructured substrates with high aspect ratios was further investigated. A prototypical representative of these materials is carbon nanotubes (CNTs). To examine the morphology of the MoS2 film and the influ-ence of the post-annealing process, the MoS2 films deposited onto CNTs were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron dif-fraction (SAED). Although both CNTs are entirely coated with a smooth film, the SAED patterns suggest that the as-deposited MoS2 film is amorphous (Figure 3e), while the film after post-deposition sulfurization is polycrystalline (Figure 3f). Moreover, compared with the as-deposited amorphous films (light yellow mark in Figure  3e, right down), the sulfurized films exhibit clear lattice fringes associated with a d-spacing of 0.63  nm, which are assigned to the (002) planes of MoS2 (Figure  3f, right down). Consequently, all of the above results evidence the successful deposition of high conformal MoS2 by ALD at rela-tively low temperatures (<300 °C) using C7H8Mo(CO)3 and H2S as precursors, with an improved film purity and crystallinity obtained by the following in situ post-deposition sulfurization at 300  °C with H2S. Moreover, the successful development of this ALD process suggests that heteroleptic cycloalkenes metal carbonyl complexes can be considered as promising metal precursors for the ALD of metal chalcogenides.2.2. MoS2 Coated TiO2 Nanotubes for Photoelectrochemical ApplicationsOur novel ALD process has been applied to synthesize MoS2/TiO2 heterojunctions and elucidate their PEC performance. As discussed in the introduction, MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure constructed by combining TiO2 nanotubes and ALD-MoS2 is expected to be an efficient photoelectrode. Figure  4a sche-matically illustrates the archetypical fabrication process of ALD-MoS2/TiO2 nanotube array (denoted as MoS2/TiNTs) heterostructures constructed by depositing MoS2 onto TiO2 nanotube arrays (marked as TiNTs) with the established ALD process. Figure  4b,c shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) top view of the anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays before (Figure  4b) and after coating with 200 ALD cycles of MoS2 (Figure 4c). SEM cross-section images are shown in Figure S9  (Supporting Information). Both samples show similar mor-phology but significantly decreased pore diameters, with the average hole diameter decreasing from 62  nm for pristine TiNTs to 54  nm for MoS2/TiNTs (Figure S10, Supporting Information).The composition of the TiNTs substrates before and after ALD-MoS2 coating was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, shown in Figure 4d. For the pristine TiNTs sample, the intense Raman peak at ?144  cm-1 and three strong vibrational peaks Figure 3.

Advanced Materials Interfaces published by Wiley-VCH GmbHobserved at 394, 515, and 635 cm-1 can be assigned to E1g, B1g, A1g, and Eg vibration modes of anatase TiO2, respectively. Apart from the signal of anatase TiO2, the MoS2/TiNTs sample shows two characteristic Raman peaks of A1g and E2g1  vibration modes of MoS2 at ?408 and 382 cm-1, suggesting the successful depo-sition of ALD-MoS2 onto TiNTs. The morphology and structure of MoS2/TiNTs were further demonstrated by TEM. After ALD, the TiO2 nanotubes were homogeneously coated with MoS2 inside and outside (Figure  4e,f; Figure S11, Supporting Infor-mation). The clear lattice fringes of 0.63 and 0.35  nm reflect the (002) planes of MoS2 and the (101) planes of anatase TiO2 (Figure  4f), respectively. The SAED pattern of MoS2/TiNTs (Figure 4g) indicates that the TiO2 is polycrystalline. No obvious diffraction signal assigned to MoS2 can be observed from the pattern due to the low mass loading of MoS2 and strong dif-fraction of TiO2. However, strong S and Mo signals from MoS2 are observed on the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and the corresponding element maps, as shown in Figure 4h, further reveal a homoge-neous distribution of Mo and S elements throughout the inner and outer TiNTs wall.The PEC performance of the MoS2/TiNTs electrode was tested to prove the beneficial influence of the heterojunction. A LED visible-light source with 430  nm wavelength (energy lower than TiO2 bandgap) was applied for the PEC testing to ensure excitation of MoS2. The applied potential dependent photocurrent densities of the pristine TiNTs and MoS2/TiNTs (with 200 ALD cycles MoS2) heterostructure were recorded in the dark and under light irradiation (Figure S13, Sup-porting Information). The registered responses show that both electrodes excited under the 430 nm LED irradiation are stable in the whole potential range, and that the MoS2/TiNTs hetero-structure exhibits significantly enhanced PEC performance than the pure TiNTs. Figure 5a shows the chopped photocurrent density versus time curves of the pristine TiNTs and MoS2/TiNTs heterostructure with an external bias potential of 0.5 V. The MoS2/TiNTs heterostructure displays an improved photo-current density of ?30 µA cm-2, corresponding to an incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) of ?0.247%, which is three times higher than pristine TiNTs (photocurrent density of ?10 µA cm-2 and IPCE of ?0.082%). The significant improvement in the photocurrent density of the MoS2/TiNTs heterostructure could be attributed to the enhanced visible light-harvesting of MoS2 and further evidence the successful Figure 4. a) Schematic illustration of the fabrication process for the MoS2/TiNTs heterostructure.

Their PEC stabilities were further evaluated during 80  min long experi-ment (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Although MoS2/TiNTs electrode depicts some degradation in the first 40  min of the process, after that the efficiency stabilizes and photocur-rents of around 15  µA  cm-2 are maintained. Clearly, even in the long-time testing, the heterostructure generates more than twice times higher photocurrents than the pristine TiNTs.Furthermore, a strong correlation has been found between the PEC performance and the number of ALD cycles, ultimately the mass loading of the MoS2 (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Under the visible light (430  nm) illumination, the best PEC performance was obtained for the samples with 100 and 200 ALD cycles of MoS2, where the latter shows better stability. In contrast, the samples with either fewer ALD cycles of MoS2 (50 ALD cycles) or more ALD cycles (300 ALD cycles) are less stable/efficient. This reflects the optimal tradeoff between the thickness of the light-absorbing layer to collect all incident light and the distance for photo-generated charges to travel through the material (for details, see Supporting Information).In the next PEC experiment, a UV light source (LED 365 nm) was used to test the photoanodes properties (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The excitation energy is high enough to excite titanium dioxide (?3.2  eV for anatase).[58] As shown in Figure S16 (Supporting Information), the presence of MoS2 also positively influences PEC light conversion in the UV range. However, the highest performance (1.12
