A wideALD temperature window was observed from 100 to 400 C, where deposition rate was constant at0.53 A?/cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy survey scans indicated the presence of gallium,oxygen, and carbon elements with concentrations of 36, 51.8, and 12.2 at. %, respectively. As-deposited films were amorphous; upon annealing at 900 C under N2 atmosphere for 30 min,polycrystalline b-Ga2O3 phase with a monoclinic crystal structure was obtained.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1116/1.4758782]I. INTRODUCTIONGallium oxide (Ga2O3) is a wide band gap material withgood thermal and chemical stability, high dielectric constant,and large band gap (4.9 eV).1,2 Combination of these prop-erties enables Ga2O3 thin films to be used in various applica-tions, including solar cells,3 gas sensors,4 deep-UVphotodetectors,5 field-effect transistors,6 and spintronics.7The growth of Ga2O3 films has been accomplished by tech-niques, such as magnetron sputtering,8 electron beam evapo-ration,9 pulsed laser deposition,10 molecular beam epitaxy,11metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),12vapor phase epitaxy,13 and sol-gel process.14Several studies have been reported for the atomic layer dep-osition (ALD) of Ga2O3 thin films using different precursors.First report on the plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) of Ga2O3using oxygen (O2) plasma was published by Shan et al.3 Theirstudy, in which [(CH3)2GaNH2]3 was used as the gallium (Ga)precursor, presented the structural, electrical, and optical prop-erties of the deposited films.15,16 Ga2O3 and mixed Ga2O3-TiO2films have also been grown by PEALD using [(CH3)2GaNH2]3and Ti(NMe2)4 precursors in order to obtain films with largedielectric constant and low leakage current for electronic deviceapplications.1,17,18 Another study is about the fabrication ofmetal/insulator/semiconductor capacitors by using Ga2O3 as theinsulating layer.19 Ga precursor used in this study was not men-tioned by the authors. Besides PEALD, few studies regardingthe growth of Ga2O3 films using thermal ALD were reported aswell. Dezelah et al.20 employed Ga2(NMe2)6 together withH2O to obtain Ga2O3 thin films. This process exhibited anALD window between 170 and 250 C with a growth rate of1 A?/cycle. Recently, Lee et al.21 reported the deposition ofGa2O3 thin films via both ALD and MOCVD using a new Gaprecursor, dimethylgallium isopropoxide (Me2GaOiPr). A nar-row ALD window (280300 C) was reported for the process,and growth rate was found to be 0.28 A?/cycle in this region.In this study, we report on the growth of Ga2O3 thin filmsusing trimethylgallium (TMG) and O2 plasma as the Ga sourceand oxidant, respectively. To the best of our knowledge,PEALD of Ga2O3 films at such low temperatures using TMGhas not yet been reported. Chemical, structural, and morpholog-ical characterizations of the films are also presented.II. EXPERIMENTGa2O3 thin films were deposited by PEALD using TMG asthe Ga precursor and O2 plasma as the oxidant. Experimentswere carried out in a Fiji F200 ALD reactor (CambridgeNanotech) with a base pressure of 0.200.25 Torr. Solvent-cleaned Si (111) substrates were loaded into the reactorthrough a load lock. Ga2O3 films were then deposited on thesesubstrates at temperatures starting from room temperature to400 C. Ar was used as the carrier gas with the flow rates of60 and 200 sccm for TMG and O2, respectively. For the opti-mization of growth parameters, 150 cycles were deposited at250 C, where one cycle consisted of 0.015 s TMG (precursorbottle temperature 6 C)/5 s Ar purge/260 s (25 sccm,300 W) O2 plasma/5 s Ar purge. Postgrowth annealing ofGa2O3 films was performed in a rapid thermal annealing sys-tem (ATV-Unitem, RTP-1000-150) under 100 sccm N2 flow.Chemical compositions and bonding states of the Ga2O3thin films were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectros-copy (XPS), using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometerequipped with a monochromatic Al Ka x-ray source. Surfacemorphologies and root mean square (rms) roughnesses of thefilms were investigated by using an atomic force microscope(AFM, Asylum Research, MFP-3D) in the contact mode.Grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurementswere performed in a PANanalytical XPert PRO MRD dif-fractometer operating at 45 kV and 40 mA, using Cu Ka radi-ation (k¼ 0.15418 nm). Initial scans were performed withinthe range of 1090 by using 0.1 step size and 0.5 s countingtime. For the crystalline samples, additional data wereobtained within the same 2h range by the summation of eightscans, which were performed by using 0.1 step size and 10 scounting time. Ellipsometric spectra of the Ga2O3 thin filmsamples were measured at three angles of incidence (65, 70,and 75) within the wavelength range of 3001000 nm byspectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE, J. A. Woollam). Cauchydispersion function was used for modeling the opticala)Electronic mail: biyikli@unam.bilkent.edu.tr01A110-1 J. Vac. Sci. Technol.

Prior to depositions,native oxide thicknesses of the Si (111) substrates were meas-ured by spectroscopic ellipsometry, which were then used forestimating the thicknesses of deposited Ga2O3 layers usingthe Si/SiO2/Ga2O3 model.III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn order to optimize growth parameters needed for the self-limiting deposition of Ga2O3 thin films, effect of TMG dose,O2 plasma duration, and Ar purge time were studied. Dou-bling the TMG dose from 0.015 to 0.03 s (precursor bottletemperature 6 C) did not affect the deposition rate remark-ably, indicating that 0.015 s is high enough for surface satura-tion. Figure 1(a) shows the deposition rate of Ga2O3 films as afunction of O2 flow duration. Experiments were carried out byusing various durations ranging from 2 to 60 s. Depositionrate has saturated for O2 flow durations starting from 10 s.Although 10 s was acceptable, 20 s was used for the followingGa2O3 depositions. The effect of purge time on growth ratewas also investigated. Five seconds of Ar flow were found tobe sufficient for completely purging excess precursors andgaseous byproducts. In order to study the effect of tempera-ture on growth rate, 150 cycles with 0.015 s TMG and 20 s O2plasma were deposited at different temperatures (28400 C).A wide ALD temperature window was observed from 100 to400 C [Fig. 1(b)], where deposition rate was constant at0.53 A?/cycle. In Fig. 1(c), Ga2O3 film thicknesses were plot-ted as a function of the number of PEALD cycles. Films de-posited at 250 C exhibited a linear growth behavior. Slope ofthe linear fit corresponded to deposition rate observed withinthe ALD window.Chemical compositions and bonding states of the depos-ited Ga2O3 thin films were studied by XPS. Survey scansdetected peaks of Ga, oxygen (O), and carbon (C) with theconcentrations of 36, 51.8, and 12.2 at. %, respec-tively, for the film deposited at 250 C. Almost same elemen-tal compositions were measured for the films deposited atdifferent temperatures within the ALD window. The reasonof C found in the samples was asserted to be due to surfacecontamination. To prove this claim, bulk films were reachedby applying ion beam etching by using Ar ions with energyof 2 kV. C was not detected in the bulk films obtained byFIG. 1. Growth rate of Ga2O3 thin films as a function of (a) O2 plasma flowduration at 250 C, and (b) deposition temperature. TMG dose and O2plasma flow rate were constant at 0.015 s and 25 sccm, respectively. (c)Ga2O3 film thickness as a function of the number of PEALD cycles.FIG. 2.

Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 31, No. 1, Jan/Feb 201360 s etching. Ga 3d high resolution XPS spectrum takenfrom the surface of 26 nm thick Ga2O3 sample was fittedby using two subpeaks as shown in Fig. 2(a). Subpeak #1,with a binding energy of 21.2 eV, confirmed the presence ofGaO bond in the samples. Subpeak #2 (25 eV), on theother hand, was related to the contribution from O 2s corelevel.22 The effect of this contribution on XPS survey scanresults is also noteworthy, which leads to an overestimationof the Ga atomic concentration in deposited films. Figure2(b) is the O 1s high resolution XPS spectrum taken fromthe sample surface. Binding energy position of the O 1s(532.3 eV) core level was well consistent with theliterature.23Figure 3 shows the GIXRD patterns of as-deposited andannealed Ga2O3 films. Although these patterns belong to afilm deposited at 250 C, PEALD-grown Ga2O3 thin filmswere found to be amorphous in the as-deposited state irre-spective of their deposition temperature. Upon annealingat 900 C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere, polycrystallineb-Ga2O3 films with a monoclinic crystal structure wereobtained (ICDD reference code: 00-011-0370). Among allthe five different allotropic modifications of Ga2O3, b-Ga2O3is known to be the most stable and frequent one reported forthin films.24 In order to determine the annealing temperatureat which crystallization starts, as-deposited samples werealso annealed at 500, 600, 700, and 800 C for 30 min underN2 atmosphere. GIXRD patterns of these samples indicatedthat crystallization starts at 600 C. Crystallinity of theb-Ga2O3 films increased with annealing temperature.AFM analyses were performed for revealing the surfacemorphologies and measuring the rms roughnesses of26 nm thick Ga2O3 thin films deposited on Si (111) sub-strates. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show 3D AFM topographies ofthe as-deposited and annealed samples, respectively. rmsroughness value, which was measured from a 1 lm 1 lmscan area, increased from 0.16 to 0.37 nm after annealing at900 C for 30 min. Increase in the rms roughness value afterannealing was attributed to the formation of grains uponcrystallization.Thicknesses and optical constants of Ga2O3 thin filmswere estimated by modeling the spectra measured by spec-troscopic ellipsometry within the wavelength range of 3001000 nm. Ellipsometric spectra of the as-deposited andannealed Ga2O3 thin films (500 PEALD cycles) were mod-eled by the Cauchy dispersion function using Si (0.5 mm)/SiO2 (1.83 nm)/Ga2O3 layer structure. The thickness of theas-deposited film was measured as 26.2 nm, which did notchange remarkably after postgrowth annealing. Refractiveindex values, on the other hand, increased from 2.051.86 to2.091.92 for 3001000 nm spectral range (Fig. 5). Theseresults again indicate structural enhancement upon annealingat 900 C.FIG. 3. GIXRD patterns of as-deposited and annealed 26 nm thick Ga2O3thin films.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSGa2O3 thin films were deposited via PEALD at tempera-tures starting from room temperature using TMG and O2plasma. A wide ALD window ranging from 100 to 400 Cwas observed with a constant deposition rate of 0.53 A?/cycle. XPS studies confirmed the presence of Ga2O3, and Cdetected in the survey scans was attributed to surface con-tamination. Although as-deposited films were amorphous,annealing at 900 C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere resultedin crystallization. Upon postgrowth annealing, polycrystal-line b-Ga2O3 thin films with monoclinic structure wereobtained, which also exhibited higher refractive indices andrms roughnesses when compared to their as-depositedcounterparts.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was performed at UNAM supported by theState Planning Organization (DPT) of Turkey through theNational Nanotechnology Research Centre Project.
