Three heteroleptic Zr precursors were studied for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZrO2. Films were deposited from Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr), Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), and Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) with either t i water or ozone as the oxygen source { BuDAD = N,N-bis(tertbutyl)ethene-1,2-diaminato, TMEA = t tris[2-(methylamino)ethyl]aminate, TEA = triethoanolaminate}. Self-limiting /uniFB01 lm growth was con/uniFB01 rmed for the Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr)/O3 t i process at 250 °C and for the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process at 375 °C, which is among the highest temperatures for advanced heteroleptic precursors. Excellent /uniFB01 lm purity with C, H, and N levels below the detection limit of the elastic recoil detection analysis was obtained with ozone as the oxygen source. All the studied processes showed the same trend that at low deposition temperatures /uniFB01 lms were tetragonal ZrO2 and at higher temperatures mixtures of tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2. With water, the monoclinic phase appeared at higher temperatures than with ozone. In addition to the deposition temperature, the /uniFB01 lm thickness affected the phase; thinner /uniFB01 lms favored the tetragonal phase and monoclinic peaks were more clearly seen in thicker /uniFB01 lms. The high thermal stability and excellent /uniFB01 lm purity show that from the three studied Zr precursors, Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) is a noteworthy precursor candidate for ALD of ZrO2.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Zirconium dioxide is a very interesting material as an dielectric for micro-electronics, and it has been studied extensively particularly for memory applications. 1,2 Other applications include electrolytes and interlayers for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), 3,4 and lately ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms have also been studied for antibacterial purposes. 5 Zirconium dioxide has a bandgap of 5.8 eV, and a suitable band offset of 1.4 eV to Si. 6 The relative permittivity of ZrO 2 in the bulk form is between 20 (monoclinic ZrO2) and 47 (tetragonal ZrO2). The monoclinic phase is stable at room temperature and the change from the monoclinic phase to the most desired high permittivity tetragonal phase occurs above 1100 °C. 7 However, in thin /uniFB01 lms, tetragonal, cubic, and orthorhombic ZrO2 have been identi /uniFB01 ed. 8 10 -The effect of the surface energy is enhanced in thin /uniFB01 lms, making the appearance of high pressure and temperature phases possible.

Heteroleptic precursors, i.e., precursors with more than one type of ligands in the metal complex, have been widely studied for Zr. Possible bene /uniFB01 ts include better thermal stability, volatility, and reactivity compared to the homoleptic counterparts. 18 However, it is not always easy to predict the properties of the heteroleptic compounds and sometimes the result can be a combination of the undesirable properties of the ligands. Thus, it is important to study different heteroleptic compounds to understand the bene /uniFB01 ts they can offer compared to the traditional ALD precursors.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the method of choice to produce highly conformal and uniform thin /uniFB01 lms, especially for the microelectronic applications. 11 The /uniFB01 rst ZrO2 process for ALD was ZrCl4/H2O. 12 -15 Since then, various Zr precursors have been studied extensively, including amidinates, β -diketonates, and alkylamides. 9,16,17 Unfortunately, all these have drawbacks regarding either growth rate or thermal stability.

Advanced heteroleptic zirconium precursors applied in ALD most often have cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ring as one of the ligands. Cyclopentadienyls are good electron donors and form stable bonds with metals, which ensure good thermal stability of the compounds. 19 Also, the properties of the Cp ligands can easily be tuned by varying the number and composition of the substitutes on the ring. Examples of heteroleptic precursors with Cp ligands are RCpZr(NMe2)3 (R = H, ethyl or methyl), 20 RCp2ZrMe2 (R = H or methyl), 21 and MeCpZrCHT (CHT = cycloheptatrienyl). 22 Many of the heteroleptic precursors have been reported to exhibit selflimiting growth at 300 °C, including the CpZr(NMe2)3 that is widely used in industry. 23 RCp2ZrMe2 has a higher thermal stability of 350 °C but the as-deposited /uniFB01 lms consist of the low permittivity monoclinic ZrO2.

In this work, three heteroleptic zirconium precursors were studied as Zr sources in the atomic layer deposition of ZrO2. These compounds were cyclopentadienyl N,N-bis(tertbutyl) ethene-1,2-diaminato isopropylalkoxo zirconium Zr(Cp)

( BuDAD)(O Pr), methylcyclopentadienyl tris[2-(methylamino) t i ethyl]aminate zirconium Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl triethoanolaminate zirconium Zr(Me5Cp) (TEA) (Fig. 1). All three precursors have a Cp ring as one of the ligands but the number of substituents in the ring varies. t BuDAD, TMEA, and TEA ligands were used to attain better thermal stability compared to the state-of-the-art heteroleptic precursors and at the same time to retain reasonable volatility for the precursors.

## II. EXPERIMENT

## A. Precursor characterization

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs) and precursor vapor pressure studies were carried out in a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 1 STARe System. Measurements were done under nitrogen atmosphere with a nitrogen /uniFB02 ow of 220 sccm/min at atmospheric pressure. Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) was also studied under vacuum with a pressure of 20 Torr. A heating program of 10 °C/min was used in all the measurements. Vapor pressures were estimated by using evaporation rate at each temperature.

## B. Film deposition

Films were deposited in a hot-wall cross/uniFB02 ow F-120 ALD reactor (ASM Microchemistry) from Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr), t i Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), and Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor (all from Air Liquide) with either water or ozone as the oxygen source. The Zr precursors were solid at room temperature, but Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr) t i and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) melted in the reactor at their source temperature. The evaporation temperatures for the precursors were 65 °C for Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O i t Pr), 115 °C for Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA), and 120 °C for Zr(MeCp)(TMEA). The deposition temperatures were varied in the range of 200 -425 °C. The reactor pressure was ∼ 5 mbar. Water was kept in a container at room temperature outside the reactor and the vapor /uniFB02 ow was controlled by a needle valve. Ozone with a concentration of 100 g/m 3 was generated from O2 (AGA 99.999%) in an ozone generator (Wedeco Modular 4 HC). Nitrogen (AGA 99.999% H2O ≤ 3 ppm, O2 ≤ 3 ppm) was used as the carrier and purging gas. Si(100) wafers cut to 5 × 5 cm 2 pieces were used as substrates. Native oxide was not removed prior to deposition. For electrical measurements, /uniFB01 lms were deposited on Pt substrates.

## C. Film characterization

Film thicknesses were measured with x-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity using a Rigaku SmartLab x-ray diffractometer. Film densities were obtained by /uniFB01 tting the XRR data. Crystallinity and phase of the /uniFB01 lms were determined by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with a PANalytical X´Pert Pro MPD diffractometer.

TEM specimens were prepared with the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out method, with an FEI Quanta 3D 200i DualBeam instrument. Bright/uniFB01 eld TEM images were collected with a 200 kV Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope.

Film compositions were examined with time-of/uniFB02 ight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) at a detection angle of 40° by 40 MeV 79 Br 7+ ions obtained from a 5 MV tandem accelerator EGP-10-II.

For the electrical measurements, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) plate capacitors with Pt/ZrO2/Al structures were made. ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms were deposited on Pt evaporated on Si wafer. Aluminum dots with an area of 0.204 mm 2 were e-beam evaporated through a shadow mask on the top of the ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms. The dot diameter used for calculating the area was obtained from SEM images. The Pt electrode thickness was 40 nm, and the Al dot thicknesses were approximately 90 nm. There were vacuum breaks between all depositions. Current -voltage (I -V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter with a step size of 0.2 V/step. The capacitance values were measured with a HP4284A LCR meter with a frequency of 10 kHz. Relative permittivities were calculated from the mean capacitances.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## A. Precursor properties

The TG curves of the three precursors are depicted in Fig. 2(a). Zr(Cp)(tBuDAD)(OiPr) and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) showed a single step weight loss in atmospheric pressure. The residue for the Zr(Cp)(tBuDAD)(OiPr) precursor was very low, below 2%, indicating evaporation without decomposition. For the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) precursor, the residue was around 15% which means that the precursor is also decomposing.

Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) showed a two-step weight loss process with a residue of 65% after the /uniFB01 rst step and 30% at the end of the measurement (500 °C) at atmospheric pressure. Because of the high residues, also a measurement under vacuum was conducted. The results in vacuum were clearly better than in atmospheric pressure as the residue after the /uniFB01 rst step at 230 °C was 15%. Despite the decomposition seen in the TG analysis, in the ALD experiments, the /uniFB01 rst signs of precursor decomposition were seen only at 400 °C. Differences in the decomposition temperature between TG analysis and ALD deposition

experiments have previously been reported, for example, in ALD of CoO from CoCl2(TMEDA) (TMEDA= N N N , , 0 , N 0 -tetramethylethylenediamine) 24 and the probable cause for this comes from the differences in interactions in the gas phase and on the surface during the ALD process as compared to the interactions in the condensed phase in TG.

Vapor pressure studies of the precursors were in line with the TG results and showed that Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr) t i is substantially more volatile than the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) and Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursors [Fig. 2(b)]. Based on the vapor pressure, the evaporation temperatures for the ALD experiments were chosen to be 65 °C for Zr(Cp)( BuDAD) (O Pr) t i and 120 °C for Zr(MeCp)(TMEA). Sublimation temperature of 115 °C was chosen for the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor.

## B. Film deposition

The reactivities of the Zr precursors especially toward water varied largely [Fig. 3(a)]. Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) did not react with water below 400 °C and at 400 °C, the growth rate was very low, 0.1 Å/cycle.

With the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/H2O process, /uniFB01 lms were deposited at 200 -375 °C. Almost constant growth rate around

0.3 Å/cycle was obtained at 250 -350 °C. Slight increase in the growth rate was observed at 375 °C. With the Zr(Cp) ( BuDAD)(O i t Pr)/H2O process, /uniFB01 lms were deposited at 250 -425 °C. A temperature range with a constant growth rate of around 0.65 Å/cycle was seen from 325 to 400 °C [Fig. 3(a)].

All three precursors had higher growth rates with ozone than with water [Fig. 3(b)]. Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 had a constant growth rate of 0.4 Å/cycle at 350 -400 °C. The growth rate slightly increased at 425 °C because of the precursor decomposition. This decomposition was clearly observed from the appearance of some /uniFB01 lm deposits in the hot end of the source tube and it was not visible at lower deposition temperatures. The rather slow growth rates with Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) are probably caused by the bulky ligands that shield the Zr atoms and prevent reactions. TEA is also a chelating ligand with three oxygen donor atoms that are expected to bond stronger to Zr than the nitrogen donors in TMEA and BuDAD [Zr O bond strength is t -∼ 760 kJ/mol and

Zr-N ∼ 560 kJ/mol (Ref. 25)]. The advantage of the Zr(Me5Cp) (TEA) precursor is its excellent thermal stability compared to the other two precursors.

With the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/O3 process, the growth rate decreased with increasing temperature from 0.65 Å/cycle at 200 °C to 0.50 Å/cycle at 375 °C. Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr) t i with O3 showed the opposite behavior as the growth rates increased from 0.40 Å/cycle at 250 °C to 1.3 Å/cycle at 375 °C.

The deposition temperature affected the /uniFB01 lm density as depicted in Fig. 4. The bulk density of ZrO2 is around 6 g/cm 3 depending on the phase. With Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) and Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr), a considerable increase in the density t i was seen with increasing deposition temperature regardless of the oxygen source. With water, the /uniFB01 lm densities ranged from 5.7 to 5.9 g/cm 3 at the highest deposition temperatures, whereas at 250 °C the density decreased to 4.4 g/cm 3 for Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) (3.8 g/cm 3 at 200 °C) and 4.7 g/cm 3 for Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr) [Fig. 4(a)]. With ozone, slightly higher t i densities compared to water processes were observed at 250 °C. Because of the changes in the /uniFB01 lm density, the amount of material deposited, for example, in the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) processes is much higher at 350 °C (1.47 and 0.79 Zr atoms/ nm 2 cycle with O3 and H2O) and 375 °C (1.47 and 0.93 Zr atoms/nm 2 ⋅ cycle with O3 and H2O) compared to 250 °C (1.30 and 0.55 Zr atoms/nm 2 cycle with O3 and H2O) even though the growth rates are close to each other. Likewise, taking the density increase into account, the increase of the growth rate with increasing temperature in the Zr(Cp) ( BuDAD)(O i t Pr)/O3 process gets even stronger: 1.0 Zr atoms/nm 2 cycle at 250 °C, 1.8 Zr atoms/nm 2 ⋅ cycle at 300 °C, and 3.9 atoms/nm 2 ⋅ cycle at 375 °C.

Films deposited with Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) and ozone showed only a small decrease in density from 5.9 to 5.4 g/cm 3 while decreasing the deposition temperature [Fig. 4(b)]. The thickness of the /uniFB01 lms did not affect the density: /uniFB01 lms with thicknesses around 10 nm showed densities similar to 40 nm thick /uniFB01 lms at 300 -375 °C. With water, density was very low (4.7 g/cm ) 3 compared to the ozone process despite the high deposition temperatures of 400 and 425 °C [Fig. 4(a)]. The /uniFB01 lm thicknesses were similar in both processes. The low density appears to be due to the low reactivity of the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor with water which is seen in the low growth rate [Fig. 3(a)] and high impurity concentrations (Table I) in the /uniFB01 lms. Because of the low densities and very low growth rates, only a few /uniFB01 lms with the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/ H2O process were deposited.

The effect of the Zr precursor pulse length on the growth rate was studied to reveal the true, self-limiting ALD-type growth processes. Self-limiting growth mode was con /uniFB01 rmed for the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process at 300, 350 (not shown), and 375 °C (Fig. 5). The growth rate was 0.3 Å/cycle at 300 °C and 0.4 Å/cycle at 350 and 375 °C. At 400 °C, the growth rate increased slightly with increasing pulse length from 0.38 Å/ cycle at 1.0 s pulse length to 0.46 Å/cycle at 3.5 s Zr precursor pulse. This result demonstrates that the thermal stability of the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor is one of the highest among zirconium precursors and clearly higher than the thermal stability of the industrially dominant CpZr(NMe2)3 precursor which saturates at 300 °C. 20 Despite the very strong temperature dependence, self-limiting growth was also observed in the Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr)/O3 t i process at 250 °C (0.5 Å/cycle) but not at higher deposition temperatures. However, at this low deposition temperature, the /uniFB01 lm density was somewhat lower than the bulk value of ZrO2. Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) did not show saturation of the growth with ozone and none of the Zr precursors saturated when water was used as the oxygen source. The saturation studies for the ozone processes are shown in Fig. 5.

## C. Film characterization

All the three studied precursors showed similar trends regarding /uniFB01 lm crystallinity: The /uniFB01 lms were crystalline ZrO2, and the phase was either tetragonal ZrO2 (ICDD 50-1089) or a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic (ICDD 37-1484) ZrO2 depending on the growth temperature and oxygen source. At low deposition temperatures, only tetragonal phase was seen. With water, the temperature at which the monoclinic phase appeared was higher than with ozone. The

/uniFB01 rst small peaks from the monoclinic phase were visible at 300 °C with all Zr precursors when ozone was used as the oxygen source. With water, monoclinic peaks were /uniFB01 rst seen at 400 °C with the Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr) t i and at 350 °C with the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) precursor, whereas only tetragonal phase was seen with the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor (at 400 and 425 °C). The intensity of the monoclinic peaks increased with increasing temperature. The effect of the deposition temperature on the crystalline phase of the /uniFB01 lms is exempli /uniFB01 ed in Fig. 6 by Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/H2O processes.

## Zr(Mes Cp)(TEA)IO3

In addition to the deposition temperature, the /uniFB01 lm thickness affected the phase composition. It has been reported before that in ALD of ZrO2 very thin /uniFB01 lms favor the tetragonal phase and with increasing /uniFB01 lm thickness the intensity of the monoclinic peaks increases. 26 The stabilization of the tetragonal phase in thin /uniFB01 lms has been attributed to the lower

surface-free energy of the tetragonal phase compared to the monoclinic phase, which is more prominent in nanometer size. 27 With all three Zr precursors, thicker /uniFB01 lms could be deposited with water than with ozone without the monoclinic phase visible in the diffractograms. For example, /uniFB01 lms with thicknesses between 9 and 70 nm deposited with Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr)/H2O t i at 375 °C were all tetragonal ZrO2 [Fig. 7(a)]. With the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/H2O process at 350 °C, the /uniFB01 rst small monoclinic peaks were seen with a /uniFB01 lm thickness of 50 nm. With ozone, only very thin /uniFB01 lms were tetragonal: with the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) at 350 °C, only the tetragonal phase was detected for a 4 nm thick /uniFB01 lm, but monoclinic peaks were visible in a 9 nm thick /uniFB01 lm. For Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process at 300 °C, 12 nm thick /uniFB01 lm was tetragonal ZrO2 but monoclinic peaks could be seen in a 29 nm thick /uniFB01 lm [Fig. 7(b)]. At 375 °C, a small peak

assigned to the monoclinic phase was visible already in the diffractogram of a 10 nm thick /uniFB01 lm meaning that the deposition temperature seems to have a stronger impact on the phase composition than the /uniFB01 lm thickness.

Impurities and /uniFB01 lm compositions were studied with TOF-ERDA. The results are collected in Table I. In general, the /uniFB01 lms deposited with ozone had lower impurity contents than the /uniFB01 lms deposited with water. This kind of trend has been seen previously in oxide ALD depositions. 10 The high purity is attributed to the more ef /uniFB01 cient removal of the ligands by combustion with ozone than by hydrolysis reactions with water. 28 Exceptionally pure /uniFB01 lms were obtained with the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process at 300 375 °C -where the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content were below or slightly over the detection limit of TOF-ERDA. In this precursor, Zr is already attached to three oxygen atoms which may explain the high purity. The /uniFB01 lms deposited with Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), which did not show saturation of the growth rate (Fig. 5), had higher impurity levels than the others, especially at low deposition temperatures where the hydrogen levels with both water and ozone were considerable.

Capacitor structures were constructed to compare the electrical properties of the different ZrO2 processes. ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms

for the capacitors were deposited at 300 °C with all processes. For Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process, also capacitors with ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms deposited at 350 and 375 °C were studied. TEM images of the stack structure are depicted in Fig. 8. Relative permittivities ε r of the /uniFB01 lms were calculated from the capacitances using the equation for a parallel plate capacitor [Eq. (1)]:

$$C = \varepsilon _ { 0 } \varepsilon _ { r } \frac { A } { d }, & & ( 1 ) & & \text{phase} \\ & & \text{lower} \\ & & \text{for } c$$

where C is the capacitance, ε 0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, A is the area of the capacitor, and d is the thickness of the ZrO2 layer.

The permittivity values for the ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms deposited at 300 °C with different deposition processes ranged from 23 to 29. The highest permittivity was calculated for the /uniFB01 lm deposited with the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3. TEM image showed that the lateral grain size in this /uniFB01 lm is 20 -30 nm [Fig. 8(b)]. The permittivities for the other processes remained clearly lower, being 23 or 24 (Table II). The

permittivities of the /uniFB01 lms deposited at 350 and 375 °C with the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process were lower than at 300 °C, probably because of the increasing amount of monoclinic phase in the /uniFB01 lms. The dielectric loss values were 0.01 or lower in all the samples. Permittivity values reported before for cubic/tetragonal ZrO2 range from 20 to 40. 29 31 -However, comparison between the studies is often dif /uniFB01 cult because of the differences in /uniFB01 lm thicknesses, electrodes, thermal treatment, and preparation of the capacitors (i.e., vacuum breaks, use of clean room, etc.).

The leakage current density -electric /uniFB01 eld curves are shown in Fig. 9 for the /uniFB01 lms deposited at 300 °C by the three processes using ozone as the oxygen source. When the electrons were injected from the bottom electrode (positive electric /uniFB01 eld), the /uniFB01 lm deposited with the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/O3 process had clearly higher leakage current density compared

to the other processes whereas from the opposite direction, there is no difference. The higher leakage current could be caused by hydrogen impurities or lower quality of the /uniFB01 lm/ bottom electrode interface compared to the other processes. In the case of Zr(Cp)( BuDAD)(O Pr), t i clearly higher leakage current densities were obtained with water than with ozone as the oxygen source. The higher impurity content (especially carbon) and lower density of the /uniFB01 lms deposited with water compared to ozone are a likely cause for the higher leakage current density. With Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), the values were in the same range with both oxygen sources. With the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 process, leakage current densities were in the order of 10 -8 A/cm 2 at 1 MV/cm. Very low leakage current of 2 ⋅ 10 -8 A/cm 2 was also measured for the Zr(Cp) ( BuDAD)(O Pr)/O3 t i process, whereas with Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), the leakage current densities were in the order of 10 -7 and 10 -6 A/cm 2 for both water and ozone deposited /uniFB01 lms. Leakage current densities for the different capacitors measured at 1 MV/cm are shown in Table II.

## IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Three heteroleptic Zr precursors, Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA), Zr(Cp) ( BuDAD)(O i t Pr), and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), were studied for the ALD of ZrO2 using water or ozone as the oxygen source. The growth rates, crystal phases, impurity contents, and electrical properties were evaluated. Excellent /uniFB01 lm purity was achieved with all the Zr precursors with ozone and especially with the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor where pure ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms were deposited with impurity levels below or at the detection limit (0.1 at. %) of TOF-ERDA. With water, higher impurity levels were detected compared to ozone, but water favored the formation of the highκ tetragonal ZrO2 phase. With ozone, most /uniFB01 lms were mixtures of tetragonal and monoclinic phases with the monoclinic peak intensity increasing with increasing deposition temperature. The best precursor was found to be Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) with excellent thermal stability; self-limiting growth was achieved at as high as 375 °C with a growth rate of 0.4 Å/cycle. These /uniFB01 lms also had low leakage current densities in the order of 10 -8 A/cm 2 at 1 MV/cm. Key features of the processes are collected in Table III and compared with selected processes from the literature.
