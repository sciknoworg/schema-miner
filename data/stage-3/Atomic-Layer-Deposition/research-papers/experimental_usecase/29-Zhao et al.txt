Thermal and Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition of YttriumOxide Films and the Properties of Water WettabilityBo Zhao, Felix Mattelaer, Geert Rampelberg, Jolien Dendooven, and Christophe Detavernier*Department of Solid State Sciences, Ghent University, Krijgslaan 281 S12, 9000 Ghent, Belgium*S Supporting InformationABSTRACT: The atomic layer deposition (ALD) of yttrium oxide (Y2O3) is investigated using the liquid precursorY(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) as the yttrium source with thermal (H2O) and plasma-enhanced (H2O plasma and O2 plasma) processes,respectively. Saturation is con?rmed for the growth of the Y2O3 ?lms with each investigated reactant with a similar ALD windowfrom 150 to 300 °C, albeit with a di?erent growth rate. All of the as-deposited Y2O3 ?lms are pure and smooth and have apolycrystalline cubic structure. The as-deposited Y2O3 ?lms are hydrophobic with water contact angles >90°. The water contactangle gradually increased and the surface free energy gradually decreased as the ?lm thickness increased, reaching a saturatedvalue at a Y2O3 ?lm thickness of ?20 nm. The hydrophobicity was retained during post-ALD annealed at 500 °C in static air for2 h. Exposure to polar and nonpolar solvents in?uences the Y2O3 water contact angle. The reported ALD process for Y2O3 ?lmsmay ?nd potential applications in the ?eld of hydrophobic coatings.KEYWORDS: atomic layer deposition, plasma-enhanced, heteroleptic precursor, yttrium oxide, water contact angle1. INTRODUCTIONYttrium oxide (Y2O3) o?ers material properties that areattractive to speci?c applications. Its high refractive index of1.9 is useful for the fabrication of planar waveguides in solid-state and high-power lasers.1 Bulk Y2O3 has a high thermalconductivity of 0.27 W (cm K)?1 at 300 K, a high meltingpoint of 2430 °C, and a high mechanical strength, which makesit an interesting material for temperature- and wear-resistantcoatings.2?5 Y2O3 has numerous applications in the ?elds ofelectronics and optoelectronics.6?9 For example, thin ?lms ofY2O3 are suited as high-k gate dielectrics due to the largeintrinsic band gap in the range of 5.5 to 5.8 eV and the highdielectric constant of 14?18. For this reason, Y2O3 thin ?lmsare intensively studied in metal oxide semiconductor ?elde?ect transistors (MOSFETs) as the thin high-k gatematerial.10 Moreover, Y2O3 thin ?lms have been employed asoptical and protective coatings, bu?er layers in ferroelectricsand superconductors, as well as dielectric insulators inelectroluminescent devices.11?14 For example, the rare-earth-doped Y2O3 ?lms, such as Eu:Y2O3,15,16 Er:Y2O3,17Er:Eu:Y2O3,18 and Er:Yb:Y2O3,19 have been widely used inphotonic devices, like optical ampli?ers, sensors, up-converters,light-emitting diodes (LEDs), organic LEDs, and thin-?lmelectroluminescent devices. In addition, Y2O3-based ?lms, suchas yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and yttria-doped ceria(YDC), are applied as solid-state electrolytes for solid oxidefuel cells (SOFCs).20?25There have been a variety of methods used to deposit thin?lms of Y2O3, including physical vapor deposition (PVD),26chemical vapor deposition (CVD),27 plasma-enhanced chem-ical vapor deposition (PECVD),28 and atomic layer deposition(ALD). Studies such as these have shown that important ?lmproperties such as crystallinity, residual carbon content, andelectronic properties are in?uenced by the choice of depositionmethod as well as the particular precursor/reactant used.Among them, ALD has attracted much interest because it isable to produce high-quality, uniform, and conformal ?lmswith excellent composition and submonolayer thicknesscontrol, even at low growth temperatures based on self-limitedsurface reactions.29?31 During ALD, the ?lm grows throughReceived: October 10, 2019Accepted: December 20, 2019Published: December 20, 2019Research Articlewww.acsami.orgCite This: ACS Appl.

Thechoice of the proper metal precursor is crucial for a successfulALD process. The main requirements for ALD precursorsconcern a suitable vapor pressure at its supplying temperature,no self-decomposition at the process temperature, and anaggressive reaction with surface groups.32,33In prior research on the ALD of Y2O3, thermal or plasma-enhanced techniques with various types of precursors havebeen explored, as summarized in Table 2. Cyclopentadienyl-(Cp-) based precursors, Y(Cp)3,34 Y(MeCp)3,35 Y(EtCp)3,36and Y(iPrCp)3,37 are solid at room temperature (RT) andshow high growth rates and reactivity toward water, O2 plasma,or O3 but su?er from poor thermal stability. O-coordinated ?-diketonate Y(thd)338 is solid at RT and o?ers good thermalstability but requires sublimation over 130 °C while exhibitinga growth rate of only 0.23 Å per cycle at a high substratetemperature of 350 °C, and the deposited ?lm was reported tocontain carbon 1.4% impurities. To reduce the carbon level inthe ?lms, N-coordination and heteroleptic precursors havebeen evaluated, like Y(DPDMG)3,39 Y(iPr2-amd)3,40 andY(iPrCp)2(iPr-amd).41?43 Y(DPDMG)3 is solid at RT andrequires sublimation over 130 °C, and the deposited ?lm wasreported to contain 3 at % N and 2 at % C impurities. Y(iPr2-amd)3 is solid at RT, and growth resulted in a ?lm with a highO content (Y/O ratio of 0.5). Whereas solid precursors mayhave similar thermodynamic vapor pressures with liquidprecursors, they are still limited by the slower kinetics ofvaporization. Therefore, liquid precursors are preferred forALD processes. The heteroleptic Y(iPrCp)2(iPr-amd), whichconsists of cyclopentadienyl and amidinate ligands, is the onlyliquid precursor reported so far in the literature. TheY(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) discussed in this work is also liquid atRT and will be shown to enable a signi?cantly higher growthrate compared with Y(iPrCp)2(iPr-amd).Hydrophobic coatings are widely used in applicationsranging from industrial components to housewares.44,45Inorganic metal oxide hydrophobic coatings have attractedmore and more interest because of the better mechanicaldurability and thermal stability than traditional polymerhydrophobic coatings.46 ZnO47,48 and TiO249,50 are the mostresearched, but the hydrophobicity was not retained aftereither high-temperature annealing or UV exposure. Recently,rare-earth oxides were studied as hydrophobic materials.Varanasi et al.51 and Kim et al.52 reported that Er2O3,Dy2O3, La2O3, Y2O3, CeO2, Pr6O11, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3,Gd2O3, Tb4O7, Ho2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, and Lu2O3 ?lms showhigh hydrophobicity with water contact angles >90°. There-fore, it can be concluded that rare-earth oxides have potentialapplicability as robust hydrophobic surfaces.In this work, we report the ALD of Y2O3 ?lms from a liquidheteroleptic precursor, yttrium bis-ethylcyclopentadienyl-diiso-propylacetamidinate, Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd), for which thechemical structure is shown in Figure 1, with thermal (H2O)and plasma-enhanced (H2O plasma and O2 plasma) processes,respectively. The ALD process conditions that are required todeposit Y2O3 ?lms are investigated and optimized. Themorphology, conformality, crystallinity, and composition ofthe grown ?lms are characterized. Finally, we investigated thewater wettability of Y2O3 ?lms and the in?uence of exposure todi?erent solvents (hexane, toluene, ethanol and isopropanol)on their wetting properties.2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION2.1. ALD of Y2O3 Thin Films. The Y2O3 ?lms were grown on Si(100) substrates with a native oxide layer in a home-built high-vacuum ALD system with a base pressure <5 × 10?6 mbar.53?55 In theALD process, Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) (supplied by AirLiquide) was usedas the Y source. As reactant gases, water, oxygen plasma, and waterplasma were tested, respectively. The oxygen and water plasma pulsesof 1 × 10?2 mbar were performed with a radio frequency remoteplasma source of 13.56 MHz and a power of 200 W. The ALDchamber and walls were heated to 100 °C. The Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd)precursor was held in a stainless-steel container at 120 °C for optimalvapor pressure without decomposition, and the delivery line wasmaintained at 130 °C to avoid precursor condensation. Argon wasused as the carrier gas for Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) precursor delivery tothe ALD chamber. Water was kept at room temperature, and thedelivery line was heated to 50 °C.2.2. Characterization of Y2O3 Thin Films. X-ray re?ectometry(XRR) and X-ray di?raction (XRD) patterns were acquired on BrukerD8 di?ractometers using Cu K? radiation (? = 0.154 nm). The ?lmthickness and density were determined from XRR by ?tting simulatedpatterns to the measured ones. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)measurements were performed with a J. A. Woollam M-2000ellipsometer with a wavelength from 245 to 1000 nm and using theCompleteEASE software for ?tting and data analysis. Surfacemorphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM, Quanta 200F FEI) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) intapping mode by using a Bruker Dimension Edge system. X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on aThermo Scienti?c Theta Probe XPS instrument using Al K? (? =0.834 nm) X-rays generated at 15 kV and 70 W and focused to a spotsize of 0.3 mm by an MXR1 monochromator gun. The sample surfacewas etched by Ar+ ions at an acceleration voltage of 3 keV and acurrent of 2 ?A. After the measurements, the resulting spectra wereanalyzed with the CasaXPS software package for the calculation ofatomic concentrations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Vertex V70 Bruker) was used to detect surface chemical functionalgroups. The data were collected from 600 to 4000 cm?1 with aresolution of 4 cm?1.2.3. Water Contact-Angle Measurements. The water wett-ability of ALD Y2O3 ?lms was evaluated by the sessile drop techniqueusing a contact-angle analyzer (Kruss, DSA30) with deionized water.Contact-angle images were acquired by a charge-coupled device videocamera and Drop Shape Analysis software. The volume of eachdeionized water droplet used was 4 ?L. For the thermal stabilityexperiments, ALD Y2O3 ?lms were annealed in a furnace at 500 °C for2 h in the static air, after which the contact angle was measured. Weused a dipping method to simulate the e?ect of di?erent ambientconditions on the water wettability of Y2O3 ?lms.56 Hexane, toluene,ethanol, and isopropanol were investigated as the dipping solvents,respectively. A 2 cm × 2 cm piece of Si wafer was immersed in thesolvent for 24 h, taken out, and left to dry in the air naturally, afterwhich we measured the water contact angle. All of the contact-anglevalues in this work are reported as the average value recorded by theanalyzer system.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3.1. ALD of Y2O3 with Thermal (H2O) and Plasma-Enhanced (O2 Plasma and H2O Plasma) Process. In a trueFigure 1. Chemical structure of the Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) precursor.ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Research ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acsami.9b18412ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXXBALD process, the precursor surface reactions must be self-terminating and complementary to yield a uniform, conformal,and high-quality Y2O3 thin ?lm. To verify that the surfacereaction for Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) is really self-terminating, thee?ects of pulse time and substrate temperature wereinvestigated. Figure 2a shows the results by monitoring thegrowth per cycle (GPC) as a function of both Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) and H2O pulse times at a constant temperature of 200°C. The GPC for Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) is saturated when thepulse time exceeds 15 s. This result indicates thatY(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) undergoes a self-terminating reactionwith the Y2O3 surface prepared by the reaction with H2O.The H2O pulse time is saturated when it exceeds at 10 s. Thissuggests that H2O undergoes a self-terminating reaction withsurface-absorbed Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) molecules. The saturatedGPC is 0.74 Å/cycle. The plasma-enhanced process includesO2 plasma and H2O plasma, showing similar behaviorscharacteristic of a saturated reaction. For the O2 plasma case,saturation was achieved after Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) 12 s/O2plasma 8 s and yielded a slightly higher GPC of 0.83 Å/cycle (Figure 2b). For H2O plasma, saturation was achieved ata 1.03 Å/cycle of Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) 15 s/H2O plasma 8s(Figure 2c). To understand the deposition kinetics, thethickness was monitored as a function of the cycle numberunder the saturation conditions of Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) and thereactant at a constant temperature of 200 °C (Figure 2d). Forthe water thermal process, growth inhibition of ?15 cyclescould be observed, but after ?15 cycles, the ?lm thicknessincreased linearly as a function of the number of ALD cycles.The slope of the linear line is the GPC value, whichcorresponds to the GPC of the saturation time test (Figure2a). For the plasma process (O2 plasma and H2O plasma), nogrowth inhibition was observed, and the slopes were alsoconsistent with the GPC mentioned under the saturatedconditions (Figure 2b,c).As shown in Figure 3, all three reactants (H2O, O2 plasma,and H2O plasma) have the same type of temperature window,with a nearly constant GPC value between 150 and 300 °C. Inaddition, there is almost no growth when only Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) pulses without any reactant (gray dots), which indicatesthat the Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) precursor is stable and does notdecompose between 150 and 300 °C. Below 150 °C, the GPCdecreases slightly, whereas above 300 °C the GPC increasesabruptly with increasing substrate temperature. This suggeststhat the Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) precursor molecules are chem-isorbed with self-saturation on the surface at 150?300 °C,whereas an incomplete reaction occurs below 150 °C, andaccelerated decomposition occurs above 300 °C. So in themention of this work, we performed deposition at a substratetemperature of 200 °C.Figure 4 shows the representative AFM images andcorresponding XRR patterns. The resulting ?lms were acquiredafter 250 ALD cycles of Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) with H2O, O2plasma, and H2O plasma, respectively. For the AFM images,the scanned area is 3 × 3 ?m2. The surface morphologyappears homogeneous and exhibits relatively low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ?0.41 nm with H2O (Figure 4a),?0.73 nm with O2 plasma (Figure 4b), and ?0.64 nm withH2O plasma (Figure 4c). From XRR and ?tting results (Figure4d), the density of the ?lm is 4.88 g/cm3 with H2O as reactant,Figure 2.

Interfaces XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXXD4.97 g/cm3 with O2 plasma, and 4.92 g/cm3 with H2O plasma.These values are lower than the value of 5.03 g/cm3 reportedfor the bulk density of Y2O3, which is probably related to theinclusion of ?OH. The densities for the plasma-enhancedprocesses (O2 plasma and H2O plasma) are slightly higher thanthat of the thermal process. The thickness determined by XRRis similar to the results of SE, indicating that the Cauchy modelused for analyzing the in situ SE data is indeed suitable. Theroughness determined by XRR is also close to the results ofAFM. All results are summarized in Table 1.Conformality is an important aspect of ALD processdevelopment, as it is the ability to conformally deposit a ?lmon a substrate, especially for the 3D complex structures withideally no variation in thickness along with the structure.29,30Here the conformality of the coating was investigated bydepositing a 10 nm Y2O3 ?lm with H2O, O2 plasma, and H2Oplasma, respectively, on a high-aspect-ratio (AR) structureconsisting of silicon micropillars with an AR of 25 (namely, 2?m wide, 50 ?m high, spaced 4 ?m center-to-center on asquare lattice) etched into a silicon substrate, shown in Figure5. The as-deposited samples were measured with SEM andenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to evaluate theamounts of yttrium at di?erent depths (Figure 5d, inset). TheEDX spectra in Figure 5a show the Y2O3 coating fromY(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) with H2O and clearly demonstrate the Ypeak, indicating the presence of Y2O3. For the O2 plasma(Figure 5b) and H2O plasma (Figure 5c), the samples showthe same trend from top to bottom on the micropillars. Todistinguish the Si and Y signals, we ?tted the EDX spectra witha Gaussian equation (see the Supporting Information) to getthe Y peak area as a function of depth along the pillars. At thesecond marker on the cross-sectional SEM image (line 2),which is 17 ?m deep along the pillars, the peak area of Ymaintained ?94% of the initial value on line 1, and even at thebottom of the pillars, the Y peak area is still >85% of its initialvalue (Figure 5d). These results indicated that for the thermal(H2O) and plasma-enhanced (O2 plasma and H2O plasma)processes, the pillars are fully coated with a reasonableconformality, although the amounts are not perfectly constantas a function of the penetration depth.The crystalline structure of 30 nm Y2O3 ?lms on Sisubstrates was determined by XRD. All three investigatedreactants yield polycrystalline cubic Y2O3 (JCPDS 41-1105).38The corresponding lattice planes are labeled for the di?erentdi?ractions peaks in Figure 6. It demonstrates that the normaldirection of the (222) plane is the most obvious, whereas the(211), (400), (431), (440), and (622) planes of cubic Y2O3are also clearly observed.The chemical binding environments in as-deposited Y2O3?lms were studied by XPS, and the results are shown in Figure7. All of the data were collected after Ar+ beam sputtering 20 sfrom the surface to remove carbon surface contaminants.Figure 7a shows that all of the ?lms deposited using di?erentprocesses contain Y and O, whereas no N is detected,suggesting that the N-coordination from the Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) molecule was not retained in the ?lm. After sputtering,no C contamination in the bulk of the ?lms could be detected.As shown in the Y 3d core-level spectrum of the as-deposited?lms (Figure 7b), the peak at 157.6 eV can be assigned to Y3d5/2, and the shoulder peak at 159.6 eV is identi?ed as Y3d3/2. In Figure 7c, the peaks assigned to O 1s for the threereactants have some slight variations around 530.1 eV, possiblydue to the di?erent contents of Y?O and Y?OH.57 Theimpurity content of C is <0.5 at %, and the atomic ratio of Y/Ois 0.57 to 0.60 for the Y2O3 ?lms by the three processes,indicating the deposition of a high-purity Y2O3 ?lm.From the above characterizations, we know that the as-deposited Y2O3 ?lms are pure (with C and N impurity levelsbelow 0.5 at %) and smooth and have a polycrystalline cubicstructure. To make a comprehensive assessment of our results,we summarized existing literature on the ALD of Y2O3 usingdi?erent precursors in Table 2. The Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) usedin this research and Y(iPrCp)2(iPr-amd) are the only liquidprecursors reported so far. When compared with Y-(iPrCp)2(iPr-amd), the Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) explored in thiswork was demonstrated to o?er a signi?cantly higher growthrate as well as a wider temperature window. All otherprecursors listed in Table 2 are solids, require a high sourcetemperature, and su?er from a low GPC or from C/Nimpurities in the deposited ?lms.3.2. Water Wettability of Y2O3 Films. Figure 8 shows themeasured water contact angle values as a function of the Y2O3?lm thickness varying from 5 to 30 nm for the investigatedthree di?erent ALD processes. The water contact angle of theSi substrate with a native oxide layer is ?40° without ALDFigure 6. XRD patterns of Y2O3 ?lms for Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) withH2O, O2 plasma, and H2O plasma.Figure 7.

Mater. Interfaces XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXXEgrowth of Y2O3, showing the typically hydrophilic property.For the Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) with H2O process (Figure 8a), the20 and 30 nm Y2O3 ?lms yielded a water contact angle of?95°. The water contact angle reduced to 87° for 10 nm Y2O3ALD ?lms and even to 77° for 5 nm ?lms. A similar thicknessdependency was also observed for the other two reactants, O2plasma (Figure 8b) and H2O plasma (Figure 8c). Figure 8dshows the surface free energy calculated from the water contactangle of ALD Y2O3 ?lms with di?erent thicknesses by theYoung?Dupre ? equation58? ?= +W (1 cos )where W is the surface free energy (N/m), ? is the surfacetension of water, which is a constant of 0.072 J/m2, and ? is thewater contact angle. The three reactants show similar results.An inverse relationship between water contact angle values andthe surface free energy is observed with increasing thethickness of Y2O3. The thinner the ?lm, the smaller thewater contact angle and the higher the surface free energy,which is more easily wetted with water. All of the investigated?lms with a thickness >20 nm have a stable water contact angleTable 2.

Mater. Interfaces XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXXFof ?95°, which indicates that they are with a hydrophobicsurface. To obtain a stable water contact angle, the workdescribed later about the water wettability was performed using30 nm ?lms.To evaluate the e?ect of ALD post-annealing on thewettability of the Y2O3 surfaces, we annealed the ALD Y2O3?lms at 500 °C for 2 h in static air. As shown in Figure 9a, thewater contact angles of annealed ALD Y2O3 ?lms were slightlysmaller than those of as-deposited samples but still maintainedvalues around 80°, which indicates the quite robust behavior ofthe surfaces wettabilities.59 The exact nature and compositionof the surface are important factors for the materials waterwettability. Adsorbed molecules can have a signi?cant impacton the water contact angle.60?63 Therefore, we investigated thein?uence of four di?erent solvents (hexane, toluene, ethanol,and isopropanol) on the water contact angle of Y2O3 ?lms.After immersing Y2O3 ALD ?lms in these solvents for 24 h, thewater wettability was evaluated. Figure 9b demonstrates thatexposure of the Y2O3 surface to typical nonpolar solvents likehexane and toluene enhanced the hydrophobicity, as the watercontact angle increased to 104.8 and 102.3°, respectively,which is higher than the value of 95° measured for the as-deposited Y2O3. Exposure to polar solvents like ethanol andisopropanol induced a hydrophilic e?ect, decreasing the watercontact angle to 68 and 69.2°, respectively. The FT-IR data ofas-deposited Y2O3 and after exposure to hexane, toluene,ethanol, and isopropanol are shown in Figure S3.4. CONCLUSIONSWe have successfully fabricated ALD?Y2O3 ?lms using a liquidheteroleptic Y precursor, Y(EtCp)2(iPr-amd), and investigatedH2O, O2 plasma, and H2O plasma as reactants, respectively.The growth of the Y2O3 ?lms with each investigated reactantcan get saturated with a similar ALD window from 150 to 300°C but with a di?erent growth rate. All of the as-depositedY2O3 ?lms are pure and smooth and have a polycrystallinecubic structure. Compared with other Y precursors, Y-(EtCp)2(iPr-amd) is a liquid, requires a lower sourcetemperature (?120 °C), o?ers a wide temperature windowfor ALD (150 to 300 °C), and enables the deposition of high-purity ?lms (C/N impurities below 0.5 at %) at a high growthrate (0.74 to 1.03 Å/cycle), which renders it a promisingprecursor for industrial applications. The as-deposited Y2O3?lms are hydrophobic with a water contact angle of ?95°. Thehydrophobicity was retained during post-ALD annealing andcould be altered by exposure to various solvents.?
