Two approaches were taken; using pure oxygen insteadof air and using a noble metal starting surface instead of Al2O3. Platinum thin filmswere obtained by ALD from MeCpPtMe3 and pure oxygen at deposition temperatureas low as 200 °C, which is significantly lower than the low-temperature limit of300 °C previously reported for the platinum ALD process in which air was used as theoxygen source. The platinum films grown in this study had smooth surfaces, adheredwell to the substrate, and had low impurity contents. ALD of ruthenium, on the otherhand, took place at lower deposition temperatures on an iridium seed layer than on anAl2O3 layer. On iridium surface, ruthenium films were obtained from RuCp2 andoxygen at 225 °C and from Ru(thd)3 and oxygen at 250 °C, whereas no films wereobtained on Al2O3 at temperatures lower than 275 and 325 °C, respectively. Thecrystal orientation of the ruthenium films was found to depend on the precursor. ALDof palladium from a palladium -ketoiminate precursor and oxygen at 250 and 275 °Cwas also studied. However, the film-growth rate did not saturate to a constant levelwhen the precursor pulse times were increased.I. INTRODUCTIONNoble metals have many potential applications in in-tegrated circuits. Platinum, ruthenium, and iridium arepotential electrode materials in dynamic random accessmemories (DRAMs) and in ferroelectric random accessmemories (FRAMs).14 They are also potential gate elec-trode materials in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effecttransistors (MOSFETs).57 Furthermore, ruthenium andpalladium have been studied as barrier or seed materialsfor copper interconnects in the integrated circuits.810Deposition of noble metals by chemical vapor deposition(CVD) has extensively been studied.11 Atomic layerdeposition (ALD)12 is another promising method fornoble metal deposition for these applications because ofthe excellent conformality and good large-area unifor-mity13,14 of the deposited films.Low deposition temperatures have many benefits inthe above mentioned applications of noble metals.Smoother films are obtained at lower deposition tem-peratures because of less pronounced crystal growth.15,16Smooth bottom electrodes have been shown to providelower leakage currents in the memory capacitors.1,17 Inaddition, less aggressive process conditions (e.g., lowerdeposition temperature) may retard the barrier oxida-tion1 during the noble metal deposition. In interconnectmetallization, low deposition temperature is requiredwhen temperature-sensitive low-k dielectrics are used.14Furthermore, at lower deposition temperatures, noblemetal films with lower degree of crystallization are pro-duced,18 possibly reducing the grain-boundary diffusionof copper through the noble metal barrier, as is the casewith transition metal nitride barriers.19ALD processes for ruthenium,15,16,2022 platinum,23palladium,24 and iridium18 thin films have recently beenreported. The low-temperature limits for these processesare 270 °C for ruthenium, 300 °C for platinum, 225 °Cfor iridium, and 80 °C for palladium, the palladium filmsa)Address all correspondence to this author.e-mail: titta.aaltonen@helsinki.fiDOI: 10.1557/JMR.2004.0426J.

In addition, plasma assisted ALD of rutheniumhas been reported.22 In the oxygen-based processes, oxy-gen dissociatively adsorbs on the noble metal surfaceduring the oxygen pulse and oxidatively decomposes theligands of the metal precursor during the followingpulse.25 The noble metal surface thus catalytically acti-vates the film growth reactions. The onset of the filmgrowth, on the other hand, takes place on the initial sub-strate surface, which may not be catalytically active. Insuch case, the film growth may be prevented by lowreactivity of the metal precursor with the initial surface orby the lack of catalytic activation of oxygen. If the onsetof the film growth is the growth limiting factor, a cata-lytically active seed layer can be used to facilitate theonset of the film growth.In this paper, we have studied methods for loweringthe deposition temperature for ALD of ruthenium andplatinum films. Ruthenium films were grown at lowertemperatures than previously reported15,16 by using aniridium seed layer that was grown in the same ALDprocess at the same temperature as the ruthenium film.RuCp2 (Cp  cyclopentadienyl) and Ru(thd)3 (thd 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato) were used as ru-thenium precursors. We also report a low-temperatureALD process for platinum from MeCpPtMe3 and pureoxygen. In addition, we have studied palladium deposi-tion by a process based on oxidative decomposition ofPd(keim2)2 [keim2  CF3C(O)CH-C(CF3)NBun] attemperatures lower than 300 °C.II. EXPERIMENTALThe films were grown in a hot-wall flow-type F-120ALD reactor (ASM Microchemistry Ltd., Helsinki, Fin-land) operated under a pressure of about 10 mbar. Nitro-gen (99.9995%), from a NITROX UHPN 3000 nitrogengenerator (Schmidlin, Neuheim), was used as a carrierand a purging gas. The noble metal films were grown on5 cm × 5 cm borosilicate glass and silicon substrates withan as-deposited 24 nm thick, amorphous Al2O3 layer.The Al2O3 layer was grown by ALD from AlCl3 andH2O.26 Platinum films were grown by ALD fromMeCpPtMe3 (Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA) andoxygen (99.999%). MeCpPtMe3 was evaporated at roomtemperature inside the reactor. The oxygen flow ratewas 20 sccm. Palladium was deposited by ALD fromPd(keim2)2, whose structure is shown in Fig. 1, and oxy-gen (99.999%). The palladium precursor was synthesizedas described by Liu et al.27 Pd(keim2)2 was evaporated at60 °C, which is also the melting point of the compound.Oxygen flow rates of 20 and 40 sccm were used.Iridium films were grown from Ir(acac)3 (acac ace-tylacetonato) (Strem Chemicals), and ruthenium filmsfrom RuCp2 (Strem Chemicals) and Ru(thd)3 (Volatec,Porvoo, Finland) by similar ALD processes as describedearlier15,16,18 with the exception that oxygen (99.999%)instead of air was used as the other reagent. Oxygen flowrates of 5 and 20 sccm were used in the RuCp2 andRu(thd)3 processes, respectively. Ir(acac)3 was evapo-rated at 150 °C, RuCp2 at 60 °C, and Ru(thd)3 at 100 °C.The oxygen flow rate in the iridium process was variedbetween 5 and 20 sccm, and was the same as in thesubsequent metal process. The iridium films were grownjust prior to ruthenium deposition at the same tempera-ture as the ruthenium films.The crystal structure of the films was determined usinga AXS D8 Advance x-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument(Bruker, Karlsruhe), which was also used in the x-rayreflectivity (XRR) measurements. The film thicknesseswere determined by XRR and by energy dispersive x-rayspectroscopy (EDX), the EDX data being analyzed byusing a GMR electron probe thin film microanalysis pro-gram.28 The film roughnesses were analyzed by XRRand by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM meas-urements were carried out in intermittent-contact modeusing AutoProbe CP Research AFM (ThermoMicro-scopes, Sunnyvale, CA). Sheet resistances were meas-ured by the standard four-point probe method. Impuritycontents were analyzed by time-of-flight elastic recoil de-tection analysis (TOF-ERDA) using 53 MeV 127I10+ ions.III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPlatinum thin films were grown by ALD fromMeCpPtMe3 and oxygen at temperatures of 200300 °C.We have previously reported an ALD process for plati-num from the same platinum precursor using air as theoxygen source.23 In that process, practically no film wasobtained at deposition temperatures lower than 300 °C.Thus, deposition temperature of platinum films is signifi-cantly lowered when pure oxygen is used as the reactivegas instead of air. The air flow rate in our previous studyFIG. 1. Structure of the palladium -ketoiminato precursorPd(keim2)2.T. Aaltonen et al.: Atomic layer deposition of noble metalsJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 19, No. 11, Nov 20043354was 40 sccm, whereas the oxygen flow rate in the currentstudy was 20 sccm. Thus, the higher oxygen partial pres-sure used in this study was essential for the deposition ofplatinum films at temperatures lower than 300 °C.Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of theplatinum film-growth rate, the film thicknesses being de-termined by EDX and XRR. The growth rate was about0.30 Å cycle?1 at 200 °C and about 0.51 Å cycle?1 at300 °C. In our previous study, growth rates of about0.50 Å cycle?1 were obtained when air was used as theoxygen source at 300 °C.23 Thus, at 300 °C the oxygensource or the oxygen partial pressure do not have a sig-nificant effect on growth rate.Dependence of the grain size and the surface rough-ness of the platinum films on the deposition temperaturewas studied by AFM. Figure 3 shows AFM images of a45-nm film grown at 250 °C and a 50-nm film grownat 300 °C. A 30-nm film grown at 200 °C looked verysimilar to the film grown at 250 °C. The root meansquare (RMS) surface roughnesses, obtained from2 m × 2 m scans, were 0.8 nm for both the filmsgrown at 200 and 250 °C. As can be seen in Fig. 3, thegrains in the film grown at 300 °C are clearly larger thanin the film grown at 250 °C. The increased grain size alsoaffects the surface roughness, which is 1.2 nm for thefilm grown at 300 °C. In our previous study, the RMSsurface roughness of a 50-nm film grown at 300 °C fromMeCpPtMe3 using air as the oxygen source was about4 nm. This is much higher than the roughness of the filmgrown at 300 °C in this study using oxygen as the reac-tion gas. Thus, smoother platinum films are obtainedwhen oxygen instead of air is used as the reactive gas.This may be due to a higher nucleation density at higheroxygen partial pressure.Platinum films grown at 300 °C in our previous studywere strongly (111) oriented.23 The XRD pattern inFig. 4 shows that the platinum films have a preferred(111) crystal orientation even at the lowest depositiontemperature of 200 °C. The (111) surface has the lowestsurface energy and is therefore the most favorable crystalorientation. Resistivities of the platinum films were low;a 30-nm film grown at 200 °C had a resistivity of about17 cm, and a 50-nm film grown at 300 °C of about13 cm. Adhesion of the films grown on Al2O3 and oniridium was good, as all the films passed the tape test.The films grown in our previous study23 suffered frompoor adhesion. Thus, better adhesion is obtained whenthe platinum films are grown using oxygen instead of airas the reaction gas.FIG. 2. Growth rate of the platinum films grown from MeCpPtMe3 asa function of the deposition temperature, the film thicknesses beingmeasured by EDX and XRR. The MeCpPtMe3 and oxygen pulse timeswere 0.7 and 1.0 s, respectively, and the purge period between thepulses was 0.7 s.FIG. 3. AFM images of 2 m × 2 m regions of (a) a 45-nm platinumfilm grown at 250 °C, with a total z-range of 6.1 nm, and (b) a 50-nmplatinum film grown at 300 °C, with a total z-range of 9.7 nm. Thez-scale for both images spans 10 nm.T. Aaltonen et al.: Atomic layer deposition of noble metalsJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 19, No. 11, Nov 2004 3355The impurity contents of the platinum films were ana-lyzed by TOF-ERDA. The amount of impurities waslower in the films grown at 300 and 250 °C than in thefilm grown at 200 °C. Films grown at 300 and 250 °Chad hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen content of less than0.3 at.% each. The film grown at 200 °C containedslightly more impurities, but, however, less than 0.5 at.%each. The increased impurity content in the film grown at200 °C is most likely caused by lower reactivity of theprecursors at the lowest deposition temperature.Palladium films were grown from Pd(keim2)2 andoxygen at temperatures of 250 and 275 °C. Only peaksfrom metallic palladium could be seen in the diffractionpatterns measured by XRD. As the face-centered-cubicmetals platinum23 and iridium18 grown by ALD, also thepalladium films had a preferred (111) crystal orientation.Adhesion of the palladium films to the Al2O3 layer waspoor. Therefore, about 15-nm thick iridium film was de-posited on the substrate just prior to palladium depositionto improve the adhesion. At 275 °C, mirror-like palla-dium films were obtained when the oxygen flow rate was20 sccm. However, when the oxygen flow rate was in-creased to 40 sccm, the films became milky-like and hadvery rough surfaces. Surface roughening with increasingair flow rate has been observed also with ruthenium filmsgrown by ALD from RuCp2.15The dependence of the film-growth rate on thePd(keim2)2 and the oxygen pulse times was studied at adeposition temperature of 250 °C. The film-growth ratedid not saturate to a constant value but increased withincreasing precursor pulse times. With Pd(keim2)2 pulsetime of 1.0 s and oxygen pulse time of 2.0 s, growth rateof 0.60 Å cycle?1 was obtained. Low reactivity of theprecursors is one possible reason for the lack of satura-tion of the growth rate at pulse times up to 2 s. Theincrease in the growth rate with increasing Pd(keim2)2pulse time may also be caused by thermal self-decomposition of Pd(keim2)2 since metallic palladiumwas also deposited on the hot walls of the precursorsource tube. The impurity content of a palladium filmgrown at 250 °C was 0.3 at.% hydrogen, 0.5 at.% carbon,0.1 at.% nitrogen, 1.0 at.% oxygen, and 0.1 at.% fluorine,as determined by TOF-ERDA.Ruthenium thin films were grown from two rutheniumprecursors RuCp2 and Ru(thd)3, and oxygen. Rutheniumfilms were obtained from RuCp2 on as-deposited iridiumalready at a deposition temperature of 225 °C, whereasno film growth took place on as-deposited Al2O3 at tem-peratures lower than 275 °C. When Ru(thd)3 was used asthe ruthenium precursor, films were obtained on iridiumat 250 °C, whereas no film was grown on Al2O3 at tem-peratures lower than 325 °C. These low-temperature lim-its of 275 and 325 °C on Al2O3 are the same as for thefilms grown on Al2O3 using air as a precursor.15,16 Thus,unlike in the platinum process described above, the oxy-gen partial pressure does not affect the onset temperatureof the ruthenium film growth. The results show, how-ever, that the onset temperature can be lowered by usingthe iridium seed layer. This indicates that the film growthon Al2O3 at low temperatures is restricted by the lowreactivity of the ruthenium precursor and oxygen on theinitial Al2O3 surface. The catalytic activity of the iridiumfilm, however, promotes the onset of the ruthenium filmgrowth, and after the ruthenium film covers the surface,the film growth proceeds by self-catalyzation. It was alsotested that the platinum films grown at low temperaturesby the process presented in this paper serve as seed layersfor ruthenium deposition, as well.Growth rates of the ruthenium films from RuCp2 andoxygen on iridium surface are shown in Fig. 5 as a func-tion of the deposition temperature. The growth rate in-creases linearly with increasing deposition temperaturefrom about 0.12 Å cycle?1 at 225 °C to about 0.35 Åcycle?1 at 275 °C. On Al2O3, the ruthenium growth rateat 275 °C was only 0.23 Å cycle?1, which is much lowerthan the growth rate of 0.35 Å cycle?1 on the iridium seedlayer. One explanation for this difference is a long incu-bation period at the beginning of the film growth onAl2O3, which decreases the total growth rate. Such anFIG. 4.

Growth rate of the ruthenium films grown from RuCp2 oniridium as a function of the deposition temperature, the film thick-nesses being measured by EDX and XRR. The RuCp2 and oxygenpulse times were 0.5 and 0.2 s, respectively, and the purge periodbetween the pulses was 0.5 s.T. Aaltonen et al.: Atomic layer deposition of noble metalsJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 19, No. 11, Nov 20043356incubation period was observed in our previous study15for ruthenium films grown on Al2O3 at 300 °C. Further-more, when air was used as the oxygen source the growthrate was only 0.13 Å cycle?1 on Al2O3 at 275 °C15 whilewith oxygen the growth rate thus was 0.23 Å cycle?1.Kwon et al.21 have reported that the growth rate of ru-thenium films grown by ALD from Ru(EtCp)2 and oxy-gen depends on the oxygen partial pressure.The films grown from Ru(thd)3 and oxygen on iridiumhad a growth rate of 0.15 Å cycle?1 at 250 °C, which wasthe low-temperature limit for the process. This limit ishigher than for the RuCp2 process indicating thatRu(thd)3 has lower reactivity than RuCp2. On Al2O3 sur-face, film growth takes place only at 325 °C or higher. At325 °C the growth rate was 0.35 Å cycle?1 on the iridiumsurface which is only slightly higher than the growth rateof 0.33 Å cycle?1 measured in our previous study16 onAl2O3 when air was used as the oxygen precursor.Figure 6 shows XRD patterns of ruthenium filmsgrown at 250 °C from RuCp2 and Ru(thd)3. The filmsgrown from RuCp2 at 225250 °C were slightly (101)oriented, whereas the films grown at 275 °C were ran-domly oriented. No differences in the crystal orientationcould be seen in the films grown from RuCp2 at 275 °Con Al2O3 and iridium. As Fig. 6 shows, the films grownat 250 °C from Ru(thd)3 have a slightly preferred (002)crystal orientation. The (002) orientation is characteristicfor the films grown from Ru(thd)3, as the films grown at250325 °C in this study, and the films grown at 325450 °C in our previous study,16 all had a preferred (002)crystal orientation. Thus, the choice of the rutheniumprecursor affects the crystal orientation of the rutheniumfilms grown by ALD.IV. CONCLUSIONPlatinum thin films can be grown by ALD at lowdeposit ion temperatures of 200300 °C fromMeCpPtMe3 and oxygen. The low-temperature limit ofthis process using pure oxygen as the reactant is signifi-cantly lower than previously reported for the process inwhich air was used as the oxygen source. The platinumfilms had low resistivities and good adhesion to the sub-strate. Palladium films were grown from Pd(keim2)2 andoxygen at deposition temperatures of 250 and 275 °C, butthe film growth did not saturate to a constant value at theprocess conditions. Ruthenium films were obtained oniridium seed layers at lower deposition temperatures thanon Al3O3. The crystal orientation of the ruthenium filmsdepends on the precursor.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSFacilities provided by the Electron Microscopy Unit atthe Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Hel-sinki were used for the EDX analysis.
