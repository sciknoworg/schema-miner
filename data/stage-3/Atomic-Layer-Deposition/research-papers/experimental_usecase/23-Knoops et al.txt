Both the TaN and TiN films had a cubic phasecomposition with a relatively low resistivity TaN: 380  cm; TiN: 150  cm. Dissimilar from the TiN properties, thematerial properties of the TaN films were found to depend strongly on the plasma exposure time. Preliminary tests on planarsubstrates were carried out revealing the potential of the TaN and TiN films as Cu and Li diffusion barriers in through-silicon viaand silicon-integrated thin-film battery applications, respectively. For the specific films studied, it was found that TiN showedbetter barrier properties than TaN for both application areas. The TiN films were an effective barrier to Cu diffusion and had noCu diffusion for anneal temperatures up to 700°C. The TiN films showed low Li intercalation during electrochemical charging anddischarging.© 2008 The Electrochemical Society.

One area placingstringent demands on the barrier layer is Cu interconnect technol-ogy. Here, barrier layers are needed to prevent Cu diffusion into thesilicon substrate. Because of scaling down of feature sizes, thesefilms need to be thin 5 to 10 nm and deposited conformally infeatures with increasingly higher aspect ratios. Furthermore, thefilms need to be conductive to maintain sufficient electrical connec-tion to the underlying metallization layer.Copper diffusion barriers are also needed in the emerging field ofthree-dimensional 3D stacked die integration. Here, copper-filledthrough-silicon vias TSVs offer a solution to the wiring crisis innext-generation semiconductor devices.1-4 3D integration and, con-sequently, Cu diffusion barriers are also of strategic relevance forthe More than Moore approach in which several functionalitiesand components computing, processing, storage, transmitting, sens-ing, etc. are combined in, for example, System-in-Package SiPdevices.5A development being part of the More than Moore approach isresearch toward 3D integrated solid-state thin-film batteries.6-8These batteries have the potential to provide the high-density stor-age capacity required for future miniaturized autonomous wirelessdevices or as a backup power supply in circuits.6,7 The batteries arebased on Li ions as charge carriers and high aspect ratio structures insilicon to obtain high storage densities. The battery stack consists ofseveral functional layers diffusion barrier layer, anode, electrolyte,cathode, current collector deposited conformally in these 3D struc-tures. Because silicon easily takes up elemental Li, it is an attractiveanode material. However, to prevent the loss of Li from the Si anodeto the underlying Si substrate while still providing an electrical con-nection to the anode layer, a conductive and conformal Li diffusionbarrier film is required in-between.6,7As Cu diffusion barrier materials, mainly refractory metallic sys-tems Ti, Ta, W, Mo, Cr, etc. and their nitrides are used due to theircharacteristic chemical inertness and low diffusion rate related totheir high melting points.9,10 Furthermore, because of the relativelylow resistivity of these materials they can be directly used as metalelectrodes in capacitor structures and as metal gate electrodes forcomplementary metal oxide semiconductor.11,12 Among these mate-* Electrochemical Society Student Member.** Electrochemical Society Active Member.z E-mail: h.c.m.knoops@tue.nl; w.m.m.kessels@tue.nlDownloaded 17 Nov 2008 to 131.155.151.77. Redistribution subject to Erials, TaN and TiN have been considered most often and these ma-terials are known to be good diffusion barriers, especially forCu.9,10,12-14 Both sputtered TaN and TiN have been used as a diffu-sion barrier for TSV experiments.4,15 Note, that the adhesion of Cuon TiN might not be sufficient for the small feature sizes in the moretraditional interconnect technology. Nevertheless TiN is consideredto be a good candidate for the relatively large vias used in 3Dintegration.1,4In this article, we report on TaN and TiN films deposited withremote plasma atomic layer deposition ALD. In principle, thistechnique is capable of depositing high-quality films with a goodconformality in high aspect ratio structures.12,16-19 Because the mi-crostructure and the composition of the films could have a largeinfluence on the diffusion barrier properties,14,17,20-22 we have stud-ied the material properties of the deposited TaN and TiN films forvarious deposition conditions. In addition, preliminary diffusion bar-rier experiments were carried out on planar wafers to test the per-formance of TaN and TiN films as Cu and Li diffusion barriers infuture SiP applications. Furthermore, by comparing the diffusionbarrier properties for both Cu and Li, more insight into the barriercharacteristics of TaN and TiN has been obtained.ExperimentalRemote plasma ALD reactors. The TaN and TiN films investi-gated and used in the barrier experiments were deposited using tworemote plasma ALD reactors. The TaN films were deposited usingthe homebuilt ALD-I reactor as described extensively by Langereiset al.23 The TiN films in this work were deposited using the OxfordInstruments FlexAL reactor, and this process is described by Heil etal.24 In this work, we describe the deposition of both materials andreport on the Cu and Li diffusion barrier properties on planar filmstacks.Both ALD reactors have the same basic configuration as sche-matically represented in Fig. 1a. The reactors consisted of a deposi-tion chamber, a pump unit, an inductively coupled plasma source,and a precursor dosing system. The pump unit and plasma sourcewere connected to the deposition chamber through gate valves. Thechamber was pumped by a combination of a turbomolecular pumpand a rotary pump reaching a base pressure of 10?5 Torr by over-night pumping. The ALD-I reactor was an open-load reactor thatcould handle wafers with a diameter up to 100 mm. The FlexALreactor could handle wafers with diameters up to 200 mm, and thesewafers were loaded through a load lock. Unlike the ALD-I reactor,CS license or copyright; see http://www.ecsdl.org/terms_use.jspG288 Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 155 12 G287-G294 2008the FlexAL reactor had a higher maximum power setting for theplasma source 600 W instead of 100 W and was also equippedwith mass flow controllers and an automated pressure control valve.Figure 1b schematically shows a typical ALD cycle used for bothprocesses. The cycle began with the precursor dosage. For the TaNprocess TaNCH325 pentakisdimethylaminotantalum, PDMATprecursor was heated to 75°C, and an Ar flow was used to transportthe TaNCH325 vapor into the chamber by bubbling. A dosingtime of 5 s was used to obtain saturation. For TiN deposition, TiCl4was dosed using a fast switch valve minimum switch time was10 ms. Because of the high vapor pressure of TiCl4, only a shortdosage time of 40 ms was required to achieve saturation while keep-ing the TiCl4 at 30°C. After purging with Ar, the gate valve betweenplasma source and chamber was opened and the plasma ALD half-cycle was started. For the TaN process, an H2 plasma was used; forthe TiN process, we used an H2N2 plasma. After the plasma step,the next cycle started again with an Ar purge. Table I summarizesthe details of the baseline conditions used throughout this work.Thin-film analysis. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry SE wasused to study the thin-film growth during the deposition processeson both ALD reactors.

Redistribution subject to Erent source and voltage meter. The resistivity was obtained from theslope of the currentvoltage I-V curve, and the film thickness wasdeduced from the SE measurements. The atomic compositions andareal atomic densities of the films were determined from Rutherfordbackscattering spectrometry and elastic recoil detection using2 MeV 4He+ ions. Mass densities were calculated from the arealdensities using the thickness data obtained by SE. The microstruc-ture of the films was studied using X-ray diffraction XRD with aPhilips XPert MPD diffractometer equipped with a Cu K source1.54 Å radiation. The thickness and mass density were corrobo-rated by X-ray reflectometry measurements performed on a BrukerD8 Advance X-ray diffractometer.Cu and Li diffusion barrier experiments. For the Cu diffusionbarrier experiments, test structures were fabricated by sputter depos-iting Cu films 50 nm in thickness onto air exposed barrier films30 nm in thickness which were deposited on 100 mm HF-lastn-type silicon wafers P-doped, resistivity of 1020  cm. Thesestacks were annealed in a vacuum oven 10?6 Torr together withcontrol stacks that had no Cu film on top. For the FPP resistivitymeasurements, the samples were heated up to the anneal tempera-ture at a ramp rate of 5°C/min. At the moment the anneal tempera-ture was reached, the samples were cooled down to 150°C at acooling rate of 5°C/min after which the sample was heated to thenext anneal temperature. The anneal temperature was increased insteps of 50°C up to 700°C. During these thermal cycles, the sheetresistance was measured with a FPP from the top side of the teststructure. In the analysis of these measurements, the sheet resistanceat 150°C was considered to prevent any intrinsic influence of thetemperature dependence of the Cu, TaN, TiN, and Si resistivity. Thestacks for the XRD measurements were annealed using a slightlydifferent procedure, each stack was individually heated up to theanneal temperature at a ramp rate of 5°C/min and kept at this tem-perature for 30 min, after which they were slowly cooled inside thefurnace.For the Li diffusion barrier test, cyclic voltammetry was con-ducted with an Autolab PGSTAT30 Ecochemie B.V., Utrecht, TheNetherlands and galvanostatic cycling was performed using aM4300 galvanostat Maccor, Tulsa, USA. The procedure used wasidentical to the one described by Baggetto et al.7 An n-type siliconwafer Sb-doped, resistivity of 822 m cm was used as a sub-strate to facilitate the electrical connection to the barrier layer. Thesubstrate had a native oxide surface.Results and DiscussionRemote plasma ALD of TiN and TaN films. TiN and TaNfilms were deposited with various plasma exposure times using thebaseline conditions listed in Table I.

BothTiN and TaN show a linear increase in thickness with the number ofcycles.The TiN properties showed almost no dependence on the plasmaexposure time, only a slight decrease in Cl content and decrease inresistivity was observed for longer plasma exposures. The TiN filmsinvestigated had an N/Ti ratio of 0.93  0.02 and all contained arelatively low level of impurities.24 This is in agreement with pre-vious work where the combination of TiCl4 and H2N2 plasmashowed excellent material properties compared to other ALD TiNprocesses.26 Note that, for the Cu diffusion barrier experiments,slightly different deposition conditions were used 400°C substratetemperature and a 500 W plasma with a H2N2 608 sccm gasmixture, which resulted in a slight increase in growth rate andresistivity.Table II.

Redistribution subject to EThe TaN properties depend strongly on the plasma exposuretime. This can be explained by the fact that TaN can exist in manycrystal phases, depending on the Ta/N ratio. Stable crystal phasesranging from conductive Ta2N to semiconductive Ta3N5 have beenreported.27 The TaN films obtained with a 3 s H2 plasma were rea-sonably conductive 3400  cm, had a relatively low N contentof 32%, and had the cubic crystal phase see below. The N contentfurther reduced down to 25% when the plasma exposure time wasincreased, which also resulted in a higher mass density and lowerresistivity as low as 380  cm, Table II. H2N2 mixtures andNH3 were also used as the plasma gasses, but these conditions re-sulted in a large increase in resistivity e.g., 1.1  104  cm for a98:2 H2N2 plasma and even led to the semiconducting Ta3N5phase.23 Because our interest lies in conductive barrier films, onlyfilms deposited by H2 plasma were investigated in the current work.Figures 3a and b show the growth per cycle and FPP resistivityof the films as a function of plasma exposure time. During the firstfew seconds of plasma exposure, both processes show a large in-crease in the growth per cycle after which saturation takes place. ForTaN a so-called soft saturation behavior is observed while the satu-ration in growth per cycle is much clearer for the TiN case. This softsaturation can be explained by the aforementioned dependence ofthe material properties on the plasma exposure time see Table II.23The change in material properties for TaN is also evident by thelarge change in resistivity with plasma exposure time Fig. 3b. ForTiN, only minor changes take place that can be attributed to a smallreduction in the Cl-impurity content.The microstructure of the films was investigated by XRD and themeasured spectra for TaN and TiN films deposited under the base-line conditions of Table I are given in Fig. 4. For both films, it isclear that the material has a cubic phase structure as can be con-cluded from the comparison to the powder sample data.28 Both theTaN and TiN films show a strong preferential 200 growth directioncompared to the powder sample. Fréty et al. found that sputteredTaN also showed a preferential 200 growth direction depending onthe N2 pressure during deposition.22 For a TaN film of 800 cyclesdeposited using H2 plasma and TaNCH325 precursor, Kim et al.found no preferential direction,17 while Park et al. reported an in-crease of the 200 peak intensity using longer plasma exposures ands for various plasma exposure times.

Evidently, ahigher failure temperature indicates a higher barrier quality. Teststructures were fabricated by sputter depositing Cu films onto thebarrier layers as described in the experimental details. The TaN andTiN film were deposited on the Si substrates, where TaN was depos-ited using the baseline conditions Table I, and the TiN film wasdeposited under slightly modified conditions i.e., 400°C depositiontemperature, 500 W plasma with 60 sccm H2 and 8 sccm N2. Theseconditions result in very similar material properties as shown for thebaseline conditions Table II.For both barrier materials, two different experiments were car-ried out. First, the sheet resistance of a Cu-barrier-Si stack wasmonitored as a function of anneal temperature. Variation of Cu sheetresistance with anneal temperature is known to provide a good mea-sure of barrier performance.14,22,29,30 Barrier failure leads to a sig-(b)(a)Figure 3.

Redistribution subject to Enificant change in resistivity due to the formation of poorly conduc-tive Cu3Si,14,20,22,29 which will result in an increase in the sheetresistance due to the concurrent loss of Cu. As a reference, the sheetresistance of a barrier-Si stack was also measured to find possibleannealing effects and to investigate the thermal stability of the bar-rier material itself.Figure 5 shows the sheet resistance at 150°C of the TaNSi,TiNSi, CuTaNSi, and the CuTiNSi stacks as a function ofanneal temperature. The resistance of the TaNSi stack decreases fortemperatures of 400°C. The fact that this occurs at 400°C insteadof just above the deposition temperature 225°C demonstrates thethermal stability of the TaN. A similar but less pronounced annealingeffect is visible for the TiNSi stack possibly related to the higherdeposition temperature of 400°C. Because of the Cu film, the CuTaNSi and CuTiNSi stacks show a very low sheet resistance0.2 / and 0.1 /, respectively, which is lost for both barriersfor annealing temperatures of 600°C, when the sheet resistancesuddenly increases.To attribute the change in sheet resistance with annealing to bar-rier failure or another effect, a second experiment was performed;XRD spectra were measured for the stacks after annealing at differ-ent temperatures. These spectra should reveal possible Cu3Si forma-tion and the concurrent loss of Cu. For completeness, it should benoted that the XRD spectra for the annealed TaN and TiN films(a)(b)Figure 4.

This indicates that the reduction in re-sistivity of the TiN and TaN in the TiNSi and TaNSi stacks shownin Fig. 5 is not caused by a measurable change in microstructure.The XRD spectra for the CuTaNSi stacks annealed at 200,400, 600, 650, and 700°C are shown in Fig. 6. The most intenselines for the diffraction patterns of powder samples of cubic TaN,Cu, and Cu3Si are also indicated in Fig. 6. Three observations can bemade when comparing the XRD spectra: i the TaN lines are notaffected by the anneal, ii the intensity of the Cu lines drops for thesamples annealed at 650 and 700°C, and, most importantly, iiiCu3Si lines appear for the samples annealed above 600°C. TheseCu3Si lines are best visible at 2 values of 65 and 82°. These ob-servations are therefore in agreement with the result obtained by thesheet resistance measurements i.e., between 600 and 650°C Custarts diffusing through the TaN film and the barrier fails.Figure 5.

The spectra areshifted vertically for clarity.Downloaded 17 Nov 2008 to 131.155.151.77. Redistribution subject to EFor sputtered TaN films ranging from 25 to 50 nm thick, it hasbeen reported that Cu diffusion starts between 650 and 700°C,13,29,31where the rate of diffusion is lower for films with higher Ncontent.29 Kim et al. reported a failure temperature of 800°C for a12 nm thick TaN0.750.8 film deposited by ALD using a 5 s H2plasma.17 The same group also reported that similar to sputteredbarrier films an increase in N content further increases the failuretemperature.17,21 However, it should also be noted that increasingthe N content of the TaN film increases the resistivity, which can beundesirable in barrier applications. Our results are in qualitativeagreement with those reported in literature, considering the fact thata lower failure temperature 600650°C was observed for TaNfilms with lower N content TaN0.49, Table II. Moreover, a differ-ence in microstructure can also have a large effect on failuretemperature.17,20 We observed a preferential 200 growth directionwhile Kim et al. did not report such a preferential growthdirection.17 This is a factor that likely contributes to the difference infailure temperature because a strong preferential growth can be re-lated to a columnar microstructure, which gives rise to fast diffusionpathways.22,29The XRD spectra for the CuTiNSi stacks annealed at 200, 400,600, and 700°C are shown in Fig. 7. The most intense lines for thediffraction patterns of powder samples of cubic TiN, Cu, and Cu3Siare also indicated in Fig. 7. Two conclusions can be drawn whencomparing the XRD spectra: the TiN lines are not affected by theanneal and the Cu lines become more intense and narrower forhigher anneal temperatures. Most importantly, no Cu3Si lines areobserved, which points to no barrier failure up to a temperature of700°C.To further investigate the evolution of the Cu in the stack withanneal temperature for both the CuTaNSi and CuTiNSi stacks,the intensity of the strong Cu111 peak 2 43.3° was determinedand the crystallite size was obtained from the full width at halfmaximum of this peak using Scherrers equation.32 Figures 8a and bshow the intensity and the crystallite size vs anneal temperature forCu111 in the CuTaNSi and CuTiNSi stacks, respectively. TheCu peak intensity shows an increase with anneal temperature forboth TaN and TiN up to 600°C, indicating Cu crystallization. TheCu crystallization is in agreement with the FPP results in Fig. 5,showing a small decrease in resistance. Similar increases in Cu111intensity have been reported in the literature.13,14,29,31 Above an an-neal temperature of 600°C, the Cu peak intensity from the CuFigure 7.

Acompletely different behavior is observed for Cu in the CuTiNSistack. The intensity increases strongly while the crystallite size alsoincreases slightly, especially for a temperature of 600°C. Thissuggests a strong crystallization behavior that can be related to highbulk diffusion inside the Cu above 600°C due to its low meltingpoint 1085°C.Because no Cu3Si peaks are formed and the Cu peak intensity isnot decreasing for the CuTiNSi stack, the increase in sheet resis-tance for temperatures of 600°C in Fig. 5 cannot be explained bythe loss of Cu. Figure 9 shows scanning electron microscope SEMimages of the surface of the CuTiNSi stack: the as-deposited filmFig. 9a shows a smooth surface compared to the annealed 700°CCu surface Fig. 9b, which reveals a clear roughening of the Cufilm. Annealing is reported to cause roughening of Cu films onpoorly wettable surfaces such as TiN.33,34 When a larger area isobserved 30 m width, Fig. 9c, a discontinuous Cu film is visible.The discontinuous Cu film explains why the resistance increases fortemperatures of 600°C.35 Because of the large crystallite growthabove 600°C, poorly connected islands are formed, resulting in anincrease in sheet resistance. Apparently the 50 nm Cu film is notthick enough to prevent this effect. Contrary to TiN, Ta-rich TaN,which is used for the CuTaNSi stacks, has been reported to haveexcellent wettability for Cu.36 For TiN, the resistance increase istherefore not caused by Cu diffusion through the barrier, suggestingexcellent barrier properties. A method to improve the wettability ofTiN by surface treatments will be reported in a future publication.37(b)(a)Figure 8.

Redistribution subject to EFor stacks with 25 nm of sputtered TiN, failure temperatureswere reported ranging from 550 to 750°C for increasing TiNmass density 4.995.12 g cm?3.14 It is interesting to note that thedensity of the films in our work is lower 4.0 g cm?3, Table II whilethe barrier properties are still good up to 700°C. Uhm and Jeonreported a resistance increase using FPP measurements at tempera-tures above 600°C, Cu3Si peaks in XRD spectra at 550°C, andsmall defects using an etch pit test at 500°C for ALD TiN filmsdeposited at 450°C using TiCl4 and NH3.38 Comparing these failuretemperatures to our results indicate excellent barrier properties forthe TiN films deposited by remote plasma ALD.Li diffusion barrier properties. In 3D integrated all-solid-statebatteries, the barrier layers must prevent diffusion of Li from theactive battery layers into the substrate over the entire electrochemi-cal potential range used. A thin barrier layer is desired 10100 nmwhile maintaining the barrier properties and sufficient electrical con-duction. Baggetto et al. reported the feasibility of using sputteredTaN and TiN films as planar Li diffusion barriers.7 To assess theprospects of using high aspect ratio 5 structures in future 3Dbatteries, TaN and TiN films deposited with ALD were investigatedin this work.To do so, the electrochemical properties of 60 nm thick planarTiN and TaN films deposited by remote plasma ALD under thebaseline conditions were studied see Table I and II. Figure 10shows cyclic voltammograms of the films measured in a Li-containing electrolyte solution under the experimental conditions asdescribed by Baggetto et al.7 The TiN film shows a very low currentover the entire potential range, indicating low reactivity toward Liand demonstrating its capability as Li diffusion barrier. The reactiv-ity of the TaN film is much higher than that of the TiN film, asindicated by the intensity of the current peaks at 1 and 1.5 V.These peaks can be ascribed to tantalate structures, such as Ta2O5,39which are known to be active intercalation materials below 1.5 V.As can be seen from the atomic composition Table II, a significantfraction of oxygen is present in the TaN films.
