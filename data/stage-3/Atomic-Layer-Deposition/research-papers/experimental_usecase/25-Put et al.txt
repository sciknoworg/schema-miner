At present conformal coating of the solidelectrolyte remains one of the key hurdles for the implementation of such devices. In the present work we investigate atomic layerdeposition (ALD) as means of conformal deposition of lithium phosphate (Li3PO4) and nitrogen doped lithium phosphates (LiPON).These processes are characterized here to obtain the highest possible Li-ion conductivity. Li3PO4 is shown to yield a conductivity of10?10 S/cm at 25°C. On the other hand, an optimized LiPON process gave rise to a Li-ion conductivity of 510?7 S/cm at 25°C. Inaddition, good conformality of the LiPON process was shown on high aspect ratio pillars. Furthermore, a solid state battery devicewas fabricated comprising a Li4Ti5O12 cathode, a 70 nm thick ALD LiPON solid electrolyte and a metallic lithium anode. Thisfinding indicates that a layer down to 70 nm can be made pinhole free.© 2019 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10.1149/2.1191906jes]Manuscript submitted December 11, 2018; revised manuscript received March 27, 2019. Published April 12, 2019. This was Paper347 presented at the Honolulu, Hawaii, Meeting of the Society, October 27, 2016.Research into solid state 3D batteries has recently attracted a lotof attention as alternative for current liquid battery cells.1,2 This isdriven by their high capacity and power density which should enablefast charging rates in combination with high capacity. Furthermore,the all-solid state concept removes the flammable liquid electrolytefrom the cell which greatly benefits its safety.A nanoscale 3D solid state cell was recently demonstrated.3,4 Oneof the main challenges when fabricating such device is the confor-mality of the layers on large area substrates. This is especially criticalfor the solid electrolyte, as a single pinhole will short circuit the en-tire battery. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as one ofthe candidates to enable conformal coating.5 ALD is a vapor phasedeposition technique based on sequential self-limiting surface reac-tions. It has been demonstrated that ALD enables conformal coatingof different large area structures.6One of the most interesting solid electrolyte candidates is nitrogen-doped Li3PO4 (LiPON). This material is currently the most frequentlyused solid state electrolyte. The reason for this being its good stabilitywindow (0-5V), low electronic leakage and good Li-ion conductivity(10?6 S/cm at 25°C).7 On the other hand, also Li3PO4 has been shownas solid electrolyte however with a smaller stability window and lowerionic conductivity (10?8 S/cm at 25°C) in amorphous form.7 Crys-talline Li3PO4 on the other hand only provides a conductivity of 10?18S/cm at 25°C. Recently, ALD depositions of both Li3PO4 and LiPONhave been reported in literature.8,9The increased ionic conductivity of amorphous LiPON films orig-inates from the shorter phosphate chains compared to Li3PO4. Thischain shortening is caused by the addition of nitrogen which dis-rupts the continuous P-O-P chains, present in the Li3PO4. In this waya more distorted structure is formed which facilitates easier Li-iontransport.1012 Nitrogen can be incorporated in LiPON in different po-sitions: forming a double bond (P=N-P, doubly coordinated nitrogen)or 3 single bonds (P-N<, triply coordinated nitrogen).12In the present work we demonstrate the ALD deposition of bothLi3PO4 and LiPON. We investigate the impact of different processconditions such as processing temperature and plasma power on thecrystallinity and ionic conductivity of the different materials.ExperimentalAll depositions presented here were carried out in a FlexAl ALDsystem (Oxford instruments, base pressure < 1 10?6 Torr). As precur-sors lithium tert-butoxide (LiOtBu, Sigma-Aldrich), tri-methyl phos-phate (TMP Sigma-Aldrich) and H2O were used. The LiOtBu and?Electrochemical Society Member.zE-mail: putb@imec.beTMP precursors were heated to 140°C and 70°C, respectively. All theprecursor lines were heated as well to prevent precursor condensation.Layers were deposited using a pulsing time of 5s for LiOtBu, 30 msfor H2O and 500ms for TMP. In the case of H2O and TMP a reactionstep of 5s is added after the precursor pulse. A 7.5s Ar purge is usedto evacuate the unreacted precursor molecules after the LiOtBu andTMP steps. After the H2O step a 15s purge is applied. When deposit-ing LiPON, similar pulsing steps as described for Li3PO4 were used,however the purging times were extended to 30s and a N2 plasma stepwas added after the TMP.Depositions were performed on silicon substrates coated with70 nm- thick sputtered TiN (AMAT, Endura). Film growth was verifiedby in-situ ellipsometery using a J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000U (visibleand near-infrared 0.755.0 eV) ellipsometer. The acquired data werefitted using the Complete Ease software employing a Cauchy model.Conformality of the depositions was checked by scanning elec-tron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova) on etched Si micropillar arrays.The stoichiometry of the films was determined by elastic recoil detec-tion (ERD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For XPS aK-Alpha system from Thermo Scientific was used. ERD was con-ducted using a primary ion beam of Cl4+ accelerated to 8 MeVby a 2 MV tandem accelerator. In this setup, the forward recoiledand scattered ions were detected with a time-of-flight energy (ToFE)telescope. Crystallinity of the films was probed by X-ray diffrac-tion (Xpert Panalytical) using Cu K? radiation in grazing incidenceconfiguration.For the dry electrical characterization of the LiPON layers,metalelectrolytemetal (MEM) capacitors were fabricated. Goldmetal dots were deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evapo-ration (Alcatel). The dots had diameters varying from 100 to 500?m,allowing the determination of perimeter leakage to ensure the con-tact quality. Electrical measurements were carried out in a micro-manipulated cryogenic probe station kept under a vacuum (104105 Torr) to avoid effects of moisture during the measurements.Care was taken to avoid exposure of the LiPO(N) layers to theambient for prolonged periods to prevent contamination or reactionof the surface. Heating and cooling (using liquid N2) was carriedout over a range from 200 to 350 K. Solid-state impedance spec-troscopy (SIS) was carried out using an HP4284A precision LCRmeter over a frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz. The AC sig-nal was always applied to the bottom contact (TiN or Pt) to limitnoise.Impedance spectroscopy results were analyzed by fitting an equiv-alent circuit to the data, using MEISP software (Kumho ChemicalLaboratories). The obtained fits had a ?2 value in the range from 1 ×103 to 1 × 105. The relative standard deviation for all fitted valuesremained below 5%.) unless CC License in place (see abstract).  ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

XRD patterns of 40 nm Li3PO4 films deposited at different process-ing temperatures. Crystallinity of the layers is seen to increase with increasingtemperature.For the fabrication of a battery stack a 200 nm Li4Ti5O12 layer wasdeposited by RF sputtering (Pfeiffer, Spider) from a 4-in. Li4Ti5O12target on a 100 nm Pt/TiOx coated SiO2 substrate. This layer re-ceived a crystallization anneal for 20 min at 800°C. Subsequently a70 nm ALD LiPON layer is deposited as solid electrolyte. To conclude,1 ?m metallic lithium was thermally evaporated and functions here asanode, leading to the formation of a 1.5 V battery. The created batterywas characterized using an autolab (Metrohm) potentiostat operatedby Nova software (Metrohm Autolab).Results and DiscussionLi3PO4 characterization.As was mentioned before, the ionicconductivity of Li3PO4 is greatly impacted by the crystallinity of thematerial. Therefore the crystallinity of layers deposited using differentprocessing temperatures were examined using XRD (Figure 1).Figure 1 shows a clear reduction of the crystallinity of 40 nmLi3PO4 films when decreasing processing temperature. At 200°Cnearly amorphous films are formed. At processing temperatures lowerthan 200°C the growth per cycle (GPC) drops significantly. These con-ditions were not further investigated.The stoichiometry of different Li3PO4 films was investigated usingERD. This technique allows for highly accurate stoichiometry deter-mination of films constituted of light elements. In addition it can alsodetect hydrogen, contrary to e.g. XPS. For the different Li3PO4 layers,stoichiometries were found in the range Li2.43.2PO4.35. However, withdecreasing processing temperature an increase of the amount of hy-drogen is detected in the layer. This is likely caused by the incompletereaction between the TMP and the LiOtBu.The ionic conductivity of the material was determined by SISmeasurements using a metal-electrolyte-metal device. The obtainedimpedance spectra were fitted using an equivalent circuit model.This model consisted of a series resistance followed by two R-CPEbranches and terminated with another constant phase element (CPE),the model is shown in the supplementary information (SI). As suchit can be represented as Rs(R1-CPE)(R2-CPE)CPE, where the Rs cor-responds to the series resistance of the contact and wiring, the firstR1-CPE branch can be linked to the formation of an interface film,the second R2-CPE to the bulk conductivity.13 The final CPE el-ement accounts for the usage of a blocking contact and the asso-ciated double layer. The total impedance contribution of the solidelectrolyte thus consists of the sum of R1 and R2. In the presentwork the ionic conductivity is calculated from the sum of thesecomponents.Figure 2b depicts a strong increase in the Li-ion conductivity withdecreasing processing temperature for 40 nm Li3PO4 layers, attributedto the decrease of the crystallinity on reducing the processing temper-ature. Layers deposited at 200°C exhibit the largest ionic conductivityreaching a value of 1.4  10?10 S/cm at 25°C. Note the layers mea-sured here were only 40 nm thick and showed low electronic leakagecurrent.LiPON characterization.When a nitrogen plasma is added to theLi3PO4 deposition process, LiPON (nitrogen doped Li3PO4 glass) canbe formed. In the present work a nitrogen plasma exposure time of 20 swas used in all depositions. Both the effect of processing temperatureand plasma power on the Li-ion conductivity were examined.The incorporation of nitrogen into the Li3PO4 layers results inshortening of the P-O-P chains as explained above. In this way a moredisordered structure is created which increases ion conductivity. Theaddition of a nitrogen plasma step to the Li3PO4 process also resultsin the formation of amorphous material, independent of the depositiontemperature (Data not shown).The ionic conductivity of the LiPON layers depends on the amountof incorporated nitrogen. This was more closely investigated byFigure 2. (a) Amount of hydrogen and carbon impurities in 40 nm Li3PO4 layers deposited at different processing temperatures as determined by ERD. A clearincrease of the amount of incorporated hydrogen is seen on reducing the temperature. (b) Shows the dependency of the Li-ion conductivity, as determined byimpedance spectroscopy, on the processing temperature. A strong rise in conductivity is seen when reducing the processing temperature, attributed to the reducedcrystallinity of the layers.) unless CC License in place (see abstract).  ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

N and Li content of LiPON layers deposited underdifferent nitrogen plasma power and processing temperaturesettings. A clear increase in the amount of nitrogen is seenwhen increasing the plasma power. Simultaneously, the amount ofnitrogen is increased by reducing the processing temperature. Asexpected, the amount of Li is found to decrease when the amount ofnitrogen in the layer increases. This can be understood by the factthat the nitrogen substitutes oxygen in the Li3PO4 and, as oxygenis associated with a lithium ion, its removal also leads to a lowerlithium content.LiPON XPS 275°C 275°C 275°C 100°CCharacterization 100W 200W 300W 100WN (%) 2.9 3.5 4.3 6.3Li (%) 41 38.7 35.9 34.2XPS (results depicted in Table I). As the plasma power increasesmore nitrogen is incorporated in the layers, increasing from 2.9% at100 W up to 4.3% at 300 W. Additionally, more nitrogen is also in-corporated when the temperature is lowered, reaching a maximumof 6.3% for a layer deposited at 100°C using a plasma power of100 W.As XPS does not allow the detection of hydrogen, the stoi-chiometry of the LiPON layers was measured using ERD. A sto-ichiometry of Li1.9PO2.6N0.23 was found for a sample deposited at275°C 100W and a composition of Li1.8PO2.5N0.25 was found for alayer deposited at 200°C 100W. In these layers the hydrogen con-tent was 0.5% and carbon content was 0.2%. This is attributed tothe high reactivity of the nitrogen plasma which efficiently removesimpurities.The incorporation of nitrogen into LiPON can occur by forming adouble bond (P=N-P, doubly coordinated nitrogen) or 3 single bonds(P-N<, triply coordinated nitrogen) as explained above. The ratio oftriply to doubly coordinated nitrogen has a significant impact on theionic conductivity. Therefore the effect of the deposition conditionson the nitrogen binding states was investigated using XPS (shown inFigure 3a).Figure 3a shows that on lowering the processing temperature theamount of incorporated nitrogen increases. Additionally it can be seenthat when increasing the plasma power the amount of incorporatednitrogen increases as well but more importantly also the amount in atriply coordinated fashion. As this is most efficient in disrupting theO-P-O chains, increasing the plasma power is expected to lead to anincreased Li-ion conductivity.The ionic conductivity of the fabricated LiPON layers was againinvestigated using impedance spectroscopy measurements in a MEM-configuration. Fitting of the obtained impedance spectrum was per-formed using the model described above. The results of the impedancecharacterization is depicted in Figure 3b.Figure 3b addresses the changes in Li-ion conductivity of theLiPON films upon addition of a N2 plasma, increase in plasma powerand decrease in substrate temperature. As predicted by the discussionon the characterization of the material properties (Fig. 3a and Table I),the N2 plasma is essential in promoting the increase in Li-ion conduc-tivity up to 10?8 S/cm at 25°C. The increase in plasma power furtherpromotes the conductivity, up to a value of 2.107 S/cm at 25°C, asa result of the increase in triple coordination of N with respect todouble coordination. Moreover, a decrease in temperature down to200°C, enhances the conductivity up to 5.107 S/cm at 25°C becauseof further incorporation of N in the layer. No further improvements inconductivity are detected when further lowering the temperature downto 100°C.Also the conformality of the deposition was checked using SEMat different positions on a silicon etched pillar. These structures serveas large area structures for usage in 3D all solid state batteries. Theused pillars were 50 ?m high, had a diameter of 2 ?m and werecoated with a ?30 nm TiN current collector. On these pillars a 90 nmLiPON layer was deposited at a processing temperature of 275°Cand a plasma power of 100 W. Figure 4 shows three SEM picturesat different heights along the pillar. Image (a) is taken at the top ofthe pillar and shows a TiN layer of ?25 nm and a LiPON layer of?90 nm. Image (b) is taken half way the pillar and depicts a 30 nmTiN layer and 80 nm LiPON. The final image (c) is taken at the bot-tom of the pillar and shows a TiN layer of 28 nm and 70 nm ofLiPON. These results indicate that the conformality for this processis good.Solid state stack characterization.To demonstrate the function-ality of the LiPON solid electrolyte, a solid state battery was fabricatedusing Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as cathode, a lithium metal anode and a 70 nmFigure 3. (a) Core level XPS spectra for 40 nm LiPON films deposited under conditions of varying temperature and plasma power. By reducing the depositiontemperature more nitrogen is incorporated in the layer. When increasing the plasma power, more nitrogen becomes incorporated in triply coordinated form. (b)Temperature dependence of conductivity for different LiPON deposition conditions. A clear increase in conductivity is detected by reducing the temperature andincreasing the plasma power.

As expected, the charge discharge plot showsa constant voltage plateau is at 1.5V associated with Li-ion inser-tion/extraction in LTO. A capacity of 0.3 Ah/cm3 is reached in thisbattery cell. Note that this measurement shows that a 70 nm LiPONlayer is stable versus metallic lithium for prolonged time and the cellcould be cycled 50 times without showing lithium dendrite formation.During cell operation 30 nm of lithium metal is reversibly plated andstripped.AcknowledgmentsS.
