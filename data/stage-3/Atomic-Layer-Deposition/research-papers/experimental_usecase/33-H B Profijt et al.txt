Plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an energy-enhanced method for the synthesis of
ultra-thin ﬁlms with A˚-level resolution in which a plasma is employed during one step of the cyclic
deposition process. The use of plasma species as reactants allows for more freedom in processing
conditions and for a wider range of material properties compared with the conventional thermally-
driven ALD method. Due to the continuous miniaturization in the microelectronics industry and
the increasing relevance of ultra-thin ﬁlms in many other applications, the deposition method has
rapidly gained popularity in recent years, as is apparent from the increased number of articles
published on the topic and plasma-assisted ALD reactors installed. To address the main differences
between plasma-assisted ALD and thermal ALD, some basic aspects related to processing plasmas
are presented in this review article. The plasma species and their role in the surface chemistry are
addressed and different equipment conﬁgurations, including radical-enhanced ALD, direct plasma
ALD, and remote plasma ALD, are described. The beneﬁts and challenges provided by the use of a
plasma step are presented and it is shown that the use of a plasma leads to a wider choice in
material properties, substrate temperature, choice of precursors, and processing conditions, but that
the processing can also be compromised by reduced ﬁlm conformality and plasma damage.
Finally, several reported emerging applications of plasma-assisted ALD are reviewed. It is
expected that the merits offered by plasma-assisted ALD will further increase the interest of
equipment manufacturers for developing industrial-scale deposition conﬁgurations such that the
method will ﬁnd its use in several manufacturing applications.VC 2011 American Vacuum Society.

I. INTRODUCTION
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor-phase deposi-
tion technique in which ultra-thin ﬁlms are typically synthe-
sized sub-monolayer by sub-monolayer by repeating two
subsequently executed half-cycles.1–10 See Fig.1 for a sche-
matic illustration of an ALD cycle. ALD offers atomic layer
precision of the growth, because the reaction of the species
dosed during the two half-cycles is self-limiting. As a conse-
quence, when sufﬁcient precursor and reactant species are
dosed, the ALD ﬁlm growth is not ﬂux-dependent, as is the
case with deposition techniques such as chemical vapor dep-
osition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD). The
growth rate with respect to ALD is expressed as the growth
per cycle (GPC), which is typically in the range of 0.05–0.1
nm per cycle. In order to ensure that only ALD surface reac-
tions take place and not CVD-like reactions, which can
appear when precursor and reactant are present in the reactor
at the same time, a purge step is executed after each half-
cycle to remove the residual precursor or reactant species.
The total duration of a cycle is the sum of the precursor dos-
ing time, the precursor purge time, the reactant dose time
and the reactant purge time. Consequently, the duration of
one cycle cannot only be shortened by optimizing the dosing
times, but also by optimizing the purge times. During ALD,
the reactant is typically a gas, such as O2, or a vapor, such as
H2O, and the surface reactions are thermally-driven by
slightly elevated substrate temperatures (typically 150–350
/C14 C). Therefore, the method is also referred to asthermal
ALD. Besides the atomic control over the ﬁlm thickness, the
self-limiting half-cycles in ALD facilitate uniform deposi-
tion over large substrates and conformal deposition in struc-
tures of high aspect ratio, as long as the dosing and purge
times are sufﬁciently long.
The ﬁrst ALD research was conducted in the 1960s and
1970s in the former USSR and Finland, and the deposition
method was patented in 1977 by Suntola.11 For a more
extensive review on the history of ALD, the reader is
referred to Puurunenet al.7 In the mid-1990s, the semicon-
ductor industry became interested in ALD because a deposi-
tion method with atomic control over the ﬁlm thickness and
the ability to deposit ﬁlms conformally on nonplanar sub-
strates was needed. Since then, the semiconductor industry
has been the key driver of the ﬁeld of ALD.12 In 2007, Intel
introduced its ﬁrst 45 nm microprocessor containing Hf-

based gate dielectric layers fabricated by ALD. It is expected
that, starting from the 22 nm technology node, ALD will be
used in several key process steps.13,14
Plasma-assisted ALD is an energy-enhanced ALD
method that is rapidly gaining in popularity.15 In plasma-
assisted ALD, also referred to as plasma enhanced ALD
(PEALD), plasma ALD and, in some cases, radical-
enhanced ALD, the surface is exposed to the species gener-
ated by a plasma during the reactant step. This process is
also illustrated in Fig.1. Typical plasmas used during
plasma-assisted ALD are those generated in O2,N 2 and H2
reactant gases or combinations thereof. Such plasmas can
replace ligand-exchange reactions typical of H2Oo rN H3,
and they can be employed to deposit metal oxides, metal
nitrides and metal ﬁlms. Moreover, plasmas generated in
gases or vapors such as NH3 and H2O have been reported,
for which there can also be a combination of plasma and
thermal ALD surface reactions taking place at the same
time.
Plasma-assisted ALD offers several merits for the deposi-
tion of ultra-thin ﬁlms over thermal ALD and other vapor-
phase deposition techniques. The high reactivity of the
plasma species on the deposition surface during the plasma-
assisted ALD process allows for more freedom in processing
conditions and for a wider range of material properties.
These ideas will be addressed in detail later in this review ar-
ticle and are the primary reason why the interest in plasma-
assisted ALD has increased rapidly in recent years. This in-
terest has also been catalyzed by the many new applications
of ALD that are emerging in and outside the semiconductor
industry. Several non-semiconductor applications have set
new requirements for the ALD parameter space, which can-
not always be satisﬁed easily by a pure thermally-driven
ALD process.
The increasing popularity of plasma-assisted ALD is
manifested by the increasing number of recent publications
about the topic (see Fig.2), and the large set of thin ﬁlm
materials that have been synthesized by the method (see
TableI). Such is the interest and demand in the ﬁeld that the
number of ALD equipment manufacturers providing dedi-
cated plasma-assisted ALD tools has increased signiﬁcantly
in the recent years. Currently (status May 2011), companies
such as ASM (Emerald (2005) and Stellar (2006)),16 Oxford
Instruments (FlexAL (2006) and OpAL (2008)),17 Beneq
(TFS 200 (2009)),18 Cambridge NanoTech (Fiji (2009)),19
Applied Materials (Applied Endura iLB (2010)),20 Tokyo
Electron Limited (TELINDY PLUS IRad SA (2011)),21 and
Picosun (SUNALE (2011)) 22 provide tools for plasma-
assisted ALD.
The ﬁrst case of plasma-assisted ALD was reported in
1991, when De Keijser and Van Opdorp of the Philips
Research Laboratories in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, pub-
lished a paper on atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) of GaAs using
H radicals.111 The hydrogen radicals were generated in a
remote microwave-induced plasma and transported to the
deposition surface through a quartz tube (see Fig.3). The
atomic hydrogen was used to drive the surface reactions after
GaMe3 and AsH3 pulsing at substrate temperatures below
500 /C14 C, which is close to the onset temperature for the ther-
mal decomposition of GaMe3. Subsequently, the method
remained unexplored until the end of the 1990s, when the
semiconductor industry became interested in ALD as men-
tioned earlier. Sherman ﬁled a patent on the method in
1996,298 after which Rossnagel and co-workers reported on
plasma-assisted ALD of Ta and Ti metal ﬁlms in 2000.206 In
the latter case, the anticipated application of the technique
was the deposition of Cu diffusion barriers in advanced

interconnect technology, a ﬁeld already very familiar with
the merits and robustness of plasma-assisted processes
through the broadly-applied PVD technique of sputtering.
Afterwards, the number of materials, processes and applica-
tions of plasma-assisted ALD has diversiﬁed and grown
rapidly.
In this article, different plasma-assisted ALD conﬁgura-
tions will be described and the merits offered by the technique
will be discussed. Also, the challenges that plasma-assisted
ALD faces will be addressed, both in terms of limitations in-
herent to the use of a plasma-based process and in terms of
the scale-up of the technique for industrial applications. Sub-
sequently, the potential of plasma-assisted ALD will be illus-
trated by addressing some application areas of ultra-thin ﬁlms.
Next, an outlook will be given for the research and wide scale
applicability of the plasma-assisted ALD method. However,
to begin with, the next section will brieﬂy cover some plasma
basics for the typical plasma operating conditions employed
during plasma-assisted ALD.
II. PLASMA BASICS
A plasma is a collection of free, charged particles, among
other gas-phase species, which is, on average, electrically
neutral.299,300 This so-called quasi-neutrality means that at
macroscopic length scales (typically>1 mm) the electron
density is equal to the ion density, i.e.ne ¼ni, under the
assumption that negative ions can be neglected. In most
plasma conﬁgurations, plasmas are created by electrical
ﬁelds which lead to acceleration and heating of the electrons.
These hot electrons are able to ionize gas-phase species
through electron-induced collisions and, as such, they can
compensate for electron-loss collisions and consequently
sustain the plasma. Typically, the average electron tempera-
ture (a measure for the kinetic electron energy), Te,i s
/C24 3.5 /C2 104 K (approximately 3 eV) while the gas tempera-
ture remains low (Tgas ¼ 300–500 K). This results in non-
equilibrium conditions, caused by the relatively low gas
pressure that is typically employed in processing plasmas,

which, therefore, belong to the class of so-called “cold” plas-
mas. The electrons in the high-energy tail of the energy dis-
tribution are not only able to ionize species, but they can
also dissociate and excite the reactant gas through electron-
impact collisions. This leads to the formation of reactive atomic
and molecular neutrals (typically referred to as “plasma radi-
cals”), ions, and photons. Subsequently, these species can
undergo additional gas-phase reactions and they can induce sur-
face reactions when they arrive atdeposition or reactor surfaces.
Although the charged particles play a central role in sus-
taining the plasma, the fractional ionization or “ionization
degree” of processing plasmas is very low, typically within
the range 10/C0 6–10/C0 3. This means that the ﬂuxes of electrons
and ions to the deposition surface are much lower than the
ﬂux of the plasma radicals. Therefore, in many cases, the
surface chemistry is ruled by the interaction of the plasma
radicals with the surface species. However, the energy of the
ions, Eion, arriving at the surface can be much higher than
the ion or electron temperature, as ions are accelerated
within a thin positive space-charge layer, the “plasma
sheath,” at the boundary between the plasma and the sub-
strate. This plasma sheath develops because the electron
thermal velocity is much higher than the ion thermal veloc-
ity. To make the net current to the substrate zero, an electri-
cal ﬁeld develops between the plasma and the substrate,
which retards the electrons and accelerates the ions. There-
fore an electropositive plasma is (time-averaged) always at a
positive potential relative to any surface in contact with it. In
the rudimentary case of a ﬂoating substrate, the difference
between the plasma potential,Vp, and the substrate potential,
Vf, is generally given by
VP /C0 Vf ¼ Te
2e þ Te
2e ln mi
2pme
/C18/C19
;
where Te is the electron energy in eV, andme and mi are the
electron and ion mass, respectively. This means thatVp/C0 Vf
is typically a few multiples ofTe. The energy gained by the
ions in the plasma sheath, and consequently whether “ion
bombardment” can take place or not, also depends on the
collisional mean free path of the ions and the thickness of
the plasma sheath. At relatively low pressures, the ion mean
free path is larger than the plasma sheath thickness, such that
the ions can be accelerated over the full sheath (i.e. the
plasma sheath is collisionless) and consequently
Eion ¼ e(Vp/C0 Vf).
For typical processing plasmas, the potential over the
plasma sheath is<50 V, however, depending on the plasma
gas, the reactor geometry and substrate stage conﬁguration
(symmetry or asymmetry of the electrodes, grounding or
biasing of electrode/substrate stage, etc.), this potential can
also be as high as a few hundreds of Volts. Examples of
energy distributions for ions arriving at substrates for O2,
N2, and H2 plasmas under speciﬁc ALD conditions in a reac-
tor equipped with an inductively-coupled plasma are given
in Fig. 4. At higher pressures, however, the plasma sheath
becomes collisional and the net energy gained by the ions is
much smaller as a result. Also note that the ions in the
plasma sheath are accelerated in the direction perpendicular
to the (local) surface. This means that the ﬂux of the ions to
the surface is anisotropic with the ions having an angle of

substrate conditions (e.g. substrate temperature and substrate
materials). The reactivity of the plasma can also be
“selective” (e.g. in terms of reactive species produced) by
tuning its properties and composition by carefully choosing
the plasma operating conditions (gases, ﬂows, power, pres-
sure, etc.).
(2) Typically the plasma supplies a relatively low heat
ﬂux to the surface, despite its high reactivity. The reason is
that, for cold plasmas, only the electrons are heated signiﬁ-
cantly and not the other gas-phase species. Furthermore,
plasma exposure takes place only during a part of the cycle
(typically only for a few seconds) which does not allow the
plasma to extensively heat the substrate.
(3) Through ion bombardment, additional energy can be
provided to the deposition surface. This energy is locally dis-
sipated by the surface species and can enhance surface reac-
tion rates and processes such as surface diffusion. Possible
ion-surface interactions are depicted in Fig.5 for typical
ranges of ion energy and ion ﬂux towards the substrate, cor-
responding to various plasma-assisted techniques. Moreover,
the presence and level of ion bombardment can be controlled
through the plasma operating conditions (mainly the gas
pressure) as well as by the choice of plasma conﬁguration
and substrate (stage) conditions (e.g. grounded substrate,
stage size and substrate bias).
These key properties can be summarized by the phrase:
plasmas can deliver a high, diverse but selective reactivity to
a surface without heat, and can therefore access a parameter
space in materials processing, which is not easily accessible
with strictly chemical methods.299,300
Other key differences between plasma-assisted ALD and
thermal ALD include.
(1) Electron-impact collisions, as well as other reac-
tions, which lead to the excitation of atoms and mole-
cules. This excitation can be electronic for atoms and
electronic, vibrational, and rotational for molecules. When
electronically excited states return to the ground state,
they emit their energy as electromagnetic radiation, which
can be measured using optical emission spectroscopy
(OES).42,46,47,52,119,137,138,148,223,237,271,289,301–303 This exci-
tation process accounts for the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
to visible emission by the plasma as shown in the OES
spectra of O2,H 2, and N2 plasmas in Figs. 6(a)–6(c), for
example. The emission in the visible region gives the
plasma its characteristic color (as illustrated by the insets
of Figs. 6(a)–6(c)) and, therefore, its spectral ﬁngerprint

mator and the emission in the visible by a simple spectrometer (Refs.302,

insets show photographs of the corresponding plasmas.

can be easily used to extract information about the spe-
cies present in the plasma as well as about the chemical
and physical processes occurring both within the plasma
and at the surface. Measuring the visible emission of the
plasma also provides many opportunities for plasma-
assisted ALD in terms of process monitoring and optimi-
zation.302 The emission in the ultraviolet can, however,
also be sufﬁciently energetic to inﬂuence and induce
(unfavorable) processes at surfaces or within thin ﬁlms
(see Sec. V).303
(2) Creation of reactant species from the reactant gas dur-
ing the plasma step, which are mainly radicals. Apart from
the ALD surface reactions, these radicals can also undergo
additional reactions at the surface, even at saturated surface
sites. For example, radicals can recombine on wall (and dep-
osition) surfaces to form nonreactive molecules that desorb
back into the plasma. The probability of such recombination
reactions, the so-called surface recombination probability,r,
can be as small as 10/C0 6 and as high as 1 (see TableII).304
The value ofr has a direct impact on the density of the radi-
cals in the plasma as it deﬁnes the surface loss term for the
radicals. Moreover, a relatively highr can also signiﬁcantly
reduce the ﬂux of radicals in trenches or other high-aspect-
ratio features on the substrate, for which the radicals have to
undergo multiple wall collisions to reach deep inside the
structures (see Sec.V).
(3) The presence of a multitude of gas-phase and surface
species, which makes it not possible to identify single reac-
tant species solely responsible for the surface reactions. For
example, when admixing two reactant gases in the plasma,
new molecules (and related radicals) can be formed through
gas-phase or surface recombination reactions. 313 Further-
more, volatile products from the ALD reactions can be
excited, ionized and dissociated by the plasma when leaving
the surface. All of these species can contribute to the ALD
surface chemistry adding to its complexity.
To illustrate which species are typically present in a
plasma, including their typical density, an overview is given
in TableIII for an O2 plasma.314 Data are given for two oper-
ating pressures for an inductively-coupled plasma, as typi-
cally employed for remote plasma-assisted ALD described
in the next section.
III. PLASMA-ASSISTED ALD CONFIGURATIONS
Several equipment conﬁgurations exist for assisting an
ALD process by means of a plasma step.136
A. Radical-enhanced ALD
In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, a plasma generator is ﬁtted to a
thermal ALD reactor, see Fig.7(a). Examples of such plasma
sources are microwave surfatron systems100 and the radio-
frequency-driven R*Evolution (MKS Instruments) 315 and
Litmas RPS (Advanced Energy)316 systems, which are also
commonly used for plasma-based reactor cleaning. Due to
technical constraints on existing ALD reactors, plasma gen-
eration typically takes place at a relatively far distance from
ALD reaction zone. Consequently, the plasma species have
to ﬂow through the reactor tubing between the plasma source
and reaction chamber. This allows for many surface colli-
sions, where ions and electrons are lost before reaching the
substrate due to their recombination at surfaces. Therefore,
the method is typically referred to as “radical-enhanced
ALD”. The many surface collisions of the plasma species
can, however, also signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬂux of radicals
arriving at the substrate. This is especially prominent when
the choice of the inner surface of the tubing material is not
harmonized with the plasma radicals to reduce surface
recombination. For example, H radicals have a relatively
low surface recombination probability on quartz surfaces but
a very high recombination probability on most metals (see
Table II). In the case of metallic surfaces, very long radical
exposure times might be necessary to reach saturation of the
reactant step in the ALD cycle.
B. Direct plasma ALD
The second conﬁguration stems directly from the ﬁeld of
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). In
this case, a capacitively-coupled plasma is generated at radio
frequency, (RF, typically 13.56 MHz), between two parallel
electrodes in a so-called RF parallel plate or RF diode reac-
tor, see Fig.7(b). In this case, typically one electrode is pow-
ered while the other is grounded and, generally, the substrate
is positioned on the grounded electrode. As such, this ALD
reactor conﬁguration of is referred to as “direct plasma

ALD” because the wafer is directly positioned at one of the
electrodes which contribute to plasma generation. The gases
are introduced into the reactor either through a shower head
in the powered electrode228 or from the side of the electro-
des.199 The ﬁrst is typically referred to as “shower-head
type” and the second as “ﬂow-type” (if the pressure is sufﬁ-
ciently high). The ALD reactors provided by ASM (Emerald
and Stellar)16 and Beneq (TFS 200),18 for example, can be
classiﬁed as direct-plasma ALD reactors. Typical operating
pressures used during the plasma step in direct plasma ALD
are of the order of 1 Torr,200 although these also could be
<100 mTorr for an RF parallel plate reactor.25 During direct
plasma-assisted ALD, the ﬂuxes of plasma radicals and ions
towards the deposition surface can be very high, as the
plasma species are created in very close proximity of the
substrate surface. In principle, this enables uniform deposi-
tion over the full wafer area with short plasma exposure
steps. Because of the relatively simple reactor layout and
their proven performance in other plasma processing meth-
ods, direct plasmas are extensively used in industrial tools.
Depending on the voltage applied to the powered electrode
and the operating pressure, the energy of the ions arriving on
the substrate can, however, be substantial. In addition, the
emission of high energy photons can be signiﬁcant, possibly
leading to plasma damage. The extent of plasma induced
damage is, however, determined by the speciﬁc implementa-
tion of the plasma source and the processing conditions.
C. Remote plasma ALD
A third conﬁguration for plasma-assisted ALD equipment
can be classiﬁed as “remote plasma ALD.” In this case, as
its name implies, the plasma source is located remotely from
the substrate stage such that the substrate is not involved in
the generation of the plasma species, see Fig.7(c). This con-
ﬁguration can be distinguished from radical-enhanced ALD
by the fact that the plasma is still present above the deposi-
tion surface, i.e. the electron and ion densities have not
decreased to zero.237,303 The “downstream” plasma can be
of the afterglow type (where the local electron temperature
is too low to be ionizing) or can still be active (ionizing).
The ﬂux of the radicals towards the substrate can therefore
be much higher than for radical-enhanced ALD. Moreover,
under these circumstances, the plasma and substrate condi-
tions can be varied (relatively) independently of each other,
something which is not the case for direct plasma ALD. For
example, in direct plasma-assisted ALD a change in sub-
strate temperature affects the gas temperature and conse-
quently the density of gas-phase species and the generation
of plasma species.299 Therefore, the remote nature of the
remote plasma-assisted ALD conﬁguration allows for more
control of the plasma’s composition and properties than is
possible with direct-plasma ALD. The plasma properties can
be optimized relatively easily by tuning the operating condi-
tions of the plasma source and the downstream conditions at
the position of the substrate. This holds speciﬁcally for the
presence of ion bombardment and the inﬂuence of plasma
radiation.303 Due to their high degree of ﬂexibility remote
plasma ALD reactors are therefore well suited for process
design and other R&D applications.
A variety of plasma sources can be employed for remote
plasma-assisted ALD, including microwave plasmas, 111
electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasmas,152 and RF-
driven inductively-coupled plasmas (ICP). 206 The latter
type, either with a cylindrical or planar coil, is currently the

results described in Ref.314 for an inductively-coupled plasma operated at a source power of 500 W. The excited species O* and O2
* correspond to the lowest
metastable states being O (1D) and O2 (a 1Dg), respectively. Note that the calculated ion energy is lower than the measured ion energy reported on in Fig.4,
probably as a result of a different reactor geometry and capacitive-coupling of the plasma between the coil and the grounded reactor wall.

most popular and it has proven itself extensively as a plasma
source in plasma etching. In the Oxford Instruments FlexAL
and OpAL reactors,17 a multiturn cylindrical coil surrounds
an alumina discharge tube, while in the Cambridge Nano-
Tech Fiji system19 the inductor surrounds a quartz tube. The
operating pressure for these ICP systems can be as high as 1
Torr (Ref. 229) but, in many cases, pressures<100 mTorr
are common.206 For such low pressures, which are atypical
for (thermal) ALD, the reactors are equipped with turbomo-
lecular pumps. In remote plasma systems, the fact that the
plasma source and substrate surface are separated also
allows for easy use ofin situ diagnostic techniques such as
spectroscopic ellipsometry.238
An alternative approach is provided by Beneq in their
TFS 200 system.18 Although this is, in principle, a direct
ALD reactor employing a capacitively-coupled plasma, a
grid can be placed between the two electrodes creating a so-
called triode conﬁguration (see Fig.7(d)). This enables con-
ﬁnement of the plasma between the driven electrode and the
grid such that the deposition surface is not in contact with
the active plasma.62 In essence, this leads to a lower ion
energy and ﬂux towards the deposition surface, and lower
ion and photon ﬂuxes towards the deposition surface but also
to a somewhat reduced radical density.
D. Developments related to plasma-assisted ALD
reactors
Recently, there have been a number of other develop-
ments with respect to the aforementioned reactor conﬁgura-
tions. These initiatives mainly aim at obtaining additional
control over the production of plasma species and over their
interaction with the material surface. In the remote and
direct-plasma conﬁgurations discussed so far, the substrate is
generally placed on a grounded substrate stage. As a result,
the potential over the plasma sheath and, consequently, the
ion energy is relatively small. However, it is expected that
some deposition processes can beneﬁt from enhanced radical
production and/or from enhanced ion energies. In that case
the nongrounded substrate stage can be biased by a DC, AC,
RF, or pulse-shaped signal, or a combination of different sig-
nals.317 Such methods were inspired by conﬁgurations
designed for other plasma-assisted material processing tech-
niques such as plasma etching, ion implantation, and deposi-
tion by PECVD or PVD. 299 One conﬁguration recently
reported has a capacitively-coupled remote plasma (a direct
plasma with a grid), in which a pulsed dc power was applied
to the grid.138 It was reported that for the resulting negative
grid voltage, both the electron temperature and plasma den-
sity increased resulting in a higher radical and ion ﬂux to the
substrate. It was stated that this improved the electrical prop-
erties of HfO2 ﬁlms, such as the effective oxide thickness
and the breakdown voltage. Another embodiment is the
application of an RF bias or self-bias voltage to the substrate
stage in a remote plasma ICP reactor.318 Under properly cho-
sen operating conditions, this leads to an enhanced energy of
the ions impinging on the substrate, therefore yielding an
additional control over the plasma-surface interaction in
which the ion energy can be independently controlled from
the ion and radical ﬂux. It is expected that more results from
these and other similar approaches will appear in the litera-
ture relatively soon.
IV. MERITS OF PLASMA-ASSISTED ALD
The use of plasma-assisted ALD for ultra-thin ﬁlm synthe-
sis has several potential advantages, in addition to the beneﬁts
provided by the ALD technique itself. These merits can be
useful for speciﬁc applications of ALD-synthesized thin ﬁlms.
A. Improved material properties
It has been reported that, for some materials and ap-
plications, plasma-assisted ALD affords better mate-
rial properties than thermal ALD in terms of, for example,
ﬁlm density, 166,167,187,207,214,227,228 impurity con-
tent,120,162,229,241,245,271,290,294 and electronic proper-
ties.30,31,50,68,134,135,154,207,208,211,228,229,242,272,290,294,319 In
most cases, these improved material properties are a result
of the high reactivity provided by the plasma, which will be
addressed in more detail below. However, more speciﬁcally,
this improvement can often be attributed to kinetically
driven, selective ALD surface reactions, for example, the
abstraction of surface halogen atoms by H radicals and
several ion-assisted surface reactions, as illustrated in Fig.5.
B. Deposition at reduced substrate temperatures
As high reactivity is delivered to the deposition surface
by the plasma species, less thermal energy is required at the
substrate to drive the ALD surface chemistry. This means
that it is possible to deposit ﬁlms with equivalent material
properties at lower substrate temperatures than for thermal
ALD.40,56,65,87,187,233,243,249,254,320 The reactivity delivered
by the plasma species is not only provided by reactive
plasma radicals but is also determined by the kinetic energy
of the ions accelerated in the plasma sheath, the surface-
recombination energy of the ions and other species, and the
energy ﬂux caused by the plasma radiation.
C. Increased choice of precursors and materials
The fact that reactive plasma radicals are delivered to the
deposition surface allows for the use of precursors with rela-
tively high thermal and chemical stabilities. A classic example
is the ALD of metal oxides fromb-diketonate precursors, such
as those with acac (acetylacetonate),97–100 hfac (1,1,1,5,5,5-hex-
aﬂuoroacetylacetonate),101,161,162 and thd (2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-
3,5-heptanedionato)102,104,275–279 ligands. Such precursors
require more reactive co-reactants as they show no or low reac-
tivity with H2O (in essence, they do not readily undergo hydro-
lysis reactions). Although the use of O3 could also provide a
solution in such cases, plasma-assisted ALD processes can give
even more reactivity. The plasma-assisted method can also yield
solutions when depositing non-oxidic materials such as metal
nitrides and metals. In addition to a wider choice of precursors,
plasma-assisted ALD processes also enable the deposition of
more material systems, for example, of the elemental metals Ti

a n dT a( s e ea l s oS e c .VI A).204–206,232 For these metals, no
(thermal ALD) reactant is available to reduce the precursor.
Furthermore, plasma-assisted ALD allows for a wider choice of
substrate materials to be used, particularly those which are tem-
perature-sensitive.35,38,39,54,65,163,187,251,252,256,258,286,320,321
D. Good control of stoichiometry and film
composition
Non-thermally-driven reactions can be induced at the
deposition surface due to the nonequilibrium conditions in
the plasma, which enables better control of the ALD surface
chemistry and of the species incorporated into the ﬁlm.
Therefore, the use of a plasma provides additional variables
with which to tune the stoichiometry and composition of the
ﬁlms. These include the operating pressure,205,225,245 plasma
power,52,62,70,151,152,167,183,213,214,233 plasma exposure
time,164,183,213,214,221,222,228,236,237,245 the admixing of addi-
tional gases into the plasma,30,74,215,218 and the biasing volt-
age.138,318 It is, for example, relatively straightforward to
incorporate N atoms into oxide thin ﬁlms by the addition of
N2 to a plasma generated in O2.38,73,128,134,143,146,319 Such
controlled doping of thin ﬁlm materials is difﬁcult to achieve
with strictly thermally-driven ALD reactions.
E. Increased growth rate
Cases exist in which the plasma species create a higher
density of reactive surface sites due to the high reactivity of
the plasma. Consequently, this can lead to higher growth per
cycle values.31,32,40,58,60,134,154,187,207,208,229,233,254,259,261,274,294
Moreover, the plasma can be switched on and off very rapidly,
which enables fast pulsing of the plasma reactant spe-
cies255,273,274,293,295 and reduced purge times (depending on
the gas residence time in the reactor).46,60 The latter is espe-
cially important for the ALD of metal oxides at low tempera-
tures (room temperature up to 150/C14 C), where purging of H2O,
in the case of thermal ALD, requires excessively long purge
times and, therefore, long cycle times.322 Shorter cycle times
have a signiﬁcant impact on the net throughput of an ALD
reactor. The high plasma reactivity is also beneﬁcial in par-
ticular cases where the nucleation delay is shorter for
plasma-assisted ALD than for the equivalent thermal ALD
process.31,164,166,168,169,173,179,183 This aspect also contributes
to an increased throughput of ALD reactors.
F. More processing versatility in general
The availability of a plasma source on an ALD reactor
allows for several otherin situ treatments of the deposition
surface, deposited ﬁlms, and reactor walls. Plasmas can be
used for substrate pretreatment (e.g. oxidation by an O2
plasma69,70,119,122,130,132,149 and nitridation by NH3 or N2
plasmas119,129,132), substrate cleaning, 98 post-deposition
treatments,141,164 and reactor wall conditioning and clean-
ing.240 For example, a layer of TiN covering the walls of the
reactor can be removed easily by running a F-based plasma
such as one generated in NF3 or SF6.136
The aforementioned merits of plasma-assisted ALD can
be illustrated in more detail by several results that have
been reported for various material systems in the recent
years.
The ﬁrst example is the remote plasma-assisted ALD of
Al2O3 from AlMe3 and an O2 plasma, which can be com-
pared to the thermal ALD case with H2O. For both ALD
processes, the dominant reaction products during the precur-
sor dosing step are CH4 molecules. During the subsequent
reactant step, however, different reaction products are pro-
duced for the thermal and plasma process. For thermal ALD,
only CH4 is created, whereas for plasma-assisted ALD,
combustion-like reactions take place which result in the pro-
duction of CO2 and H2O. In the case where only monofunc-
tional chemisorpion of AlMe3 to the surface is assumed, the
suggested dominant surface reactions for plasma-assisted
ALD can be written as46,47,55
1: AlOHðadsÞ þ AlMe3ðgÞ ! AlOAlMe2ðadsÞ þCH4ðgÞ;
2: AlMeðadsÞ þ4O ðgÞ ! AlOHðadsÞ þCO2ðgÞ þ H2OðgÞ:
The process and material properties of Al2O3 ﬁlms deposited
by plasma-assisted ALD were compared directly with those
for thermal ALD. The results in Fig.8 show that the Al2O3
ﬁlms can be deposited by plasma-assisted ALD at substrate
temperatures between 25 and 400/C14 C. Data are provided for
processes carried out in two ALD reactors,323 which differ in
operating pressure by a factor of/C24 10. It is clear that the
GPC (growth per cycle) shows no dependence on the plasma
operating pressure in this case.323 It can also be observed
that the GPC increases proportionally with decreasing sub-
strate temperature. Although this effect can partly be attrib-
uted to a slightly reduced mass density of the ﬁlms for
temperatures below 150/C14 C, the change in GPC is predomi-
nantly caused by an increased incorporation of Al atoms into
the ﬁlm per cycle at lower substrate temperatures.56 This
number of Al atoms incorporated is related to a higher
FIG. 8. (Color online) Growth per cycle of Al2O3 ﬁlms as a function of the
substrate temperature. The ﬁlms were deposited by plasma-assisted ALD
(O2 plasma) and thermal ALD (H2O). Two different ALD reactors were
used; one operating at 15 mTorr and the other at 170 mTorr (Refs.43, 323).

surface density of hydroxyl groups at lower substrate tem-
peratures. This has been conﬁrmed byin situ infrared spec-
troscopy, which revealed that hydroxyl groups on Al2O3
surfaces are the dominant adsorption sites for AlMe3 during
plasma-assisted ALD.55 For the thermal ALD process of
AlMe3 and H2O, the GPC values are comparable but slightly
lower than for plasma-assisted ALD at temperatures>200
/C14 C. However, it is at temperatures<200 /C14 C that the main
difference is observed, because here the GPC of thermal
ALD drops signiﬁcantly below that for plasma-assisted
ALD. The thermal, energy at these temperatures is insufﬁ-
cient to allow for a full reaction of H2O with the surface and
so, in this case, high hydroxyl surface density cannot be cre-
ated. Additionally for the thermal ALD process, the purge
after the H2O dose needs to be increased at low substrate
temperatures to avoid parasitic CVD reactions. For tempera-
tures >200 /C14 C, purge times well below 5 s are sufﬁcient
(optimized industrial ALD reactors even use sub-second
purges), whereas at 58 /C14 C, 30 s is required to completely
remove residual water.322 At room temperature, Al2O3 ﬁlms
can still be synthesized by thermal ALD, but the purge time
required becomes impractically long (up to 180 s at 33/C14 C).
For plasma-assisted ALD, the purge time can be kept rela-
tively short, even at room temperature, in essence, equal to the
time used at higher temperatures or only slightly extended.60
The structural properties of Al2O3 thin ﬁlms are highly compa-
rable for both thermal and plasma-assisted ALD using AlMe3
as a precursor.60,323 At lower substrate temperatures the ﬁlm
quality degrades slightly, as evidenced by a reduced mass den-
sity, an increased O/Al ratio, and a higher H concentration.60
Furthermore, small traces of C can be found in the ﬁlms de-
posited at room temperature. For plasma-assisted ALD the C
atoms are mainly incorporated as COx groups, the density of
w h i c hc a nb er e d u c e db yi n c r e a s i n gt h ep l a s m ae x p o s u r e
time.55 Despite the somewhat lower material quality of the
Al2O3 deposited at substrate temperatures <150 /C14 C, these
ﬁlms are considered very attractive for applications which
require dense, amorphous and conformal Al2O3 ﬁlms depos-
ited at low temperatures. Examples are given in Sec.VI.
The plasma-assisted ALD of TiO2 ﬁlms from metal-or-
ganic precursors and an O2 plasma is another case for which
the merits of the plasma-based process can be illustrated. As
shown in Fig. 9, TiO2 has also been deposited at low
substrate temperatures by this method, using Ti(O iPr)4,
Ti(CpMe)(OiPr)3, Ti(Cp*)(OMe)3, and Ti(CpMe)(NMe2)3 as
precursors. The ﬁlms have been deposited at substrate tem-
peratures as low as 25, 50, 100, and 100/C14 C, respectively.56
Moreover, the GPC values were marginally affected by the
substrate temperature over the full temperature range (up to
300 /C14 C). For thermal ALD, with either H2Oo rO3, the situa-
tion is quite different.324,325 Firstly, the GPC increases with
substrate temperature, which indicates that the surface reac-
tions are rate-limited by thermal activation. This holds for
Ti(OiPr)4 with both H2O and O3 (see Fig. 9), but also for
Ti(Cp*)(OMe)3 with O3 (not shown).326 Furthermore, for all
these precursors, the GPC for the thermal process is lower
than that for plasma-assisted ALD (except for the case of
Ti(OiPr)4 with O3 at 300 /C14 C, where the high GPC has been
attributed to thermal decomposition of the precursor 324).
This clearly demonstrates that an O2 plasma is not only more
reactive than H2O but is also more effective than O3, particu-
larly at lower temperatures. In addition, O2 plasmas (and O3)
allow for the use of Cp-based Ti precursors, which show
almost no reactivity against H2O in ALD processes.326 This
exempliﬁes the fact that a wider range of precursors can be
employed for use with plasma-assisted ALD. These rela-
tively stable Cp-based precursors are currently of substantial
interest for metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor applica-
tions. In such capacitors the use of SrTiO3 is being consid-
ered as an ultra-high- k dielectric, e.g. in upcoming
technology nodes of DRAM devices. SrTiO3 can be depos-
ited by the combination of TiO2 and SrO ALD cycles into
so-called “supercycles” for which an overlap in temperature
window of the two ALD processes is demanded. In order to
obtain SrTiO3 dielectric ﬁlms with the best electrical per-
formance, the highest possible deposition temperature within
the shared temperature window should be chosen.195,327
The fact that plasma-assisted ALD can lead to improved
material properties has also been demonstrated by results on
metallic TiN ﬁlms.233,237 The combination of TiCl4 with an
H2/N2 plasma yielded thin TiN ﬁlms with an excellent resis-
tivity and low impurity levels. These results greatly surpass
the material quality achieved with the standard thermal pro-
cess employing TiCl4 and NH3.233,237 Alternatively, during a
thermal ALD process also dimethyl hydrazine (N2H2Me2)o r
hydrazine (N2H4) can be used as reactants. These reactants
are, however, less common and the results obtained so far
are not as good as obtained with a H2/N2 plasma.
During a plasma-assisted ALD cycle of TiN, the simpli-
ﬁed surface reaction scheme can be described as
FIG. 9. (Color online) Growth per cycle of TiO2 ﬁlms as a function of the
substrate temperature. Plasma-assisted ALD was carried out using Ti(OiPr)4,
Ti(CpMe)(OiPr)3, Ti(Cp*)(OMe)3, and Ti(CpMe)(NMe2)3 as precursors in
combination with an O2 plasma (Refs.56, 248). Data for thermal ALD with
H2O (Ref.325) and O3 (Ref. 324) using the widely employed Ti(OiPr)4 pre-
cursor are given for comparison. From S.E. Pottset al., J. Electrochem. Soc.

In terms of acceptable material quality, thermal ALD of TiN
is limited to the substrate temperature range of 300–400/C14 C,
while the plasma-assisted ALD process can yield fair mate-
rial properties down to temperatures as low as 100/C14 Ca s
shown in Fig.10. For thicker ﬁlms, resistivity values as low
as 72 mX cm (400 /C14 C) and 209mX cm (100 /C14 C) have been
reported, which could be attributed to the low Cl concentra-
tions of 0.1 and 2.1 at.%, respectively at these tempera-
tures.237 This is quite a promising achievement, since TiN
has numerous applications, such as an electrode material in
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors and as a metal gate
in CMOS devices.328
The ability of plasma-assisted ALD to synthesize materi-
als which cannot (or hardly) be deposited by thermal ALD is
exempliﬁed by the case of TaNx. Thermal ALD processes
using either metal halide or metal-organic precursors in com-
bination with NH3 always yield the highly resistive Ta3N5
phase because the reducing power of NH3 is insufﬁcient to
reduce the Ta oxidation state fromþ 5t oþ3.329 Cubic TaN,
can be deposited by thermal ALD when N2H4 is used as the
reactant330 or with the help of additional reducing agents
such as AlMe3 or elemental Zn.329,331 However, these proc-
esses employ relatively uncommon reactant gases or addi-
tional reducing agent dosing steps, which add signiﬁcantly
more complexity to the deposition process. For plasma ALD
processes, it is possible to deposit conductive cubic TaN
ﬁlms from metal-organic precursors using an H 2
plasma.223,226 This is illustrated in Fig.11, where the resis-
tivity of TaN ﬁlms, deposited using Ta(NMe2)5 as a precur-
sor, as a function of the H2 plasma exposure time is shown.
It is clear that TaN ﬁlms with resistivity values as low as 380
mX cm could be obtained for long plasma exposure times. In
addition, the aforementioned highly resistive Ta3N5 ﬁlms
can also be synthesized by plasma-assisted ALD using the
same Ta(NMe2)5 precursor, either by admixing a small con-
centration of N2 into the H2 plasma or by operating the
plasma in NH3.223 This process also exempliﬁes that plasma-
assisted ALD offers good control over the ﬁlm
stoichiometry.
As another example, the ALD of metal ﬁlms is consid-
ered, in particular the ALD of Pt. Materials from the Pt-
metal group, with applications in nanoelectronics (as electro-
des) and in catalysis, are among the exceptional cases of ele-
mental metals for which thermal ALD is relatively
straightforward.332 Pt can, for example, be deposited by ther-
mal ALD using Pt(CpMe)Me3 as a precursor combined with
O2 gas.333 Assuming that analogous surface reactions to
those reported for the thermal ALD process of Pt take
place,334 it is likely that a reaction mechanism such as the
following occurs in the case of plasma-assisted ALD:

For ALD of Pt as well as for many other noble metal proc-
esses, a relatively long nucleation delay can occur on oxides
and other starting surfaces, which is especially prominent
when lower operating pressures are employed. However, this
nucleation delay can be almost completely eliminated when
an O2 plasma is used instead of O2 gas,164 as shown in Fig.
12. The plasma-assisted step makes the ALD process and
thickness control more reliable, while also reducing the con-
sumption of an expensive Pt precursor. Furthermore, when a

(seed) layer of Pt has been deposited by plasma-assisted
ALD, the thermal process can be continued without disrup-
tion in the thickness increment per cycle (see Fig.12).
Another interesting feature of the plasma-assisted ALD pro-
cess is that PtO2 ﬁlms can also be deposited using the same
precursor and an O2 plasma, the only difference (compared
to the plasma-assisted ALD of Pt) being the plasma exposure
time. Pt can be deposited using short plasma exposure times,
whereas relatively long plasma exposure times yield PtO2.
For the process reported in Fig.12, these exposure times are
0.5 and 5.0 s, respectively. The GPC for PtO2 is very similar
to that for Pt (see Fig.12) even though the number of Pt
atoms per cycle is lower. So far the only thermal ALD pro-
cess for PtOx that has been reported was based on a combina-
tion of Pt(acac)2 and O3, and was restricted to the small
temperature window of 120–130/C14 C.335
Another material from the Pt-group for which the nuclea-
tion delay can be reduced by the plasma-assisted process is
Ru. Results obtained using Ru(CpEt)2 as a precursor and a
NH3 plasma as the reactant, for example, are reported in the
literature quite extensively.165–176 Pure and smooth ﬁlms
with a low resistivity were deposited with substrate-depend-
ent growth rates and nucleation delays (/C24 20 cycles for TiN
and almost none for SiO2). NH3 gas is not reactive with the
precursor and the thermal ALD process does not result in
ﬁlm growth. However, O2 gas can be used for thermal ALD
of Ru and results in growth rates that are up to 4 times higher
compared to the plasma-assisted ALD process with NH3
plasma as the reactant.166,173 Ru ﬁlms were also deposited
by employing O2 gas and an O2 plasma as the reactant in
deposition processes using RuCp(CO) 2Et.179 These proc-
esses revealed fairly high growth rates of/C24 1 nm/cycle after
nucleation delay of/C24 45 and/C24 85 cycles for plasma-assisted
ALD and thermal ALD, respectively. The surface rough-
nesses were, however, somewhat higher than for the NH3
plasma process. Besides the nucleation properties and the
growth rate, the choice of the reactant can also depend on
the other layers in the structure; O2 gas or an O2 plasma can
oxidize a surface whereas the use a NH3 plasma could lead
to reduction and even nitridation of the surface.175
V. CHALLENGES OF PLASMA-ASSISTED ALD
Although plasma-assisted ALD can offer several beneﬁts
over thermal ALD for selected applications, the method also
faces a number of challenges when compared to its thermal
counterpart.
One limitation of plasma-assisted ALD that is often high-
lighted is thereduced conformalityor step coveragethat can
be achieved on nonplanar substrates. These can be substrates
with surface structures of high aspect ratio (e.g. wafers with
trenches or vias) or substrate materials with very high sur-
face areas (e.g. porous materials and stacked particles). Ther-
mal ALD is known to be the method of choice for depositing
conformal thin ﬁlms on such substrates, as ﬁlm growth is
self-limiting and independent of the precursor ﬂux when the
conditions are such that saturation of the ALD (half-) reac-
tions is reached. The difference between plasma-assisted and
thermal ALD, in this respect, is that plasma-assisted ALD
involves reactive species that not only undergo ALD reac-
tions (as in thermal ALD) but can also react on saturated sur-
face sites. As mentioned in Sec.II, radicals from the plasma
can react with other radicals and species residing at the sur-
face, forming nonreactive molecules that desorb back into
the plasma. In the case of high-aspect-ratio structures or po-
rous materials, the radicals have to undergo several surface
collisions in order to reach deep inside the surface features,
which signiﬁcantly reduces the local ﬂux of the radicals due
to the surface recombination. This has only recently been
addressed qualitatively by simulations and experimen-
tally.42,304,336,337 In many other reports, the impact of the
surface recombination of plasma radicals is generalized and
the poor conformality of plasma-assisted ALD ﬁlms is often
claimed. However, the conformality achieved by plasma-
assisted ALD under certain conditions depends strongly on
the value of the recombination probability,r, which itself
depends on (a) the type of radicals responsible for ﬁlm
growth in a certain plasma-assisted ALD process and (b) the
material being deposited (see TableII). Note that the surface
temperature can also affect the value ofr, for example, a sig-
niﬁcant temperature dependence was reported for oxygen
radicals on silica,305 whereas the temperature dependence of
H radicals on metals was less prominent.306 The inﬂuence of
the value ofr can be illustrated by the results obtained from
simple two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, in which
the evolution of the deposition proﬁle within a trench of high
aspect ratio was studied as a function of the incoming radical
ﬂux.304,337 This was achieved by considering only the
plasma exposure step during a single ALD cycle. The infor-
mation on the deposition proﬁle at the side wall of the trench
was derived from the number of ALD growth events as a
FIG. 12. (Color online) Thickness evolution of Pt and PtO2 ﬁlms deposited
on an Al2O3 substrate (Ref.164). The precursor was Pt(CpMe )Me3 and O2
gas or an O2 plasma were used as the oxidants. After 150 cycles, the
plasma-assisted ALD process was stopped and ﬁlm growth was continued
using thermal ALD. The plasma exposure time for was 0.5 s for Pt and 5 s
for PtO2. From H.C.M. Knoopset al., Electrochem. Solid-State Lett.12,

function of the side wall position. Forr > 0, it was found
that the deposition proﬁles showed a minimum thickness at
the region just above the bottom of the trench (see Fig.
13(a)) and this minimum was more pronounced for larger
values ofr. The deposition proﬁles were clearly distinguish-
able from the cases in which the conformality was reaction-
limited or diffusion-limited (see Fig.13(a)).338 Therefore, in
addition to these limiting cases (which are also observed for
thermal ALD) a new recombination-limited regime was dis-
tinguished for the case of plasma-assisted ALD.304 In order
to achieve conformal deposition while in this recombination-
limited regime, a longer plasma exposure time has to be
employed. Compared to the case where r ¼ 0, the dose
required for saturation increases considerably when increas-
ing the value ofr, especially for high aspect ratios. The latter
is illustrated in Fig.13(b) for aspect ratios of 10 and 30 and
for r values ranging from 0.01 to 0.3. The “sticking” proba-
bility of the radicals on unreacted surface sites was assumed
to be 0.01. From the ﬁgure it is clear that for the smallerr
values and reasonable aspect ratios (/C20 10), conformal deposi-
tion can still be achieved relatively easily by increasing the
plasma exposure time by, for example, up to 10 times longer
than that required for a planar substrate. However, for very
high aspect ratios (e.g./C21 30) plasma exposure times are nec-
essary that are practically unfeasible. Consequently, because
most current applications have reasonable aspect ratios, it
can be concluded that in many practical cases, conformal
deposition in high-aspect-ratio structures can certainly be
achieved by plasma-assisted ALD. This is also conﬁrmed by
the results obtained for several metal oxides where ther val-
ues of oxygen radicals are known to be relatively
low.60,199,200,210,246,339,340 For other cases, such as metals,
the r values of radicals are relatively high. This makes it
very difﬁcult or even impossible to achieve a good confor-
mality, especially for aspect ratios>10. Finally, it should be
noted that thermal ALD processes can also be subject to sur-
face recombination losses of reactant species. For example,
for some materials, O3 also has considerable (nonzero)r val-
ues, which generally increase with surface tempera-
ture.341,342 In this case, conformal ﬁlm growth might also be
recombination-limited.304,341
A second limitation of plasma-assisted ALD that can
have an important effect on certain applications can be
described asplasma-induced damage. During the plasma
step of the ALD cycle, the deposition surface is exposed to a
multitude of reactive species from the plasma that can also
induce undesired surface reactions, including oxidation and
nitridation of the top surface layers of the substrate.27,62,175
In the case of (enhanced) surface oxidation, the interaction
of oxygen atoms with the substrate during the initial ALD
cycles can result in a (thicker) interfacial oxide, for example,
when metal oxides are deposited on silicon (see also Sec.
VI B).343 Nitridation can take place when using N2-o rN H3-
based plasmas to deposit metal nitrides.238 Note that nitrida-
tion is often also employed on purpose, for example, to
increase the stability or the relative permittivity (k-value) of
oxides.32,91,119,129,143,209 Plasma-induced damage can also
manifest itself by the formation of defects inside the material
or at the surface onto which the ﬁlm is deposited. The bom-
bardment of the substrate by energetic ions, accelerated in
the plasma sheath, can lead to bond-breaking, displacement
of atoms in the surface region and charge accumulation on
dielectric layers.344,345 Such ion bombardment effects are
particularly important during plasma-activated processes,
such as reactive ion etching, where the substrate is nega-
tively biased to give the incoming ions kinetic energies of up
to several hundreds of eV. 299,300 During plasma-assisted
ALD the ion energies are typically much lower due to
grounding of the substrate stage and/or the high pressures
employed (i.e., when the plasma sheath is collisional), mean-
ing that they are typically below the damage threshold (e.g.
the atom displacement threshold) and cannot cause

signiﬁcant defect creation. However, there is still a signiﬁ-
cant possibility that ion bombardment may be of inﬂuence
because the performance of most semiconductor devices, in
which the ultra-thin ALD-synthesized ﬁlms are employed, is
strongly affected by their interface properties. The inﬂuence
of ion bombardment was illustrated by a study in which the
material properties of HfO2 ﬁlms deposited in a remote
plasma and a direct plasma reactor were compared.124,125
The ﬁlms deposited in the remote plasma reactor were amor-
phous, but showed better interface properties than the poly-
crystalline HfO2 ﬁlms deposited in the direct plasma reactor
(also see Sec. VIb). Consequently, the electrical properties
of the ﬁlms, such as dielectric constant, ﬁxed oxide charge
density, and carrier mobility were superior for the remote
plasma case. As exempliﬁed by this study, the inﬂuence of
plasma damage is more likely when the ﬂux of ions is con-
siderable, such as in direct plasma-assisted ALD. Another
often neglected, but in many cases even more important,
mechanism is defect creation by plasma radiation. As men-
tioned earlier, a signiﬁcant amount of ultraviolet (UV) radia-
tion is formed in plasmas, the energy of which can reach up
to 10 eV (see Fig.6). Oxides, such as SiO2 as well as the
high-k oxides, have band gap values smaller than 9 eV,
meaning that vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation can create
defects, for example, by photoemission or photoinjection of
charge. Plasma-induced defect creation has been studied in
great detail for the plasma processing of SiO2-based gate
stacks299,300,346–349 and the inﬂuence of VUV exposure has
also recently been studied for the high- k oxide
HfO2.299,300,344,350–352 However, this damage mechanism
has not really been highlighted for plasma-assisted ALD
processes, for example, during the synthesis of metal oxides
by plasma-assisted ALD itself or when depositing other
materials (such as electrode materials) on top of high- k
oxides by plasma-assisted ALD. Note that, apart from the
fact that the metal oxide ﬁlm might itself be affected, the
interfacial SiOx layer, which is typically present (either unin-
tentionally or prepared on purpose) between the metal oxide
and the Si substrate, can also be affected. From experiments
(see Fig. 14(a)), it has recently been demonstrated that the
surface passivation of crystalline Si by as-deposited Al2O3 is
strongly affected by defects generated by VUV photons
from the O2 plasma (photon energy of 9.5 eV, see Fig.
6).43,303 To illustrate that VUV radiation is responsible for
the degradation in surface passivation, a silicon wafer coated
with thermal ALD-deposited Al2O3 (30 nm in thickness)
was exposed to an O2 plasma through 5.0 mm quartz and
MgF2 windows covering the sample which would either
block or transmit the 9.5 eV photons, respectively. The
results, which are presented in Fig.14(b), demonstrate that
no degradation in lifetime is observed when the VUV radia-
tion was blocked by the quartz window. However, for the ex-
posure through the MgF2 window, the lifetime degraded
with a rate equal to that obtained when no window was used
(after correcting for the /C24 60% transmittance of the MgF2
window at 130.5 nm wavelength). The photons emitted by
the O2 plasma during plasma-assisted ALD induce a very
high interface defect density (Dit /C25 1012 eV/C0 1 cm/C0 2 at the
midgap) such that extremely high surface recombination
velocities of 10 7 cm/s were obtained. 43 However, most
of these surface defects can be removed by annealing the
ﬁlms for 10 min at 400/C14 Ci nN2 (Dit reduced to/C24 1011 eV/C0 1
cm/C0 2), such that excellent surface recombination velocities,
as low as 1 cm/s, can be achieved on low-resistivity ﬂoat-
zone Si. These surface recombination velocities correspond to
a surface passivation quality not yet paralleled by any other
material.323 On the other hand, as-deposited Al2O3 synthe-
sized by thermal ALD affords reasonably low surface recom-
bination velocities, as the ﬁlms are not exposed to VUV
radiation from a plasma (despite this fact, the level of surface
passivation after annealing is not as good as for Al2O3 synthe-
sized with by plasma-assisted ALD).43 Furthermore, it has
been demonstrated that the level of surface passivation by as-
deposited Al2O3 synthesized by plasma-assisted ALD can be
increased by decreasing the length of the plasma exposure
FIG. 14. (Color online) Experiments proving that VUV radiation from the

posited by plasma-assisted ALD (Refs.43, 303). After annealing, the wafers
were exposed to an O2 plasma for various exposure times. (a) The effective
charge carrier lifetimes degraded for increasing exposure times at a rate
which increased with increasing VUV radiation present in the plasma
(higher intensity for higher power and/or lower pressure). (b) Results are
also given for the situation in which the substrate is covered by quartz and
MgF2 windows that respectively block and do not block the VUV photons
of 9.5 eV. From H.B. Proﬁjtet al., ECS Trans.33, 61 (2010). Reproduced

step, in this case, by using slightly sub-saturated ALD
conditions.43
The aforementioned challenges for plasma-assisted ALD
are inherent to the plasma-surface interaction that takes place
during the plasma step. To assess their possible impact on
the potential applications of the plasma-assisted ALD
method, a deeper investigation of the underlying surface
processes, including the plasma-surface interaction, is
required in order to establish whether they lead to problems
for the speciﬁc applications considered. Another class of
challenges is related to the development of equipment and
theindustrial scale-up of the process. The use of plasma
steps during ALD cycles requires more complex equipment
than that used for thermal ALD. Unless this additional com-
plexity is compensated for by the signiﬁcant advantages of
plasma-assisted ALD, thermal ALD will be the method of
choice. For research and development (R&D), the interest in
plasma-assisted ALD equipment is hardly or not affected, as
R&D equipment is required to directly compare the results
obtained by plasma and thermal ALD. This is evidenced by
the fact that several combined plasma and thermal ALD
tools have recently been introduced onto the market. How-
ever, for industrial scale-up the situation is different. Here,
plasma-assisted ALD will only be adopted when it provides
major beneﬁts over thermal ALD and when alternative depo-
sition techniques are not available for the speciﬁc applica-
tions envisioned. The latter situation is currently prominent
in the ﬁeld of crystalline silicon photovoltaics, where mainly
thermal ALD is currently considered by equipment manufac-
turers for the scale-up of Al2O3 deposition,18,353–355 despite
the fact that plasma-assisted ALD can provide signiﬁcant
beneﬁts over thermal ALD in this case.356
VI. SELECTED APPLICATIONS
In the literature a number of applications have been sug-
gested for thin ﬁlms synthesized by plasma-assisted ALD. In
the semiconductor industry these applications vary from the
so-called “back-end-of-line,” the level in IC fabrication
where individual device components are interconnected, to
the so-called “front-end-of-line,” the level where the individ-
ual device components are created in and on the silicon sub-
strate. Over the past few years, the application of the ﬁlms as
barrier and protective layers has gained signiﬁcant interest.
A. Back-end-of-line processing
Although the ﬁrst time that a plasma was used in an ALD
process dates back to 1991, the research on plasma-assisted
ALD primarily started around 2000, when major thin ﬁlm
challenges in the back-end-of-line processing were foreseen.
At that time, the replacement of Al by Cu as the interconnect
material was imminent and plasma-assisted ALD processes
for the deposition of Ta and Ti liners were developed.206
Such liner materials became necessary to prevent Cu diffu-
sion into the low-k dielectric and to promote the adhesion of
Cu to the diffusion barrier layer.357 For this application, typi-
cally a stack of materials, such as TaN/Ta or TiN/Ti, needs
to be employed and these materials need to be deposited in
the trenches and vias before ﬁlling them with Cu. Therefore,
in addition to the good barrier and adhesion properties, other
requirements for the liner materials include a high confor-
mality of the ﬁlms in nanoscale structures, a deposition
temperature compatible with back-end-of-line processing
(/C20 400 /C14 C), as well as a high chemical and thermal stability.
Also the resistivity should be low to keep the total resistance
of the interconnects as low as possible and to allow for metal
layers to be connected through the barrier layers. In particu-
lar cases, a low-resistivity barrier and adhesion layer could
also simultaneously act as a seed-layer for the electrochemi-
cal deposition process of Cu.161,166,180–183,220,240
Triggered by these challenges, Rossnagel and co-workers
at IBM developed plasma-assisted ALD processes of Ta and
Ti using the metal halides TaCl5 and TiCl4 as precursors
and an H2 plasma as a reducing agent.206 As mentioned in
Sec. IV, no thermal ALD processes exist for these metals,
but the deposition of Ta and Ti ﬁlms by plasma-assisted
ALD was successful (see Fig.15). As a follow-up of this
work, the IBM group, as well as others, also developed
plasma-assisted ALD processes for other liner materials,
including the metal-nitrides TaN and TiN. The development
of these processes was intended to facilitate the switching
from metal halide precursors to metal-organic precursors
(e.g. Ta(NMe2)5, Ta(NtBu)(NEt2)3, Ti(NMe2)4 to name a
few) due to compatibility issues of the former, caused by
halide impurities in the ﬁlms. The plasmas employed were
typically generated in H2,H 2/N2 and NH3. Research on a
combined Cu diffusion barrier and Cu seed layer triggered
the development of plasma-assisted processes of refractory
metals, most prominently Ru, e.g. from Ru(CpEt)2 as the pre-
cursor and an NH3 plasma as the reactant.165–174 A compre-
hensive overview of the metal and metal nitride ﬁlms
deposited by (plasma-assisted) ALD for Cu interconnect
applications can be found in the review paper by Kim.328
FIG. 15. Surface coverage of Ti atoms as a function of the number of ALD
cycles, as measured by a quartz crystal microbalance at room temperature
(Ref. 232). The precursor employed was TiCl4 and the reactant was an H2
plasma. For deposition on the as-received crystal, the growth showed a lin-
ear trend after /C24 5 cycles. Reprinted with permission from H. Kimet al.,

The suitability of plasma-assisted ALD-deposited Ta,
TaN, Ti, and TiN ﬁlms as diffusion barriers was investigated
and reported in a number of articles.175,204,219,222,225,226 In
an early report, Kimet al.demonstrated that the barrier ﬁlms
should preferably be amorphous, in order to avoid Cu leak-
age along the grain boundaries.226,357 They demonstrated
that plasma-assisted ALD Ta ﬁlms showed superior Cu dif-
fusion barrier properties compared to their PVD counterpart,
especially for thicknesses below 10 nm, due to the amor-
phous structure of the ﬁlms.204 For TaN ﬁlms deposited by
plasma-assisted ALD and PVD, a similar performance was
found with both materials basically showing the same barrier
failure temperatures as a function of thickness.219 These
results are summarized in Fig.16. For a process involving
the metal-organic precursor Ta(NMe2)5 and a N2 plasma, it
was demonstrated that TaN ﬁlms of only 0.6 nm thick pos-
sessed a barrier failure temperature of>800 /C14 C.226 This tem-
perature is one of the higher values reported with the
enhancement in diffusion barrier properties being mostly
attributed to an increased nitrogen content in the ﬁlm.
Another interesting issue addressed by Kimet al. is the
fact that the barrier material should not penetrate into the po-
rous low-k dielectric layer. Therefore, penetration of TaN
during deposition with thermal and plasma-assisted ALD
using Ta(NMe2)5 as the precursor and NH3 or an H2/N2
plasma as reactants was investigated.357 For the thermal
ALD case, the TaN layer penetrated the porous dielectric
material as both the precursor as the reactant species were
able to enter the pores and participate in the ALD growth
process. However, for the plasma-assisted case, no evidence
of ﬁlm growth was found deep in the pores. While the pre-
cursor is able to travel a signiﬁcant distance into the pores,
the plasma radicals cannot, as they will eventually recom-
bine after undergoing several surface collisions.357
Despite these efforts in the early 2000s, the interest and
research on plasma-assisted (and thermal) ALD on liner
materials declined after several years. The reason was that
continuous improvements in PVD technology for Cu inter-
connects, for example by advances in ionized PVD, reduced
the need for the adaption of a completely new ﬁlm technol-
ogy in the back-end-of-line processing. However, the
research on ALD materials for back-end-of-line processing
is currently increasing again, as it is inevitable that new thin
ﬁlm technologies will need to be implemented to deal with
the challenges presented by future technology nodes.13,357
B. Front-end-of-line processing
High-k dielectric layers
Since the advent of Moore’s law, the downscaling of
CMOS transistors requires a continuous decrease in the thick-
ness of the gate dielectric. By the end of the 1990s, it was real-
ized that the required thickness of the standard SiO2 layer
would eventually be too thin to prevent large leakage cur-
rents.358 This led to an increase in interest, within the semicon-
ductor industry, in ALD of dielectric thin ﬁlms as a viable
alternative to growing SiO2 by thermal oxidation. It resulted in
the screening of all kinds of high-k dielectrics, especially HfO2
and ZrO2, and associated ALD processes to ﬁnd a material
with a physically higher thickness but a lower equivalent oxide
thickness (EOT). Eventually it led to the implementation of Hf-
based oxides deposited by ALD in the 45 nm technology node
in 2007.12,359 In addition to thermal ALD processes, it also
resulted in many investigationsof plasma-assisted ALD proc-
esses for high-k oxides, again putting a considerable effort into
HfO2 and related oxides. For example, Parket al.demonstrated
that a plasma step can be beneﬁcial as it can result in HfO2
ﬁlms with a higher density, a lower impurity level and a higher
interface quality.135 The ﬁlms were deposited from
Hf(NEtMe)4 with an O2 plasma as the reactant. Compared to
thermally-deposited layers, the interface layer was thicker (2.0
nm versus 1.5 nm), but because it consisted of Hf–Si–O mixed
with SiO2, the total ﬁlm had a higherk-value than the thermal
ALD layer with a SiO2 interface layer. Moreover, the leakage
current density of the plasma deposited samples was three
times lower than that for the thermally-deposited samples, but
the ﬁxed oxide charge density was higher.
The fact that the availability of a plasma source also
offers the possibility of using plasmasin situbefore, during
or after deposition was also exploited. In a number of stud-
ies, it was demonstrated that a thin SiO2 layer grown by an
O2 plasma pretreatment can retard the formation of a Hf-sili-
cate interface layer, resulting in ﬁlms with improvedk-val-
ues and related electrical properties.122,130,132 The use of a
CF4 plasma for 60 s was also proven to be beneﬁcial prior to
the deposition process.141 Maeng et al. reported interface
defect passivation by Si–F bonds resulting in a decrease in
the ﬂatband voltage and a lower leakage current density. The
deposition of HfO2 on a 1.0 nm thick plasma-nitrided HfO2
or Al2O3 layer was found to result in a thinner interfacial
layer, a lower EOT, a lower leakage current density, and a
reduced charge defect density.129
Exploring variations in plasma composition, Lee et al.
reported a lower ﬁxed oxide charge density for HfO2 when
FIG. 16. Barrier failure temperatures for TaN and Ta ﬁlms deposited by
PVD and plasma-assisted ALD (Refs.204, 219). After deposition the TaN
and Ta layers were capped by 200 nm thick Cu ﬁlms using the PVD tech-
nique. Barrier failure temperatures were determined by monitoring the dis-
appearance of the Cu (111) peak by X-ray diffraction measurements. The
ALD ﬁlms were deposited using an H2/N2 plasma for TaN and an H2 plasma
for Ta. From H. Kimet al., J. Appl. Phys.95, 5848 (2004). Reprinted with

using a N2O plasma instead of an O2 plasma.134 Maeng et al.
observed a slightly higher ﬁxed oxide charge density and
interface state charge density when using a N 2/O2
plasma.134,140 It was also shown that the use of a N 2O
plasma resulted in randomly oriented polycrystalline ﬁlms,
instead of amorphous ﬁlms obtained with N2O gas. Also, the
growth per cycle was higher.134 Maeng et al. also reported
two different experiments in which a HfOxNy layer was
incorporated within an HfO2 ﬁlm by varying the plasma
composition during the ALD process.116,143 In this case the
precursor was Hf(NMe2)4, whereas the reactant was varied
from an O2 plasma to an H2 plasma or an O2/N2 plasma. The
ﬁlms possessed a higher k-value, a lower interface defect
density Dit and a lower or comparable leakage current den-
sity. The latter was attributed to the presence of N–H bonds,
which block leakage paths and suppress conduction band
lowering and reduce trap sites.116 Besides the plasma com-
position, the reactor choice can also inﬂuence the material
properties, as already mentioned in Sec.V. Kim et al.
reported polycrystalline HfO 2 ﬁlms deposited from
Hf(NEt2)4 and an O2 plasma in a direct plasma reactor com-
pared to amorphous ﬁlms obtained with the same ALD
chemistry in a remote plasma (See Fig.17).123,125 In addition
to better dielectric properties, MOSFET devices that were
prepared using remote-plasma ALD HfO2 showed better
interface properties and a lower ﬁxed oxide charge density.
The difference in material properties was attributed to the
increased physical reactivity of the direct plasma, in terms of
ion bombardment (see Sec.V). On the other hand, a beneﬁ-
cial effect of some (mild) ion bombardment was also demon-
strated in a recent study. HfO2 was deposited using
Hf(NEtMe)4 and an O2 plasma in a capacitively-coupled
remote plasma reactor (see Sec. III) in which the grid
between the driven electrode and the substrate carrier was bi-
ased. Films deposited with a 30 W bias power resulted in
ﬁlms with a lower EOT and a higher breakdown electric ﬁeld
than those in an unbiased situation.138
Although the plasma-assisted ALD processes to Hf-based
and the many other high-k oxides investigated are currently
not considered for adaptation into process ﬂows for
advanced gate stacks, there are still many research efforts on
plasma-assisted ALD of high- k oxides ongoing. Several
other applications also exist for which high- k and other
oxides deposited by plasma-assisted ALD are interesting
candidates. In particular, the manufacture of high-density
capacitors, for which ultrahigh-k oxides (e.g. SrTiO3 (Refs.
195–198)) are being considered,327 might require energy-
enhanced ALD processes as certain classes of precursors do
not react with H2O under ALD conditions (see Sec.IV).360
Spacer-defined double patterning
As discussed in the previous sections, plasma-assisted
ALD is generally able to deposit thin ﬁlms at lower tempera-
tures than thermal ALD. In several cases, ﬁlms of reasonably
high quality can even be deposited at temperatures of 100/C14 C
and lower. This merit of plasma-assisted ALD has recently
led to a development of high interest to the semiconductor
industry. In order to keep up with the future demands of min-
iaturization, extreme-UV lithography (13.5 nm wavelength)
is being developed. However, methods such as double
exposure and double patterning361,362 are being adopted in
the interim to extend the versatility of current lithography
methods (193 nm wavelength) while still allowing for
smaller structures to be deﬁned. Recently an alternative form
of double patterning, requiring only one lithography step
instead of two, has been developed. This spaced-deﬁned
double-patterning method, which is currently being intro-
duced in DRAM manufacturing for the fabrication of the
next generation of logic devices, employs a low temperature
plasma-assisted ALD step.13,321,363
In spacer-deﬁned double patterning, a photoresist layer is
deposited and patterned on top of the target layer, as shown
in Fig.18. Then, a highly conformal SiO2 spacer layer is de-
posited directly onto the photoresist pattern. This requires a
low temperature plasma-assisted ALD process, as the photo-
resist is temperature-sensitive. Next, the structure is aniso-
tropically etched and the photoresist is removed, resulting in
a patterned layer with narrow spacer features. These then
function as a mask for the second anisotropic etching step, in
which the pattern is transferred to the target layer. Finally,
the SiO2 masking material can be removed. Obviously, the
deposition of /C24 20 nm thick SiO 2 layers with excellent
uniformity and deposition temperatures<100 /C14 C is key in
this process. Plasma-assisted ALD is well-suited for this
application and is, therefore, an enabling technology for the
FIG. 17. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of as-grown HfO2 ﬁlms deposited by (a) remote-plasma ALD
and (b) direct-plasma ALD (Refs.124, 125). The ﬁlms were deposited on Si at a deposition temperature of 250/C14 C using Hf(NEt2)4 as the precursor and an O2
plasma as the reactant. A gradual transition from the interface layer to the HfO2 layer can be observed for the remote-plasma ALD ﬁlm, whereas the ﬁlm de-
posited using a direct-plasma shows an abrupt transition. The ﬁlm deposited using a direct-plasma was partially crystallized, whereas using a remote plasma
afforded an amorphous ﬁlm. From J. Kimet al., Appl. Phys. Lett.87, 53108 (2005). Reprinted with permission. Copyright 2005, American Institute of

spacer-deﬁned double patterning method. Several low-
temperature plasma-assisted ALD processes of SiO2 have
recently been reported.184,186,187 In the literature, a success-
ful spacer-deﬁned double patterning process was demon-
strated for 32 nm half-pitch polysilicon lines.321 It has also
been reported that predeposition plasma treatments are use-
ful for further widening of the space between lines and/or to
reform the resist shape. Spacer-deﬁned double patterning
does not suffer from overlay issues, which is common for
the double exposure technique. High throughputs can be
achieved in mini-batch systems which are essentially multi-
single-wafer systems.13
C. Encapsulation
Another promising application of plasma-assisted ALD
processes is the encapsulation of polymeric and/or organic
devices by thin ﬁlms. It has been demonstrated that metal
oxide ﬁlms (e.g. Al2O3 and TiO2) prepared by plasma-
assisted ALD can serve as good barrier layers against H2O
and O2 permeation.38,39,54,251,256 For Al2O3 it was reported
that the material can provide very low water vapor transmis-
sion rates for the encapsulation of organic LEDs while also
signiﬁcantly reducing the pinhole density.38,39,54 The advant-
age of ALD processes for this application is that dense, high
quality thin ﬁlms can be prepared that outperform ﬁlms pre-
pared by other vapor phase deposition methods (such as
PECVD and PVD) even when those layers are much
thicker.54,364,365 The main advantage of the plasma-based
process is that short cycle times can be maintained at low
substrate temperatures, including room temperature. More-
over, Langereis et al. reported the striking result that, for
Al2O3 ﬁlms deposited by remote plasma-assisted ALD, the
best barrier performance was obtained for ﬁlms deposited at
room temperature (see Fig.19).54
A related application of low temperature ALD-synthe-
sized ﬁlms is the protection of high-precision and high-pu-
rity metal parts against corrosion by water (liquid or vapor),
acidic, basic or saline solutions, or organic solvents.366–369
For this application, ultra-thin, dense, and defect-free coat-
ings are also desired and, in most cases, they need to be de-
posited at reduced substrate temperatures to maintain the
mechanical properties of the substrates and to reduce the
possibility of premature surface oxidation. Al2O3 is again
among the most important candidate materials, although for
the ﬁnal application a stack of materials might be required.
A recent study revealed that plasma-assisted ALD with an
O2 plasma produced Al2O3 encapsulation layers that showed
a better ﬁlm nucleation and lower porosity than ﬁlms depos-
ited by thermal ALD using H2O vapor.65 For this applica-
tion, but also for the application of Al2O3 as an H2O and O2
barrier, the advantage of plasma-assisted ALD over thermal
ALD was most prominent for the thinnest ﬁlms (/C24 10 nm)
deposited at room temperature. Considering the growing im-
portance of thin ﬁlm encapsulation and the increasing num-
ber of applications of temperature sensitive materials,

layer to be patterned) and patterned by UV exposure and photoresist development. In the next step (b) a SiO2 spacer layer is deposited at a low temperature
using plasma-assisted ALD, after which an anisotropic etch is carried out. Subsequently, the photoresist is removed in step (d) after which the pattern can be
transferred into the target layer. Finally, in step (f) the SiO2 spacers are removed, after which narrow features at half-pitch are left. Between steps (a) and (b),
an optional plasma-treatment can be carried out in order to additionally reduce the feature thickness of the photo resist. In (g) a scanning-electronmicroscopy
image is shown, illustrating a photoresist pattern covered by a conformal SiO2 spacer layer (corresponding to the situation in (b)). Courtesy of ASM Interna-
tional N.V.

plasma-assisted ALD has the potential to become a promi-
nent technology in this ﬁeld.
VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND OUTLOOK
With the growing need for high quality ultra-thin and
conformal ﬁlms, in and outside the semiconductor industry,
the number of applications of ALD will grow substantially
in the next decade. As a consequence, the requirements on
process conditions and material properties will increase and
diversify, requiring new experimental approaches and a vari-
ety of ALD equipment conﬁgurations. As plasma-assisted
ALD can provide some unique merits over the thermal ALD
method, it is expected that the interest in this method will
also keep growing considerably. This increase in interest is
already currently manifested by the number of ALD equip-
ment manufacturers providing dedicated plasma-assisted
ALD tools, which has increased signiﬁcantly in the last few
years. The demand for plasma-assisted ALD equipment
from industrial R&D laboratories has, in particular, appeared
to be high. It is likely that this is fueled by the fact that
industrial laboratories are particularly focused on equipment
that provides a high degree of ﬂexibility in combination with
a robustness of the equipment and processes. In this respect,
plasma-based techniques have been well-accepted in thin
ﬁlm and device manufacturing. Nevertheless, plasma-
assisted ALD also faces several challenges. In order to
address the question whether and when aspects inherent to
the plasma-based process will provide principal limitations
for certain applications, a deeper understanding of ﬁlm
growth by plasma-assisted ALD is required. Therefore, more
insight into the underlying surface reactions and the role of
the plasma-surface interaction needs to be obtained. This is
quite a challenging task, but, consequently, also an appealing
one considering the complexity of plasma processes. Also of
vital importance is that plasma-assisted ALD equipment for
high volume manufacturing will be developed and imple-
mented. In the case where (multiple) single wafer reactors
are used, the implementation of a plasma source is relatively
easy.13 Recently, however, the ﬁrst results were presented on
plasma-assisted ALD an inline spatial ALD system66 while
also the ﬁrst results obtained in a multiwafer ALD batch re-
actor equipped with plasma source were presented.370 Fur-
thermore, in 2007 a patent was ﬁled on roll-to-roll ALD
using an atmospheric plasma371 by FujiFilm Manufacturing
Europe.372 Generally for plasma-assisted ALD, it would be
best to focus initially on applications for which no alterna-
tive deposition techniques exist, or on applications for which
the merits of plasma-assisted ALD are substantial and criti-
cal. Once established, the method will certainly ﬁnd more
applications and plasma-assisted ALD will complement
existing thin ﬁlm manufacturing techniques.
