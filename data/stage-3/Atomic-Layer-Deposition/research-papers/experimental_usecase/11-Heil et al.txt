Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven,The NetherlandsReceived 14 November 2007; accepted 17 March 2008; published online 19 May 2008Plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition ALD of metal oxide films is increasingly gaining interest,however, the underlying reaction mechanisms have rarely been addressed. In this work, a case studyis presented for the plasma-assisted ALD process of Al2O3 based on AlCH33 dosing and O2plasma exposure. A complementary set of time-resolved in situ diagnostics was employed, includingspectroscopic ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance, mass spectrometry, and optical emissionspectroscopy. The saturation of the AlCH33 adsorption reactions was investigated, as well as thereaction products created during both the precursor dosing and the plasma exposure step. Thegenerality of the observations was cross-checked on a second commercial ALD reactor. The mainobservations are as follows: i during the precursor dosing, the AlCH33 predominantly bindsbifunctionally to the surface at 70 °C through a reaction in which H is abstracted from the surfaceand CH4 is released into the gas phase; ii during the plasma exposure, O radicals in the plasma areconsumed at the surface by combustionlike reactions with the surface ?CH3 ligands, producingmainly H2O, CO2, and CO; iii small gas phase densities of CH4 and higher hydrocarbons C2Hxare also present during the O2 plasma exposure step indicating complementary surface reactionsincluding a secondary thermal ALD-like reaction by the H2O produced at the surface; iv theplasma and its optical emission are strongly affected by the surface reaction products released in theplasma. In the latter respect, optical emission spectroscopy proved to be a valuable tool to study thesurface reaction products during the plasma exposure as well as the saturation of the surfacereactions. The implications of the experimental observations are addressed and it is discussed thatthe reaction mechanisms are generic for plasma-assisted ALD processes based on metal organicprecursors and O2 plasma as oxidant source. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.DOI: 10.1063/1.2924406I. INTRODUCTIONThe synthesis of very thin metal oxide films by atomiclayer deposition ALD is currently a very active researchfield. Investigations into various metal oxide materials forapplications in semiconductor devices such as gate oxide incomplementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor gate stacks andas dielectric layer in dynamic-random-access-memory de-vices had led to a rapid increase in the number of ALDprocesses developed. In many of the metal oxide ALD pro-cesses metal organic precursors are employed and H2O isused as oxidant.1 However, since recently, ALD processes inwhich O3 or an O2 plasma is used as an alternative oxidantsource are gaining increasingly more attention. In these latterprocesses the oxidant is more reactive than H2O and, there-fore, the surface reactions rely less on thermal activation bythe substrate temperature. For example, when an O2 plasmais used, chemical activation of the oxidant has already oc-curred in the gas phase and, therefore, the use of a lowerdeposition temperature is in many cases facilitated. Further-more, for some materials it has been reported that improvedfilm properties are obtained when using O3 or O2 plasmainstead of H2O.28 The potentially more favorable processsettings e.g., in terms of substrate temperature and purgetimes as well as the potentially improved material propertiesobtained for the O3 and O2 plasma based ALD processeshave also contributed to an increased interest into ALD byother fields of technology than semiconductor industry. Po-tential application of ALD films in areas such as microsys-tems, solar cells, flexible electronics, energy storage, andphotonics have recently been reported.919While the material properties and functionality of thefilms have already been investigated in relative detail, thereaction mechanisms leading to film growth in the O3 and O2plasma based ALD processes have hardly been addressed.Very recently, however, theoretical and experimental investi-gations of the reaction mechanism of Al2O3 ALD fromAlCH33 trimethylaluminum TMA precursor and O3were reported by Elliott et al.20 and Goldstein and George.21Our research group recently published a first study about thereaction mechanism of plasma-assisted ALD of Al2O3 usingAlCH33 and O2 plasma.22 The current article is a follow upon this earlier work and a more extended study of theplasma-assisted ALD process of Al2O3 will be presented.Due to its excellent dielectric properties, its good adhe-sion to many surfaces, and its high thermal and chemicalstability, Al2O3 is a very relevant material for a wide rangeaElectronic mail: s.b.s.heil@tue.nl.bAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Furthermore, the thermal ALD process ofAl2O3 using AlCH33 and H2O is considered to be a modelsystem for ALD film growth of metal oxides.1 The ALDreaction mechanisms during the AlCH33 and the H2O stephave been thoroughly investigated both experimentally andtheoretically.2331 From these investigations, it has been es-tablished that Al2O3 growth by thermal ALD occurs via thefollowing successive half-reactions:32AlOHs + AlCH33g ? AlOAlCH32s + CH4g, 1Al  CH3s + H2Og ? AlOHs + CH4g, 2where s and g represent surface groups and gas species,respectively. The chemisorption of AlCH33 and H2O on thesurface is a Lewis acid-base reaction in which methyl ligandsCH3? and hydroxyl protons H+ combine in a Brønstedacid-base reaction and are eliminated as CH4.20,28,29,33 ForAl2O3 as well as for some other metal oxides, the amount ofmaterial deposited per cycle was found to directly relate withthe substrate temperature dependent OH density on thesurface.34,35For the plasma-assisted ALD process of Al2O3 based onAlCH33 dosing and O2 plasma exposure, we recently pre-sented compelling evidence that the AlCH33 chemisorptionstep appears very similar as in the thermal ALD process withH2O.22 Nonetheless, the oxidation step by the O2 plasmaappeared to be very different from the H2O based process. Itwas demonstrated that combustionlike reactions by theplasma generated O radicals removed the ?CH3 ligands fromthe surface because combustion products such as CO2 andH2O were detected by mass spectrometry.22 Furthermore, asmall signal due to the presence of CH4 during the plasmaexposure step indicated that the formed H2O byproduct in-duces a secondary thermal ALD-like reaction pathway. Pre-viously such secondary reaction pathway, in which the reac-tion products of the oxidation step play a role in the surfacechemistry, was speculated upon.2,36 In this article we presentcorroborating evidence and additional details that support thepreviously proposed reaction mechanism. A more extensiveand complementary data set is reported as obtained by acombination of several in situ diagnostics such as spectro-scopic ellipsometry SE, quartz crystal microbalanceQCM measurements, quadrupole mass spectrometryQMS, and optical emission spectroscopy OES. More spe-cifically, extensive data on the saturation of the AlCH33chemisorption reaction are presented. The previous observa-tions are also corroborated by an additional data set obtainedon a commercial 200 mm ALD reactor Oxford InstrumentsFlexAL. More insight into several aspects of the reactionmechanism of plasma-assisted ALD of Al2O3 has been ob-tained: QMS signals for mass-to-charge ratios of m /z=2430 suggest the presence of small amounts of C2Hx dur-ing the plasma exposure, in addition to the earlier detectedpresence of H2O, CO2, CO, and CH4.22 By OES with anextended wavelength range in the UV, the presence of OH*emission was also identified during the plasma step. Further-more, it has been demonstrated that the saturation conditionsfor Al2O3 film growth can be determined not only directlyvia the use of film growth monitoring techniques, such asspectroscopic ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance,but also indirectly by gas phase diagnostics, such as OES andQMS. On the basis of the results reported a more completepicture of the reaction mechanisms during plasma-assistedALD of Al2O3 will be presented. Finally, from this casestudy of Al2O3, the implications for plasma-assisted ALD ofother metal oxide films grown from metal organic precursorsand O2 plasma will be briefly discussed.II. EXPERIMENTALA. ALD-I reactor1. Reactor setupMost of the experiments were carried out on a homebuiltremote plasma ALD reactor referred to as ALD-I, which isschematically represented in Fig. 1a. The reactor has beendescribed in detail in our previous work with respect to thedeposition of TiN and TaN films using a N2H2 plasma.37,38Briefly, it consists of a remotely placed inductively coupledplasma source which is powered at a radiofrequency of13.56 MHz and at a power of 100 W. For Al2O3 depositionthe source is operated on O2 gas purity 99.999%. Theplasma source is connected to a wall heated depositionchamber where substrates can be placed on a individuallyheated stainless steel substrate holder. AlCH33 Akzo No-FIG. 1.

It should be noted that AlCH33 forms adimeric molecule in the liquid phase and in the gas phase atlow temperatures through a bridged structure via the methylgroups.39,40 At temperatures 70 °C and at low pressuresthe AlCH33 is predominantly in the monomer phase.412. Pulsing of the reactantsA schematic of the ALD cycle used in these experimentsis shown in Fig. 1b. A continuous flow of O2 through theplasma source served both as plasma gas and as a purge gas.Since AlCH33 and O2 do not react in the gas phase22,42,43 itcan be introduced into the O2 background. The amount ofprecursor dosed per cycle was set by the number of succes-sive, small AlCH33 exposures introduced into the reactorthrough alternatively evacuating 1 s and refilling 1 s thesmall trapped volume in the precursor delivery line. After apurging period, an O2 plasma exposure was applied for anumber of seconds by turning on the rf power. In the currentinvestigation the implemented purge times were set such toallow for a complementary study by all diagnostics. Duringthe cycle the pressure in the reactor was approximately con-stant at 7.5 mTorr. The deposition temperature was set to70 °C by wall heating of the reactor.3. In situ diagnosticsFor in situ film measurements, a rotating compensatorSE J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000U with a wavelength range of2451000 nm was mounted on the reactor. The angle of in-cidence on the substrates was 68° with the substrate normal.SE data were typically measured after every ten completedAl2O3 ALD cycles. Crystalline silicon c-Si was used assubstrate material, which was either plasma oxidized for5 min prior to deposition or contained a 400 nm thick ther-mal SiO2 layer on top. The thickness of the Al2O3 was de-termined by fitting the SE data with a Cauchy model usingthe Woollam WVASE software. The value of the refractiveindex at a photon energy of 2 eV ranged typically between1.60 and 1.65 for the Al2O3 films investigated by SE.Film growth was also monitored by a QCM. Gold cov-ered AT-cut quartz crystals with an oscillation frequency of6 MHz were mounted in a Maxtek 150BSH bakeable crystalholder positioned in close proximity to the substrate holderand with the crystal surface facing down i.e., not facing theplasma source. The crystals were first coated with a freshplasma-assisted ALD Al2O3 film before taking any filmgrowth data. The QCM signal was monitored using a MaxtekTM400 thickness monitor which was interfaced with a com-puter at a data acquisition rate of 10 Hz. The extremely highsensitivity of the QCM to surface temperature fluctuations onthe crystal progresses with temperature and, consequently, acareful interpretation of the measured signal is required.44,45This high sensitivity of the QCM is the reason for controllingthe temperature at 70 °C by uniform wall heating in thisparticular experiment, as described above. In addition, pres-sure variations in the reactor were adequately minimized bycontinuously flowing the O2 gas. The QCM results are ex-pressed in terms of mass gain with the unit hertz.46The gas composition was measured by a differentiallypumped QMS Pfeifer QME 200, mass-to-charge ratio m /z=0100 fitted at the side of the reactor. The gas samplingtook place through a 150 m diameter pinhole keeping thepressure in the mass spectrometer within the working range10?5 Torr for the secondary electron multiplier to oper-ate. The electron impact ionization by 70 eV electrons inthe mass spectrometer leads to fragmentation or crackingof incoming gas species. The identification of the parent mol-ecules was therefore performed on the basis of its so-calledcracking pattern. The cracking pattern of some moleculesCO, CO2, and AlCH33 was measured specifically for ourQMS by introducing calibration gases yielding good agree-ment with data reported in the literature. To achieve suffi-cient time resolution, time-resolved measurements were car-ried out by monitoring only two mass-to-charge ratios m /zat a time with an integration time of 10 ms. One of the twomasses selected served as a reference signal, while the othermass in the range of m /z=1075 was varied over severalruns. In the current measurements m /z=32 O2+ was takenas reference as there is a continuous flow of O2 into thereactor. Data are typically taken over ten ALD cycles, and onthe basis of the m /z=32 O2+ signal the measurements weresynchronized afterwards. This procedure allowed for con-structing a time-resolved mass scan of several masses withan adequate time resolution.OES measurements were carried out by measuring theplasma emission just above the substrate holder using anOcean Optics USB2000 spectrometer having a wavelengthdetection range of 250870 nm and a spectral resolution ofapproximately 1 nm. The emission by the plasma wascoupled into the spectrometer by placing an optical fiber witha small aperture 100 m diameter close to one of thequartz windows on the main chamber. Time dependent mea-surements were carried out by repetitively acquiring fullspectra 250870 nm with an integration time of 100 ms.The option in the software for selecting emission peaks inthe spectrum and measuring the signal height as a function oftime was also used to monitor excited plasma species duringthe plasma exposure step.B. FlexAL reactorA similar, but less extensive in situ study of the Al2O3process was carried out in the commercial 200 mm FlexALreactor from Oxford Instruments. Both the FlexAL reactoritself and the characteristics of the deposition process ofAl2O3 by remote plasma ALD using this reactor have beendescribed in our previous work.3,47 One main difference withthe experiments carried out on the homebuilt ALD-I reactordescribed above is the method of precursor dosing. In theFlexAL a single dose is injected into the deposition chamberusing a fast open-close 20 ms Swagelok ALD valve posi-tioned in the precursor delivery line. In all experiments anopen-close time of 20 ms was used for AlCH33 dosingleading to saturated ALD reactions for Al2O3. Furthermore, a103302-3 Heil et al. J. Appl. Phys. 103, 103302 2008Downloaded 27 Jun 2008 to 131.155.108.71. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jap.aip.org/jap/copyright.jspcontinuous O2 flow of 60 SCCM SCCM denotes cubic cen-timeter per minute at STP was applied through the plasmasource and the pressure in the reactor was kept constant at15 mTorr. The intermitting purge time between precursorand plasma was 3 s, the plasma exposure was set to 4 s, andthe purge between plasma and precursor was 0.5 s. Both thereactor walls and the substrate holder were not heated andremained at a temperature of approximately 25 °C.Similar to the ALD-I setup, the FlexAL was equippedwith a spectroscopic ellipsometer, a mass spectrometer, andoptical emission spectroscopy. The SE configuration wassimilar to the ALD-I.3 The mass spectrometer QMS, PfeiferQME 200, m /z=0200 was differentially pumped and theonly difference with the ALD-I setup is that this mass spec-trometer has an extended mass-to-charge m /z range andconsequently a higher signal-to-noise ratio, especially form /z ratios 40. Optical emission spectroscopy was per-formed using the same equipment as for the ALD-I. Theplasma emission was collected through a quartz window atthe top of the plasma source probing the emission from boththe plasma source region and the downstream reactor regionby line-of-sight measurement. This configuration was chosenbecause probing the emission downstream from the side ofthe reactor lead to a poor signal-to-noise-ratio at the hightime resolution 100 ms desired. The data analysis of thein situ diagnostics on the FlexAL reactor was identical to thedata analysis on the ALD-I reactor.III. RESULTSA. In situ thickness monitoring by SEIn our previous work, it was established that in situ spec-troscopic ellipsometry is a valuable tool to monitor ALD filmgrowth.3,38,48 In the current work the plasma-assisted ALDprocess of Al2O3 was characterized at substrate temperaturesof 70 and 200 °C. Figure 2 shows the results obtained for aplasma exposure time of 2 s. The substrates were plasmaoxidized Si samples prepared in situ. A clear linear increasein thickness with the number of cycles can be observed atboth deposition temperatures. A thickness increase per cycleof 1.660.02 Å at 70 °C and 1.270.02 Å at 200 °C wascalculated from the slope of the data shown in Fig. 2. Nosignificant initial growth delay was observed in the first fewcycles of Al2O3 deposition both on the plasma oxidized Sisamples and on the thermal oxide covered c-Si.In situ SE was used to determine the saturated precursordosing regime associated with ALD film growth. The amountof AlCH33 introduced per precursor exposure was variedusing the trapped volume in the precursor line as describedearlier. The amount of precursor is fixed by the size of thetrapped volume 0.25 cm3 and the total precursor dosecan therefore be varied by varying the number of successiveprecursor exposures used per cycle. The thickness increaseper cycle i.e., growth rate, sometimes also referred to asgrowth per cycle is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of thenumber of successive AlCH33 exposures per cycle at 70and 200 °C. The figure reveals that saturated growth is ob-tained for a total precursor dose consisting of more than sixAlCH33 exposures per cycle for both temperatures.Under saturated AlCH33 dosing conditions i.e., morethan six exposures and 4 s plasma exposure the growth rateis 1.800.02 Å /cycle at 70 °C and 1.270.02 Å /cycle at200 °C. These values are higher than typically reported forthermal ALD process using H2O, i.e., 1.1 Å /cycle at 70 °Cand 1.0 Å /cycle at 200 °C.24,25 Also for the thermal ALDprocess with O3 lower growth rates were observed1.1 Å /cycle at 70 °C and 0.8 Å /cycle at 200 °C.5,49 Ahigher growth rate has been reported earlier for both remoteand direct plasmas compared to thermal ALD for identicaldeposition temperature settings.3,50,51 We would like to notethat the H2O based process suffers from the so-called softsaturation behavior, especially at low temperatures. Highdoses of H2O have been found necessary to reach saturatedfilm growth.3,25,52 Not fully saturated growth might thereforebe a reason for the lower growth rate reported for the thermalprocess based on H2O at 70 °C. A related aspect is that alsovery long purge times are required for removal of H2O fromFIG. 2.

Color online Growth rate per cycle as measured by SE at deposi-tion temperatures of 70 and 200 °C as a function of the number of succes-sive AlCH33 exposures used per ALD cycle. Also the mass gain deter-mined by QCM measurements at 70 °C is given.103302-4 Heil et al. J. Appl. Phys. 103, 103302 2008Downloaded 27 Jun 2008 to 131.155.108.71. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jap.aip.org/jap/copyright.jspthe reactor. These long purge times provide more time fordehydroxilation reactions,1,29 lowering the surface OH den-sity. One of the benefits of ALD using O3 or O2 plasma asoxidant sources is that the purge times do not have to beseverely extended to maintain proper ALD film growth atlow deposition temperatures 100 °C.3,5B. Mass uptake measurements by QCMQuartz crystal microbalance measurements were used tomonitor the mass uptake during a cycle at a substrate tem-perature of 70 °C. Figure 4 shows the mass gain recorded byQCM for ten ALD cycles using only one single AlCH33exposure i.e., a nonsaturated dose per cycle and a plasmaexposure time of 2 s. The QCM reveals a stepwise increasein mass in each ALD cycle. Also a negative spike is observedduring every O2 plasma step but this behavior can be attrib-uted to a plasma artifact as will be discussed below. Themass gain was also measured in an experiment in which thetotal precursor dose was varied in a similar experiment as forthe SE measurements. These results, obtained at 70 °C, arealso included in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, it is evident that also theQCM measurements reveal saturated growth for a dose con-sisting of more than six precursor exposures per cycle, inperfect agreement with the SE measurements.A detailed view of the QCM signal for one ALD cycle ispresented in Fig. 5. The time at which precursor valve wasopened and the period during which the plasma exposurewas active are indicated. When AlCH33 is introduced intothe reactor the chemisorption of the precursor to the surfacecan be observed in the form of a large stepwise increase inmass m1 Fig. 5a. At the moment when the plasma isswitched on, a sharp downward spike in the signal can beobserved. Different from thermal ALD, the occurrence ofelectrical charging by the presence of ions and electrons orpossibly plasma induced heat transfer apparently interfereswith a proper measurement during the plasma exposure. Thespike is a true plasma artifact, corroborated by the fact that asimilar spike is also observed when only the plasma is pulsedi.e., no AlCH33 dose has preceded the plasma exposure,as is presented in Fig. 5b. In both cases the signal slowlyrecovers to its genuine level after the plasma is switched off20 s. The main difference, however, is that in Fig. 5a asmall increase in mass m2?m1 can be observed after theplasma exposure. This increase in mass is not observed whenthe precursor has not been introduced see Fig. 5b. Themass increase can be related to the oxidation of bonded pre-cursor and the replacement of the surface functional groups.The behavior in Fig. 5a shows resemblance to what haspreviously been observed during QCM studies of thermalALD of Al2O3 at 70 °C. In these experiments during boththe AlCH33 and the H2O dosing, an increase in mass wasobserved.25 Although for plasma-assisted ALD of Al2O3 theexact reaction mechanism has still not been clearly estab-lished, when following the procedure introduced by Rahtuand Ritala,53 the origins for the mass gain after the AlCH33dose m1 and the plasma exposure m2 can be defined asm1 = MAlCH33 ? n · MCH4 , 3m2 = MAlO3/2 , 4where MAlCH33, MAlO3/2, and MCH4 represent themasses of the species involved, 72, 51, and 16 amu, respec-tively. On the basis of the previous measurements we canassume that reaction 3 occurs during the AlCH33 dosingin which n ?CH3 ligands leave to the gas phase as CH4molecules.22 Furthermore, for simplicity after the plasmastep a complete Al2O3 layer is considered to have beenformed. The possible presence of H on the surface after theplasma step is discarded since its mass is small compared tothe other masses involved. On the basis of these assumptionsthe number of CH3 ligands released from the surface intothe gas phase can be calculated by rewriting the ratio of themass uptake after the two half-reactions m1 /m2 toFIG. 4. Color online QCM measurements during plasma-assisted ALD ofAl2O3 at a deposition temperature of 70 °C. The mass gain is shown for tenreaction cycles with the length of one ALD cycle being indicated.

The intro-duction of AlCH33 and the start and end of the O2 plasma exposure areindicated.103302-5 Heil et al. J. Appl. Phys. 103, 103302 2008Downloaded 27 Jun 2008 to 131.155.108.71.

The values are somewhat closerto n=2 at the lower temperature side, whereas QCM yieldedalso somewhat higher values than QMS over the full tem-perature range.24C. Investigation of reaction products by QMSThe gas species injected in the reactor as well as thestable gas species created by the surface reactions were mea-sured using QMS. To achieve sufficient time resolution, themeasurement procedure as outlined in the experimental sec-tion Sec. II B was employed. The QMS signals of the m /zratios which showed the largest response to the ALD processare shown in Fig. 6 for two ALD cycles. The most likelyparent molecules leading to the signals shown have beenindicated in the figure. As mentioned earlier, the signals caneither be due to direct ionization or dissociative ionizationcracking of the corresponding molecule. Since a continu-ous O2 flow was used a relatively high signal was measuredat m /z=32 O2+ and m /z=16 O+ due to the dissociativeionization of O2 in the mass spectrometer. Furthermore, arelatively high signal at m /z=18 was measured ion currentof 4.510?12 A which can be attributed to H2O. It is gen-erally difficult to remove H2O from the vacuum system, in-cluding both the ALD reactor and the differentially pumpedQMS housing. The other masses which are shown in Fig. 6are m /z=15 CH3+, 28 CO+, and 44 CO2+. These signalshave their baseline close to the noise level of the mass spec-trometer ion current of 10?13 A. For clarity purposes, them /z=28 and m /z=44 signals are omitted during the secondcycle in Fig. 6.During AlCH33 dosing peaks can be observed at m /z=15 CH3+ and, albeit less clear due to the O2 background,also at m /z=16 CH4+. On the basis of cracking patterninformation, it can be concluded that CH4 is released fromthe surface during precursor dosing. Similar to thermal ALD,the detection of CH4 indicates that the AlCH33 precursorchemisorbs to the surface through a reaction, in which H isremoved from the surface by forming gaseous CH4 with a?CH3 ligand of the AlCH33. During the plasma exposurepeaks appear at m /z=18 H2O+, 44 CO2+, and 28 CO+,signaling the production of H2O, CO2, and possibly CO asdiscussed in our previous work.22 Furthermore the consump-tion of oxygen during the plasma exposure can be clearlyobserved by the decrease of signal at m /z=16 and 32.The CO+ signal has a comparable intensity during theplasma exposure as the CO2+ signal. On the basis of the CO2cracking pattern reported in literature m /z=44: 100% nor-malized peak height, m /z=28: 10% it is therefore conceiv-able that CO is present in the deposition chamber.54 Thedeviation from the literature values for CO2 can, however,also be attributed to a lower transmission of high masses inthe mass spectrometer. A dedicated experiment has, there-fore, been performed to investigate the ratio of CO and CO2in the plasma by calibrating our mass spectrometer signals.CO2 and CO gas from lecture bottles was introduced sepa-rately into the deposition reactor and a cracking spectrum ofboth species was determined at a pressure of 7.5 mTorr. Thecracking of CO2 was found to lead to the detection of mainlyCO2+ m /z=44: 100%, CO+ m /z=28: 18%, O+ m /z=16:25%, and C+ m /z=12: 20%. The cracking of CO led to thedetection of mainly CO+ 100% and some O+ 4% and C+7%. To determine the gas composition at the start of theplasma exposure during processing, an experiment was car-ried out in which O2 gas was mixed with CO and CO2 in thereactor keeping the total pressure constant at 7.5 mTorr.From tuning the ratio of O2, CO, and CO2 to the peak heightof the signals measured during processing, an estimate of thegas composition could be determined. On the basis of thesemeasurements it was found that the concentrations of COand CO2 in the plasma are comparable in magnitude and thatthey form a substantial part of the total gas composition atthe start of the plasma exposure 7 and 5 vol % for COand CO2, respectively.These results indicate that during the O2 plasma e
