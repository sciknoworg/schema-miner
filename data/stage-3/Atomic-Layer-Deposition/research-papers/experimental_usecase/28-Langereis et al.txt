From film analysis by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and variousex situ techniques, data on growth rate, atomic composition, mass density, TaNx microstructure, andresistivity are presented for films deposited at substrate temperatures between 150 and 250 °C. It isestablished that cubic TaNx films with a high mass density 12.1 g cm?3 and low electricalresistivity 380  cm can be deposited using a H2 plasma with the density and resistivity of thefilms improving with plasma exposure time. H2-N2 and NH3 plasmas resulted in N-rich Ta3N5 filmswith a high resistivity. It is demonstrated that the different TaNx phases can be distinguished in situby spectroscopic ellipsometry on the basis of their dielectric function with the magnitude of theDrude absorption yielding information on the resistivity of the films.

TaN is considered asa candidate to replace the poly-Si gate in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors,1 as metal electrode inhigh-density three dimensional 3D capacitors,2 and as Cudiffusion barrier35 and possible liner material for intercon-nect technology.6,7 In addition to a high level of growth con-trol, several applications require conformal deposition inhigh-aspect ratio structures, which is a requirement beyondreach of current physical vapor deposition PVD techniques.Due to its layer-by-layer growth, atomic layer depositionALD is believed to be the method of choice for depositionin demanding 3D features.4,810 Sequentially employing twoself-limiting surface reactions, a submonolayer of material isdeposited per ALD cycle and the process is proven to yieldexcellent uniformity and conformality.1113 Since differentTaNx crystal phases exist including low-resistivity cubic TaNand very-high-resistivity Ta3N5,14 successful integration ofTaNx films synthesized by ALD requires control over filmstoichiometry and composition.Several precursors are commercially available for ALDof TaNx films, such as TaNCH325 PDMAT,4 TaNC2H523NCCH33 TBTDET,15 TaNCCH32C2H5NCH323,16 TaCl5,10,17 and TaF5.18 For many applicationsmetal-organic precursors are preferred over metal-halide pre-cursors due to potential problems in reliability posed by ha-lide impurities in the film.4 In order to deposit the conductiveTaNx phase, the oxidation state of the Ta atom in the precur-sor +5 in most precursors has to be reduced to oxidationstate +3. Using the PDMAT precursor with NH3 in a thermalALD process, Travaly et al. observed that the high-resistivityTa3N5 phase was deposited.19 Ritala et al. showed that thereducing power of NH3 is indeed insufficient and thermalALD using TaCl5 precursor resulted in the deposition of theTa3N5 phase.10 They reported that they could only depositconductive TaNx films by thermal ALD when applying addi-tional zinc dosing during the NH3 exposure. Recently, it wasdemonstrated that low-resistivity TaN films can be depositedby plasma-assisted ALD using the reducing power of a H2plasma in combination with the metal-organic precursorsPDMAT Ref. 4 or TBTDET.15 Sreenivasan et al. reportedthe deposition of Ta3N5 using an amido-based Ta precursorand a H2-N2 plasma and they showed that the conductivecubic TaNx phase could be obtained from this material by apostdeposition thermal anneal at 850 °C.20 From the afore-mentioned results it is clear that plasma-assisted ALD canyield different TaNx compositions which are determined bythe plasma conditions and gas mixtures used. Plasma-assisted ALD provides therefore additional freedom to tailorthe deposition process and the resulting TaNx film propertiesto order. However, comprehensive studies on the influence ofdifferent plasma conditions and different gas mixtures on theTaNx properties are still lacking.aElectronic mail: e.langereis@tue.nlbAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jap.aip.org/jap/copyright.jspObviously, accurate and sensitive diagnostics to charac-terize the film growth process and the resulting materialproperties are essential for the development of suitable TaNxALD processes. In particular, in situ diagnostics are gener-ally preferred as they can return immediate information onthe process and films deposited while they can also be usedfor online process control. In previous work, we introducedspectroscopic ellipsometry SE for an in situ study of re-mote plasma ALD of conductive TiN films.21 It was demon-strated that SE is a powerful tool to investigate ALD pro-cesses. It yields thickness information which can, forexample, be used to study the growth rate per cycle, nucle-ation effects, and fast ALD cycle optimization. Moreover, italso gives insight into the material properties. For example,for conductive materials information on the electric filmproperties such as resistivity and electron mean free path canbe extracted during the deposition process.21 This kind ofinformation has recently also been extracted by SE for sput-tered TaNx films, as reported by Aouadi and Debessai22 andMistrik et al.23 The plasma-assisted ALD process also yieldsthe possibility to use plasma-related diagnostics during theplasma exposure step. In our previous work on plasma-assisted ALD of Al2O3 from a metal-organic precursor andO2 plasma, we showed that optical emission spectroscopycan yield information on the ALD reaction mechanisms andthe timing of the plasma step.24 Evidently, similar insight canbe expected for plasma-assisted ALD for metal nitrides.In this article, we report on the plasma-assisted ALDprocess of TaNx films from PDMAT precursor and differentremote plasma conditions. Whereas in PVD processes theTaNx film properties can be tuned by controlling the N2 pres-sure and deposition temperature,14 we will show that a goodcontrol over TaNx properties can be achieved in the plasma-assisted ALD process using different plasma gas composi-tions H2, H2-N2 mixtures, and NH3 and plasma exposuretimes. The influence of the plasma exposure time is particu-larly interesting in this respect since the continuous interac-tion between the plasma radicals and the growing film can beused to alter the material properties even after completedremoval of the precursor ligands, whereas in thermal ALDthe material properties depend solely on the chemical reac-tions between the precursors and reactive surface groups. Forthe different TaNx films synthesized, the material propertieswere determined using various ex situ analysis techniqueswhereas spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to monitor thefilm growth in situ. It is demonstrated that different TaNxphases can be distinguished during the deposition process bymeasuring the dielectric function of the films by in situ SE.Furthermore, optical emission spectroscopy OES is intro-duced during plasma-assisted ALD of TaNx to reveal infor-mation on the ALD reactions and to determine the requireddosing of precursor and plasma step to achieve ALD growthsaturation.First, the experimental configuration and ellipsometrydata analysis procedure will be described in detail in Secs. IIand III, respectively. In Sec. IV, the ALD film growth and thematerial properties of the TaNx films for the different depo-sition conditions, such as deposition temperature, plasma ex-posure time, and plasma gas composition, will be presentedand discussed. Process characterization by in situ SE andOES during the ALD process is also described in Sec. IV.The conclusions of this work are summarized in Sec. V.II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILSA. Remote plasma ALD reactor and processconditionsThe experimental setup is schematically shown in Fig.1a and consists of a vacuum chamber equipped with a re-mote plasma source and a precursor dosing system. The con-figuration is similar to the setup used for the TiN depositiondescribed in previous work21,25 and therefore mainly the as-pects relevant for remote plasma ALD of TaNx films will bebriefly discussed.The solid metal-organic precursor TaNCH325 PD-MAT, pentakisdimethylaminotantalum, Sigma-Aldrich,99.99% purity was contained in a stainless steel bubblerheated to 75 °C to reach adequate vapor pressure.

This Ar flow is also used for purging the chamberafter precursor dosing using a divert line. In addition, thechamber was pumped down 10?4 Torr after purging toremove any remaining gaseous precursor and reaction by-products before plasma excitation. The PDMAT gas lines andvacuum chamber were heated 80 °C by heating tape toprevent precursor condensation during transport to the sub-strate. To avoid film deposition in the plasma source, the topvalve positioned between the source and chamber was closedduring the PDMAT dosing.The ALD reaction was completed by exposing the sub-strate to a plasma generated in the remote inductivelycoupled plasma source. The radio frequency power coupling100 W was optimized by impedance matching.25 Differentgases H2, N2 purities 99.999%, and NH3 purity99.995% and their mixtures can be fed into the plasmasource to investigate the effect of the plasma gas composi-tion on the TaNx material properties. The plasma gas pres-sure was set to 7.5 mTorr for all depositions.A typical ALD cycle used for the deposition of TaNxfilms is represented in Fig. 1b and the switching on/off ofthe relevant valves and gas flows is indicated. The TaNxfilms were deposited on resistively heated substrates in thetemperature window of 150250 °C. The silicon substratesp-type Si 1030  cm did not undergo additional clean-ing steps and were covered with a 12 nm native oxidelayer. Typically a 2 in. substrate size was used, but a 4 in.substrate holder could be used for deposition on larger sizedsubstrates.B. In situ diagnosticsThe ALD film growth was monitored by in situ SE usingthe two optical viewports on the chamber that allow for SEmeasurements under a fixed angle of incidence of 68° to thesubstrate normal Fig. 1. Pneumatic gate valves separatedthe vacuum chamber and the viewports to prevent film depo-sition on the optical ports. A visible and near-infrared rotat-ing compensator ellipsometer J.A. Woollam, Inc., M2000Uwas used for the in situ SE measurements such that the TaNxdielectric function could be determined in the photon energyrange of 0.755.0 eV. In addition, a visible and ultravioletextended J.A. Woollam, Inc., M2000D, 1.26.5 eV ellip-someter was used ex situ to probe the dielectric functiondeeper into the ultraviolet. The different parametrizationsused to model the conductive and high-resistivity TaNx filmswill be described in more detail in Sec. III.An optical viewport on the side of the chamber allowedfor OES to study the emission of excited species during theplasma step in the ALD cycle. An Ocean Optics USB2000spectrometer was used with a wavelength detection range of250870 nm and a resolution of approximately 1 nm. Thelight was collected by an optical fiber placed in front of theside viewport of the reactor chamber and was dispersed via afixed grating across a linear charge coupled device array de-tector. The typical integration time used was 100 ms.C. Ex situ material analysisElectrical resistivity measurements were carried out atroom temperature using a Signatone four-point probe FPPin combination with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter acting bothas current source and as a voltage meter. The sheet resistancewas determined from the slope of the I-V curve and theresistivity was obtained after multiplication by the film thick-ness deduced from the SE measurements. The film composi-tion was determined from Rutherford backscattering spec-troscopy RBS and elastic recoil detection ERD using2 MeV 4He+ ions. The ion beam was targeted at the surfaceat two different angles ?80° and ?10° for every sample toget improved sensitivity for both the heavy and light ele-ments, while it also allowed for depth profiling of the TaNxlayer. The RBS and ERD data were modeled using the RUMPprogram.26 X-ray diffraction XRD was performed to deter-mine the film microstructure using a Philips XPert MPDdiffractometer equipped with a Cu K source 1.54 Å radia-tion. To reduce the measurement time a Philips XCeleratordetector was used and to increase the surface sensitivity themeasurements were performed under a grazing angle of in-cidence. The thickness and mass density were also deter-mined from x-ray reflectometry XRR measurements carriedout on a Bruker D8 Advance x-ray diffractometer.III. SPECTROSCOPIC ELLIPSOMETRY ON TaNX FILMSA. Data acquisition and optical modelSpectroscopic ellipsometry data can be acquired in situafter every ALD cycle after opening the gate valves to thelight source and detector, but typically data were obtainedafter 10 completed cycles. A high signal-to-noise ratio wasobtained by averaging each SE measurement over 400 dataacquisitions, which led to a measurement time of approxi-mately 45 s. After the measurement, the gate valves wereclosed and the deposition process continued. The WVASE32software from J.A. Woollam was used to analyze ellipsom-etry data.27 In WVASE32 in situ ellipsometry data from thenear infrared NIR-extended ellipsometer can be combinedwith ex situ data obtained on the same film by the UV-extended ellipsometer. This makes it possible to determinethe dielectric functions of the different TaNx films over thephoton energy range from 0.75 to 6.5 eV.The ellipsometry data can be expressed in terms of thepseudodielectric function , which is represented in real1 and imaginary 2 parts. From model-based analysis ofthe ellipsometry data, the thickness of the film and the opti-cal constants of the TaNx film can be extracted. Prior to thefilm deposition, the pseudodielectric function of the substratewas determined in order to isolate the starting substrate fromthe deposited TaNx film. The Si substrates with native oxidewere modeled by a semi-infinite Si layer of which the opticalconstants were obtained by a point-to-point fit and a topoxide layer of 1.5 nm as described by the Cauchy relation.The TaNx film deposited was modeled by adding a layer ontop of the substrate and various parametrizations were usedto describe the different TaNx optical properties. Assump-tions within this approach were that the deposition process083517-3 Langereis et al. J. Appl. Phys. 102, 083517 2007Downloaded 11 Mar 2010 to 131.155.151.137. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jap.aip.org/jap/copyright.jspdoes not affect the substrate properties and that a surfaceroughness layer can be neglected, which was corroborated bythe small surface roughness 0.3 nm measured by atomicforce microscopy. More details on the ellipsometer configu-ration and measurement procedure during remote plasmaALD can be found elsewhere.21B. Dielectric function of TaNx filmsThe dielectric functions of the conductive TaNx,x1phase and semiconductive Ta3N5 phase are quite dissimilarand this fact lies at the basis for the distinction between thedifferent TaNx phases by SE. The parametrizations used todescribe the dielectric functions of these TaNx films will beintroduced below. A comparison between typical parametersderived from the SE data and ex situ analysis is presented inthe subsequent section.1. Conductive TaNx filmsThe low-resistivity TaNx,x1 films were described by aDrude-Lorentz oscillator parametrization. The Drude oscilla-tor accounts for the intraband absorption by conduction elec-trons and contains information on the metallic properties ofthe film. The Lorentz oscillators account for the interbandabsorption by bound electrons. Following the literature onPVD TaN films,22,23 we used a combination of one Drudeand two Lorentz oscillators to describe the dielectric functionof the conductive TaNx deposited by ALD: =  ?pu22 ? iD+ j=12f j0j20j2 ? 2 + i j. 1In Eq. 1,  is equal or larger than unity to compensate forthe contribution of higher-energy transitions that are nottaken into account by the Lorentz terms. The Drude term ischaracterized by the unscreened plasma energy pu and thedamping factor D. The Lorentz oscillators were located atenergy position 0j, with strength f j and damping factor  j.For TaNx, the two Lorentz oscillators account for interbandabsorptions around 2.2 and 6.4 eV.22,23The imaginary 2 part of the dielectric function for atypical TaNx film with a low resistivity is shown in Fig. 2aand the contributions of the Drude and Lorentz oscillatorsare indicated. In particular, the NIR extension of the spectro-scopic ellipsometer aids to distinguish the Drude absorptionfrom the strong Lorentz oscillator around 2.2 eV, while thesecond Lorentz oscillator is determined more accurately us-ing the UV-extended SE.Several film properties, such as electron density, electri-cal resistivity, electron mean free path, and mass density, canbe calculated from the Drude absorption as was shown forDrude parameters obtained for TiN films.21 However, thedata modeling of the thin TaNx films revealed that the Drudeamplitude and broadening are correlated, which is caused bythe large Lorentz oscillator around 2.2 eV. Consequently,only the ratio of the Drude parameters could be uniquelydetermined. Since the electrical resistivity is defined by theratio of Drude fit parameters,21,28 =  10 Dpu2 , 2where 0 is the permittivity of free space, the electrical re-sistivity can be unambiguously determined from SE mea-surements.2. Semiconductive TaNx filmsThe dielectric function of amorphous semiconductorsand insulators is often described by the Tauc-Lorentzmodel.2931 When multiple transitions are possible in the ma-terial, additional Tauc-Lorentz oscillators can be added to theparametrization.32 To model the high-resistive Ta3N5 phase,we used a double Tauc-Lorentz model with the imaginarypart of the dielectric function 2 given by2E = j=12AjE0j jE ? Egj2E2 ? E0j2 2 +  j2E21E, E  Egj ,=0, E  Egj .3In Eq. 3, Egj is the band gap, E0j the peak transition energy, j the broadening parameter, and Aj represents the opticalFIG. 2.

The dielectricfunctions are parametrized using a a Drude and two Lorentz oscillators andb using two Tauc-Lorentz oscillators. The photon energy ranges from thenear infrared 0.75 eV to the ultraviolet 6.5 eV. The conductive TaNx,x1film was deposited using 10 s H2 plasma in the ALD cycle, while the Ta3N5film was deposited using 10 s NH3 plasma.083517-4 Langereis et al. J. Appl. Phys. 102, 083517 2007Downloaded 11 Mar 2010 to 131.155.151.137.

The first oscillator definesthe position of the optical band gap of the Ta3N5 film, whilethe second oscillator accounts for absorption above the ab-sorption edge, as was also reported for the modeling ofTa2O5 films.32,33 For a Ta3N4.6 film that was deposited usinga H2-N2 plasma, an additional Lorentz oscillator was re-quired to account for absorption below the band gap, as willbe presented in Sec. IV D.C. Typical SE results and comparison with ex situfilm analysisA typical example of the film thickness as a function ofthe number of ALD cycles as obtained from the SE measure-ments is shown in Fig. 3. Data are presented for both con-ductive TaNx,x1 and highly resistive Ta3N5 films. The ALDprocess was halted each time after a certain amount of cyclesto acquire SE data and to calculate the film thickness em-ploying the appropriate parametrization. The linear growthbehavior of the plasma-assisted ALD process can clearly beobserved in Fig. 3 for both TaNx phases. The final film thick-ness deduced from the SE modeling was found to be in goodagreement with the thickness determined by XRR see alsoTable I. The growth rates were calculated from a linear fit tothe data and resulted in 0.048±0.005 nm/cycle and0.056±0.005 nm/cycle for the TaNx,x1 and Ta3N5 films,respectively. Note that Fig. 3 also reveals that the thicknessof the TaNx films deposited from PDMAT precursor is im-mediately linear at the onset of growth. Therefore, a distinctnucleation delay was absent as was observed before duringthe plasma-assisted ALD of TiN using the metal-halide TiCl4precursor and a H2-N2 plasma.21Since data can be obtained after every cycle, in situ SEallows for a fast determination of the ALD saturation curves.For different ALD conditions as set by the combination ofprecursor dosing, plasma exposure time, and substrate tem-perature, the growth rate for each condition was calculatedFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jap.aip.org/jap/copyright.jspfrom the increase in film thickness determined over80 cycles by taking SE measurements after every 10 ALDcycles. By a systematic variation of the process parameters,the ALD saturation curves were determined from a singledeposition run of one sample. Such saturation curves, shownin Fig. 4, will be discussed in Sec. IV, but here it is alreadymentioned that the growth rates were found to be similar tothe growth rates determined from separate depositions ofthick films 30 nm at constant process parameters.The resistivity determined from the SE data using theDrude-Lorentz model can be compared to the resistivity de-termined by ex situ FPP measurements. As the FPP yields theresistivity of the TaNx films at room temperature, first thetemperature coefficient of resistivity TCR of the TaNx filmwas determined by in situ SE. The change in resistivity asmonitored upon cooling down the substrate in the vacuumsetup revealed a small TCR of ?30±30 ppm/K for the TaNxfilms. Baba and Hatada reported a similar TCR value of?80±30 ppm/K which was relatively independent of theTaNx composition.34 Consequently, within the experimentaluncertainty, the resistivity obtained at deposition temperatureby in situ SE can be directly compared to the room tempera-ture resistivity obtained by ex situ FPP. It was found thatresistivity values obtained by SE and FPP are in relativelygood agreement with each other for plasma exposure timeslonger than 10 s see Table I. Only one data point 3 s H2plasma showed a clear discrepancy but as discussed in Sec.IV C the corresponding sample showed a deviating behaviorcompared to the rest of the sample set, possibly due to thepresence of Ta-C bonds. The SE data for this particularsample were also difficult to fit with the Drude-Lorentzmodel. Finally, it can be concluded that the generally goodagreement between the thickness and resistivity values asextracted from SE with the results of the ex situ film analysisvalidates the SE data interpretation and modeling employed.IV. TANX FILM GROWTH AND MATERIALPROPERTIESThe TaNx films were deposited by remote plasma ALDunder various process conditions. In particular, the plasmaexposure time, the plasma gas composition, and the deposi-tion temperature were varied. Table I summarizes the processconditions and resulting material properties, i.e., film thick-ness, film composition, electrical resistivity, and mass den-sity. In the following section, first the saturation in growthrate for the various ALD process parameters will be ad-dressed and subsequently, the material properties will be dis-cussed. It will be shown that the TaNx properties can becontrolled by the plasma exposure time and by the plasmagas composition. Finally, the characterization of the ALDprocess by optical emission spectroscopy during the plasmastep will be presented.A. Growth rate of remote plasma ALD processThe saturation of the growth rate per cycle as being typi-cal for ALD is investigated by varying the process param-eters, i.e., PDMAT dosing time, plasma exposure time, anddeposition temperature. The results are presented in Fig. 4for TaNx,x1 films deposited with a H2 plasma. During thevariation of the PDMAT dosing time, the H2 plasma expo-sure time was set to 10 s and the deposition temperature was225 °C. A clear saturation in growth rate as a function ofprecursor dosing is observed in Fig. 4a and the growth ratesaturated at 0.045±0.004 nm/cycle for PDMAT dosingtimes exceeding 3 s. As shown in Fig. 4a, the data can befitted with a single exponential function describing the ex-pected saturation behavior during precursor absorption.35FIG. 4. Color online Growth rate per cycle of TaNx,x1 films as a functionof the ALD process parameters: a PDMAT dosing time, b H2 plasmaexposure time, and c deposition temperature.

Figure 4b shows a so-called soft saturation ingrowth rate with H2 plasma exposure time. The data pointscan be fitted using an exponential function with two timeconstants. The fast initial increase in growth rate can be at-tributed to the ligand removal from the surface, whereas theslow increase in growth rate for plasma exposure time3 s can be related to a change in TaNx composition cf.Table I with increasing plasma exposure time. This effectwill be discussed in more detail in Sec. IV B.Using a PDMAT dosing of 4 s and H2 plasma exposuretime of 10 s, the temperature dependence of the growth ratewas studied for deposition temperatures in the range of150250 °C. Figure 4c shows that the growth rate re-mained constant at 0.050±0.004 nm/cycle within the tem-perature window studied.The saturated growth rate per cycle can be compared tothe results reported by Kim and co-workers obtained with asimilar remote plasma ALD process.4,36 They calculated thegrowth rate 0.03 nm/cycle from RBS measurements usingthe bulk mass density of cubic TaN 15.9 g cm?3,37 which isexpected to be a higher limit for thin TaNx films deposited byALD. Assuming a similar mass density for their films asobtained by our work see Table I leads to growth rates percycle
