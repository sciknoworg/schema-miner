A. van Helvoirt,aMarcel A. Verheijena and Wilhelmus M. M. Kessels*acDoped ZnO films are an important class of transparent conductive oxides, with many applicationsdemanding increased growth control and low deposition temperatures. Therefore, the preparation ofB-doped ZnO films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 150 1C was studied. The B source was triisopropylborate, B(OiPr)3 (TIB), which has a significantly lower vapour pressure and is a safer alternative precursor tohighly toxic diborane(6), B2H6. The doping fraction (DF) of the films was varied by the ratio of ZnO anddopant ALD cycles. The electrical, structural and optical properties of the ZnO:B films were studied as afunction of the dopant concentration and deposition temperature, and were compared with ZnO:Al films,where dimethylaluminium isopropoxide, [Al(CH3)2(OiPr)]2 (DMAI) and trimethylaluminium, Al2(CH3)6 (TMA)were the Al sources. A low resistivity of 3.5 mO cm was achieved for 45 nm-thick ZnO:B deposited at150 1C with a doping fraction (DF) of 0.016, which was similar to the results obtained for ZnO:Al filmsprepared with DMAI and lower compared to the 8 mO cm achieved for ZnO:Al prepared with TMA at anoptimized DF of 0.040. Hence TIB, as well as DMAI, outperformed the conventionally employed TMA interms of doping efficiency at 150 1C. It was found that the optical band gap could be easily tuned overthe range of B3.23.7 eV by modifying the doping fraction.1 IntroductionTin-doped indium oxide (ITO) is the most popular transparentconductive oxide (TCO) for optoelectronic devices, but thescarcity and relative expense of indium has led to alternativeTCO materials being sought.1,2 ZnO has many intrinsic propertiesthat makes it a good candidate for a TCO material as it has adirect wide band gap of B3.4 eV, a refractive index of B2.0 andelectron mobilities as high as 5060 cm2 V1 s1.36 ZnO filmsexhibit good optical transparency below the band gap and theirconductivity can be increased by doping with a group 13 element(i.e., ZnO:X where X = Al, B, Ga, In).7,8ZnO (either intrinsic, i.e. without intentional doping, ordoped) is especially of interest for application fields with verystrict cost requirements, such as the field of photovoltaics (PV).For example, ZnO is employed on the front and/or rear of siliconheterojunction (SHJ) solar cells,911 used as multifunctional frontcontact on thin film solar cells such as amorphous silicon,Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS), CdTe, or organic solar cells,6,12,13 or it actsas a buffer layer or semi-transparent cathode in organic photo-voltaics (OPV)14,15 or as a nanostructured photoanode or interlayerin dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs).16,17For many TCO applications, particularly in PV, ultrathin(doped) ZnO films with a low resistivity (o1 mO cm) and a hightransparency (480%) in the spectral region of interest arerequired.6,18 Preferably, the low resistivity should be a resultof high carrier mobility rather than high free-electron density, thelatter resulting in a decrease in transparency, especially in theinfrared region.19 Low deposition temperatures (o200 1C) and atuneable roughness are other requirements for certain types ofsolar cells, such as CIGS, flexible plastic DSCs and SHJ cells.ZnO and doped ZnO thin films have been grown by variousmethods such as spray pyrolysis,20,21 solgel deposition,22,23sputtering,24,25 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),25,26 chemical bathdeposition (CBD),27,28 metalorganic chemical vapour deposition(MOCVD),29,30 and atomic layer deposition (ALD).1214,31,32 ALD, inparticular, is becoming a popular deposition technique as it allowsfor deposition at low temperatures, it is a soft method withouthighly energetic species and it is scalable.

Recentreviews emphasise the potential of ALD to contribute towardsachieving high-efficiency solar cells.33,34Many articles have been published on the ALD of intrinsicZnO and ZnO:Al, mostly using TMA as an Al source, but farfewer using other dopant materials. TMA is a highly reactivemolecule, which has led to its popularity as an ALD precursor.However, this high reactivity can lead to difficulty in controllingdoping levels. Furthermore, it is pyrophoric, making it potentiallydifficult to handle and dangerous in high quantities such as thoseused in high-volume manufacturing. In this article, we investigatethe ALD of ZnO:B using an alternative B source, triisopropyl borate(TIB), in conjunction with a ZnO ALD process comprising diethylzinc(DEZ) and H2O half-cycles. First, a brief review of the state-of-the-artof ALD ZnO:X (X = Al, B) and the precursors used to date isreported. Second, the electronic, structural and optical proper-ties of the ZnO:B films obtained using TIB are presented andcompared with the properties of the ZnO:Al films obtained usingconventional TMA and alternative DMAI precursors under thesame conditions.35,362 ALD of ZnO:X and precursorsALD is an ultrathin film deposition technique comprisingalternating exposures of gaseous precursors, known as half-cycles,to a surface (substrate) separated by purging steps to ensure theprecursors do not mix.37,38 ALD excels in producing highly uniformand conformal films with a precise growth control and is compatiblewith deposition temperatures from room temperature up toB350 1C,3941 where the higher end of the temperature range islimited by the decomposition temperature of the metalorganicprecursor.4042 The cyclic nature of ALD means that doses of dopantsources can easily be incorporated into the process. The techniquealso allows for the deposition of virtually defect-free films withtailored compositions (via doping) and it can easily be used toproduce multilayer structures.4347 Doping is often achieved bycombining the steps of two normal ALD processes in a supercycle,where m cycles of the base material process (in this case ZnO) arefollowed by one cycle of the doping material (Fig. 1). The number ofcycles m is chosen to obtain the desired film composition, and thesupercycle (m + 1) is repeated x times until the desired film thicknessis reached. The value of m can also be varied in the supercyclesthroughout the deposition process in order to obtain films withgraded doping.A wide selection of elements with a different valency to Zncan be used to dope ZnO, such as Al, B, Ga, Ge, H, Hf, Mn, N, P,S, Si, Sn, Ti, and Zr. A complete review of doping materials forZnO by ALD can be found in the recently published review byTynell et al.32Reported ALD processes for ZnO:X (X = Al, B) are sum-marised in Table 1. In almost all cases of ZnO ALD, DEZ isused as the Zn source. The most commonly-employed dopant isAl and the most frequently used Al-source for the ALD of ZnO:Alis trimethylaluminium (TMA), as evidenced by the large numberof publications reporting it.8,43,44,4877 The main reason behindthis is that TMA is a well-documented precursor and is exten-sively used within the ALD community. However, TMA is a highlyvolatile molecule39,78 and it is very reactive towards a variety ofsurface groups, which is ideal for pure Al2O3 ALD processes butthat can make doping using ALD difficult to control because it istoo reactive to afford a sufficiently low surface density of Alatoms. Aluminium isopropoxide (AIP) has also been reported asan alternative Al source in the ALD of ZnO:Al,79 where itspotential advantage is that AIP is less reactive than TMA towardssurface groups, which makes doping potentially easier to control.Fig. 1 A schematic representation of two ALD supercycles used to dope the ZnO films with a doping element, X (X = Al, B, Ga, etc.). For uniform doping,a constant value of m is used (m1 = m2 =  = mn) whereas for films with graded doping, the value of m can be varied. Details of the ALD processes areshown in the lower part of the figure: the process for the ZnO based material comprises two half-cycles in which DEZ and H2O are dosed; in most cases,the ALD process of the doping material also comprises two doses: dopant precursor dosing and H2O dosing. Other co-reactants such as O3 or O2 plasmacan also be employed instead of H2O, for both the ZnO and the doping element.Paper Journal of Materials Chemistry CPublished on 05 February 2015.

C, 2015, 3, 3095--3107 | 3097However, AIP is a solid at room temperature and exists as atetramer.80 Consequently, the low volatility of AIP could prove tobe challenging in some ALD systems as it can require heating upto B130 1C before an optimum vapour pressure for growth isobtained. A compromise in reactivity and volatility between TMAand AIP can be found in the heteroleptic precursor dimethyl-aluminium isopropoxide, [AlMe2(OiPr)]2 (DMAI), which has beenemployed as an ALD precursor to both Al2O381,82 and ZnO:Al thinfilms.36,83 We recently reported the ALD of ZnO:Al using DMAI,which led to higher doping efficiencies (i.e., higher active dopantdensities) and lower resistivities than those obtained when TMAwas used.36 This improved doping efficiency resulted from a lowersurface density of Al atoms due to the lower reactivity of DMAI andthe steric hindrance caused by the bulky OiPr ligands on theprecursor.The most commonly reported B source for thin film deposi-tion is diborane(6) (B2H6), which is an extremely flammable gasat room temperature. It is also highly toxic89 and is conse-quently typically used as a 110% solution in H2. B2H6 has beenthe most widely used as a CVD precursor to ZnO:B9098 with, todate, relatively few reports of its use in ALD.8588 We believethat the reason behind this low number of publications on theuse of B2H6 for ALD is its extremely high vapour pressure,99which is not easy to control under ALD conditions. Further-more, the highly toxic nature of B2H6 means it is undesirable tohandle, which has led to alternatives being sought.Potential candidates for the B source were considered basedon the precursors that had been used for CVD of B-containingfilms. CVD processes using precursors such as borazine,100B,B0,B00-trichloroborazine101 and tris(dimethylamido)borane102106have been reported, although in those cases the target materialwas BN. Boron tribromide (BBr3) has been used as an ALDprecursor to B2O3107 and BN;108 however, bromide impurities inthe film can be extremely detrimental to its electrical properties.Specifically concerning ZnO:B, a recent study was carried out inorder to investigate safer precursors than B2H6 for CVD,109,110wherein N,N0,N00-trimethylborazine, trimethyl borate and triisopro-pyl borate (TIB) were employed as the B sources. The ZnO:B filmsdeposited using these aforementioned precursors had comparableresistivities to films where B2H6 was used. Based on these results,the selection of a potential B-source candidate for ALD was donefor this work. In terms of their use as an ALD precursor, N,N0,N00-trimethylborazine was not considered because, being isostructuralwith benzene, it was unclear how it could react with surface groupsin an ALD mechanism. Regarding trimethyl borate, its vapourpressure (100 Torr at 20 1C)109 was unpractical. On this basis, TIBwas chosen as the most promising ALD precursor for ZnO:B.We report here the use of TIB as an alternative B precursorfor the ALD of ZnO:B and we compare the results with ZnO:Alfilms deposited using DMAI and TMA as Al sources. Weextended the temperature range of the recently reported ZnO:AlALD process using DMAI36 from 250 1C down to 150 1C in orderto compare the film properties given by the two differentdopants. A comparison of these two precursors with their moretraditional counterparts is given in Table 2. The TIB and DMAImolecules, which contain OiPr ligands, are large compared to TMA.The presence of OiPr results in possible steric hindrance, thusaffording a lower surface density of the doping element andTable 1 Precursors used for the ALD of ZnO:X (X = Al, B).

Additionally, like DMAI, TIB isnot pyrophoric, making it safer to handle for high-volume,high-throughput ALD systems, especially operating at atmo-spheric pressure.1113 ExperimentalThe ZnO doping ALD processes were carried out in an open-load ALDreactor (OpALt, Oxford Instruments), as reported previously.35,36Samples were deposited with different doping concentrations overa range of substrate temperatures (150240 1C). 7059 corning glass,silicon wafers with a native oxide layer, and silicon wafers with a450 nm-thick thermally-grown SiO2 layer were used as sub-strates. Diethyl zinc (DEZ 4 99.999%, Dockweiler Chemicals)and triisopropyl borate (TIB 4 98%, Air Liquide) were used as Znand B-doping precursors respectively. Dimethylaluminium iso-propoxide (DMAI 4 99.999%, Air Liquide) and trimethyl aluminium(TMA 4 99.999%, Air Liquide) were used as reference Al dopingprecursors. Deionized water vapour (DI-H2O) was used as theco-reactant in all cases. The ZnO:B ALD process details willfollow in Section 4.1. The ZnO:Al ALD processes using DMAIand TMA as doping precursors are described elsewhere.35,82Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to measure the filmthickness and the dielectric function of the films.123 The in situand ex situ measurements were performed using a Woollam, Inc.M2000 visible and near-infrared ellipsometer (0.755 eV). The SEdata were analysed using a Drude oscillator model.35The film compositions (doping and impurity concentra-tions) were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPSThermo Scientific K-Alpha KA1066, monochromatic Al Ka (hn =1486.6 eV), X-ray spot: 400 mm). The sensitivity factors used forquantification were: B 1s, 0.470; O 1s, 2.881; Zn 2p3/2, 21.391; Al2p, 0.75; C 1s, 0.919. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry(RBS; 2 MeV He+ beam in channelling configuration underperpendicular incidence with the detector at 1701 scatteringangle) and proton-induced gamma ray emission (PIGE; 2700keV H+ beam with an angle of incidence of 6.51 between thebeam and sample surface and the gamma detector at an angleof 901 with respect to the beam) were used to calibrate thesensitivity factors used in XPS quantification and to obtain theareal density of the doping elements. The RBS/PIGE measure-ments were carried out at AccTec B.V. The film composition ispresented as the doping fraction (DF) calculated byDF ¼ Xat%Xat% þ Znat%, where X = Al or B.The resistivity (r) and sheet resistance (Rs) of all sampleswere obtained by four-point probe (4pp) measurements using aKeithley 2400 SourceMeter and a Signaton S-301-6 probe. Thecarrier concentration (n) was extracted from SE data assumingan effective mass of 0.4 and cross-checked using a Hall measure-ment system (BIO-RAD) using the van der Pauw configuration.The electron mobility (m) of the films was calculated followingthe formula m = (nre)1, where e is the elementary charge.The structural properties of the samples were studied byX-ray diffraction (XRD; PanAlytical Xpert PRO MRD) andtransmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL ARM 200 probecorrected TEM, operated at 200 kV). UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy(Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies) was used to study the opticaltransparency of the films. The absorption coefficient (a) wascalculated from the extinction coefficient (k) of the films asobtained by the SE data. The optical band gap of the films wascalculated using the so-called Tauc plots extracted from the SEdata as well.35,1244 Results and discussion4.1 Process properties and atomic composition of ALD filmsThe ZnO doping ALD processes were carried out using so-calledsupercycles as illustrated in Fig. 1. In principle, the concept ofsupercycle is effective when the two individual ALD processes(i.e., the base material ALD process and the dopant ALDprocess) are compatible with each other. Additionally, theALD supercycle should be in saturation when the two individualALD processes are in saturation. This is in fact the case for theZnO and Al2O3 ALD processes used to obtain Al-doped ZnO filmsthat we reported previously.35,36,82Attempts to obtain a B2O3 ALD process using TIB with eitherwater or an O2 plasma as co-reactants resulted in no growth atall temperatures investigated. As part of their studies on theBBr3H2O ALD process, Putkonen and Niinisto? suggested thatvolatile boric acid, B(OH)3, was formed instead of B2O3 whenthe boron precursor came into contact with excess water underreduced pressure.107 The boric acid was then carried away inthe vacuum rather than being incorporated into a growing film.We believe that a similar mechanism might take place whenTIB is the precursor, which would account for the lack ofgrowth of B2O3. However, it was still possible to grow ZnO:Bfilms using TIB incorporated into a supercycle using the DEZH2O process. For this reason, the parameters of the ALDprocess for the B dopant were tuned during the ZnO dopingALD process at 150 1C using a supercycle with m = 4 (i.e., 5cycles consisting of 4 ZnO + 1 TIB) and using the already-optimised ZnO ALD process parameters (50 ms DEZ dose, 5 spurge, 20 ms H2O dose, 6 s purge).35 For the process develop-ment, in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used tomeasure the film thickness after every supercycle. Growth persupercycle (GPSC) values were determined from the slope of thegraphs of the thickness as a function of the number of super-cycles (see Fig. S1 of the ESI). We report here the GPSC ratherthan the growth per cycle (GPC) for the doping process, as ittakes into account possible atypical interactions that mightoccur between the DEZH2O and TIBH2O ALD processes, forexample, nucleation delays or etching.35The saturation curves for the gas exposures and purges ofthe B cycle of an ALD supercycle corresponding to four DEZcycles and one TIB cycle for the ZnO:B process are depicted inFig. 2. These data were obtained by varying the duration of oneof the ALD cycle steps, while keeping the duration of othersteps sufficiently long to ensure either saturation of surfacereactions or sufficient purging. The saturation GPSC wasPaper Journal of Materials Chemistry CPublished on 05 February 2015. Downloaded by TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN on 27/03/2015 13:44:49.

The TIB and H2O doses (Fig. 2a and c,respectively) both reached saturation at pulse times of B50 ms.It would be expected that longer precursor doses wouldincrease the GPSC until the process is saturated. However,the TIB dose (Fig. 2a) showed a drop in GPSC such that, aftersaturation, it was B0.12 nm per supercycle lower than that forthe intrinsic ZnO process (i.e., TIB dose = 0 s in Fig. 2a) at150 1C (GPSC = 0.73 nm per supercycle, corresponding to 4 DEZcycles). The water dose (Fig. 2c) showed a gradual increase inGPSC, which is typical of water doses.125 Purge times of 5 s werenecessary to remove the volatile reaction products and theexcess precursor (Fig. 2b and d). These dosing/purging timesfor the B doping process (i.e. TIB and DI-H2O doses of 50 msseparated by purge steps of 5 s) were used for all furtherexperiments.The reduction in GSPC with increasing TIB dose observed inFig. 2a could be the result of a slight etching of the ZnO by theTIB (as observed for TMA36,69,72) but it could also be due to theinhibition of ZnO growth after a TIB pulse, as observed forDMAI.36 To establish which effect played a role, an experimentwas carried out in which the film growth after every cycle (eitherDEZ or TIB cycle) was monitored by spectroscopic ellipsometry.Fig. S1 of the ESI shows the change in thickness as a functionof the number of cycles deduced from the measurementsobtained using the procedure described by Langereis et al.123Although the thickness values should be interpreted with somecare, it is clear that the ZnO was not etched by TIB (i.e., the filmthickness did not decrease after one B cycle) but that the TIBpulse led to an inhibition in the subsequent ZnO film growth.This growth inhibition took place during several cycles followingthe TIB pulse, and could also be seen from a second experimentin which a supercycle with m = 19 was used (i.e., a total of20 cycles comprising 19 ZnO + 1 TIB) (see Fig. S1, ESI). Fromthis experiment, it was evident that one TIB pulse affected theZnO during many cycles.RBS and PIGE analysis of the B-doped ZnO films wasconsistent with the drop in GPSC observed by in situ spectro-scopic ellipsometry. The data presented in Table 3 show thatapproximately 2.7 at per nm2 B and 5.8 at per nm2 Zn weredeposited in each individual respective cycle in a supercyclewith m = 4. The number of Zn atoms deposited in this super-cycle is therefore overall lower than expected for four cycles ofthe intrinsic ZnO process, which led to 7.1 at per nm2 Zndeposited per individual cycle of intrinsic ZnO. Furthermore,the number of Zn atoms deposited per individual cycle of ZnOis higher than this value when employing a supercycle withm = 19. Similar observations can be noted for ZnO:Al whenusing DMAI or TMA as the doping precursor (see Table 3).In order to investigate the dopant adsorption, the B dopingfraction (DF) was studied at 150 1C as a function of the dopantALD cycle fraction Rx = (1/(m + 1)), where m was varied from 3 to 40.The DF was assessed using XPS, where the sensitivity factors for Aland B were calibrated by RBS/PIGE. We benchmarked the devel-oped process with the ZnO:Al ALD processes using DMAI and TMAas alternative and conventional sources of Al, respectively. No Cimpurities were detected within the ZnO:X (X = Al, B) films by RBSand XPS above the detection limit of these methods. Only adven-titious C was observed on the surface of the films by XPS. Theincorporation of doping elements was the lowest in the case ofthe TIB and the greatest in the case of TMA for a given cycle ratiom (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with the data obtained by RBS/PIGEanalysis, where the areal densities of B or Al per cycle were, onaverage, B3.2 at per nm2 per supercycle (TIB), B4.4 at per nm2 persupercycle (DMAI) and B9.0 at per nm2 per supercycle (TMA)Fig. 2 Saturation curves of the ZnO:B process (m = 4) at 150 1C.

A combination of precursor reactivity and moleculesize is most likely the cause of this trend. The bulkier isopropylligands in the TIB and DMAI precursors are likely to cause sterichindrance on the film surface, resulting in a more sparse distribu-tion of the dopants on the surface and therefore a lower dopingfraction.36 This is expected from the decreasing size of the mono-mers (TIB 4 DMAI 4 TMA). It is worth highlighting that thedoping concentrations do not relate directly to the doping effi-ciency, as some of the doping material might have formed metaloxide or alloy clusters (e.g. Al2O3) rather than merely doping thefilm. In this case, the dopant atoms do not contribute donating anyelectrons to the ZnO film, as will be discussed in Section 4.2.4.2. Electrical propertiesThe electrical properties of the 45  5 nm-thick ZnO:B filmsdeposited on glass substrates at a temperature of 150 1C arepresented in Fig. 4. The addition of a small amount of B sharplyreduced the resistivity of the films to a minimum of B3.5 mO cmfor a DF of 0.016 (Fig. 4a). The films were benchmarked withZnO:Al films of the same thickness and deposited at the sametemperature using DMAI and TMA as Al precursors. The additionof Al also reduced the resistivity of the films to a minimum in bothcases. Doping with DMAI resulted in ZnO:Al films with the sameminimum resistivity than ZnO:B films at the same DF of 0.016,while doping with TMA resulted in ZnO:Al films with a higherminimum resistivity of 8 mO cm for a higher DF of 0.040. Theresistivity of ZnO:Al films increased in both cases after achievingthe minimum resistivity value, but this increase was more gradualthan observed for the ZnO:B films.The carrier concentration extracted from the modelling ofthe SE data assuming an effective mass of 0.4 (Fig. 4b) wasconsistent with the carrier concentration obtained by Hallmeasurements (not shown). The carrier concentration increasedwith the addition of B until a maximum of 3.1  1020 cm3 for aDF of 0.034 was achieved, after which the carrier concentrationdecreased abruptly. This trend is consistent with previous reportsin the literature for ZnO:B layers deposited by chemical spraypyrolysis.126 In the case of ZnO:Al films doped with DMAI, thecarrier concentration reached a maximum value of 2.6 1020 cm3for a DF of 0.016, before gradually decreasing to a value of B2.2 1020 cm3 for higher doping fractions. For ZnO:Al films doped withTMA, the carrier concentration reached a maximum value ofB1.4  1020 cm3, which did not vary significantly at higher DFvalues than 0.06. Based on literature reports,60,68 it is expected thatthe carrier concentration will decrease abruptly for higher Aldoping concentrations than those studied in this work. Theincrease of the carrier concentration for low doping fractions inthe three cases can be assigned to the effective doping of B and Al,respectively (i.e., substitution of Zn2+ by B3+ or Al3+). The sharpdecrease of the carrier concentration for TIB and the local satura-tion for DMAI and TMA might occur as a result of dopantoccupying interstitial sites, dopant clustering, formation of oxides,or formation of metastable phases, making dopant inactive,60,126which is possibly related to reaching the solubility limit of the B andAl into the ZnO lattice. For low doping fractions, the maximummobility value for the ZnO:B films (i.e., 11.4 cm2 V1 s1) was57% higher at low doping fractions relative to the maximumvalues determined for the ZnO:Al films. Based on the Masettimodel for ionized impurity scattering,127,128 a mobility as high as42 cm2 V1 s1 would be expected for the maximum carrierconcentration of 3.1  1020 cm3 in this work (ZnO:B film withDF = 0.034). Therefore, the overall lower values obtained for theTable 3 Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and Proton-Induced Gamma Ray Emission (PIGE) data of selected ZnO : X films deposited at150 1CSampleDopingprecursorCycle ratioZnO : XDopant ALD cyclefraction, RxDoping fraction byRBS/PIGE, DFDopant areal density (at per nm2)per dopant cycleaZn areal density (at per nm2)per ZnO cycleaZnO:B TIB 19 : 1 0.05 0.024  0.002 3.6  0.1 7.7  0.2ZnO:B TIB 5 : 1 0.17 0.085  0.009 2.7  0.1 5.8  0.1ZnO:Al DMAI 18 : 1 0.05 0.032  0.003 4.5  0.2 7.6  0.2ZnO:Al DMAI 9 : 1 0.10 0.065  0.007 4.3  0.2 6.9  0.1ZnO:Al TMA 17 : 1 0.06 0.064  0.007 8.0  0.3 6.9  0.1ZnO:Al TMA 8 : 1 0.11 0.17  0.02 10.0  0.4 5.9  0.1ZnO      7.1  0.2a Note that the dopant areal density per supercycle is equal to the dopant areal density per dop
