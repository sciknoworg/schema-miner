Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven,The NetherlandsReceived 18 August 2008; accepted 5 October 2009; published 18 December 2009In this note it is demonstrated that optical emission spectroscopy OES is an easy-to-implement andvaluable tool to study, optimize, and monitor thin film growth by plasma-assisted atomic layerdeposition ALD. The species in the plasma can be identified through the analysis of the lightemitted by the plasma. OES provides therefore information on the reactant species delivered to thesurface by the plasma but it also yields unique insight into the surface reaction products and, as aconsequence, on the reaction mechanisms of the deposition process. Time-resolved measurementsreveal information about the amount of precursor dosing and length of plasma exposure needed tosaturate the self-limiting half reactions, which is useful for the optimization of the ALD process.Furthermore, time-resolved OES can also be used as an easy-to-implement process monitoring toolfor plasma-assisted ALD processes on production equipment; for example, to monitor reactor wallconditions or to detect process faults in real time. © 2010 American Vacuum Society.DOI: 10.1116/1.3256227I. INTRODUCTIONAtomic layer deposition ALD is considered the methodof choice for the deposition of ultrathin high-quality filmsdue to its unique features such as precise growth control,excellent conformality on substrates with demanding topolo-gies, and processing at relatively low thermal budget.1 Atrend that started half a decade ago and that is currentlygaining more momentum is the introduction of a plasma stepin the ALD process. This so-called plasma-enhanced orplasma-assisted ALD process has several potential advan-tages compared to the purely thermally driven process, oftenreferred to as thermal ALD. For some emerging applica-tions of ultrathin films, merits of plasma-assisted ALD suchas the deposition at reduced temperatures, improved materialproperties, increased choice of precursors and materials, andmore process versatility might become of key importance.To be able to exploit the merits of the plasma-assistedALD technique it is of great value to gain an in-depth under-standing of the underlying mechanisms of the plasma-assisted ALD processes. Plasma-assisted ALD of a large setof materials has already been reported, however, many ques-tions about the reaction mechanisms that rule the surfacechemistry and the resulting film and device properties stillremain unanswered. Moreover, with plasma-assisted ALDgradually developing to research and development R&Dand industrial applications, there is a need for process moni-toring tools and process control tools which are dedicated tothe plasma-based process. The aforementioned issues can betackled by the implementation of in situ diagnostic tech-niques: in situ studies are of key importance for elucidatingthe reaction mechanisms of plasma-assisted ALD, and, ifeasy to implement, the techniques can also serve as processaElectronic mail: w.m.m.kessels@tue.nl77 J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 281, Jan/Feb 2010 0734-2101/2010monitoring tools when plasma-assisted ALD is scaled up toproduction.Some diagnostic techniques have already been introducedas process monitoring tools to study plasma-assisted ALD,such as quadrupole mass spectroscopy,24 quartz crystal mi-crobalance measurements,3,5,6 and in situ spectroscopicellipsometry.3,4,711 Because in plasma-assisted ALD one ofthe two main steps is the exposure of the surface to a plasmafor surface ligand exchange, the unique possibility exist tostudy the light emitted by the plasma. This plasma emissioncontains information about the species present in the plasmaand with the method of optical emission spectroscopy OESreactant species delivered to the surface by the plasma can beidentified. In the recent years, OES has been employed forthis purpose in plasma-assisted ALD processes by severalauthors.1217 OES can, however, not only be used to studythe electronically excited species delivered to the surfaceduring the plasma half-reaction, OES can also provide infor-mation on the precursor half-reaction and the overall processperformance.The aim of this note is to show that OES is a versatiletechnique to study, optimize, and monitor plasma-assistedALD processes. Based on our recently reported studies ofplasma-assisted ALD of the metal oxides Al2O3 Refs. 3 and18 and Ta2O5 Ref. 4 and metal nitrides TaN Ref. 10 andTiN Ref. 16 we will demonstrate that OES can provideunique insight into the surface reaction products and there-fore on the reaction mechanisms of the deposition process.Since time-resolved OES can reveal information about thesaturation of the two half reactions, it is also possible tooptimize half reaction times by OES. This is helpful to de-crease precursor consumption and to increase wafer through-put. Finally, we will show that OES is an easy-to-implementtechnique for process monitoring and process control on77/281/77/11/$30.00 ©2010 American Vacuum Society78 Mackus et al.: OES as a tool for studying, optimizing, and monitoring plasma-assisted ALD processes 78plasma-assisted ALD equipment used for production. Forprocess monitoring and control it is important that OES has arelatively low detection limit and fast response time. Smalldensities of excited species and/or small changes in theplasma properties can be probed by OES, whereas othertechniques are often not sufficiently sensitive. OES is there-fore well suited to monitor several aspects of the depositionprocess, such as plasma source operation, adequacy of purg-ing, reactor wall conditioning, etc.In the following sections, the abovementioned possibili-ties provided by OES will be illustrated by several examplesfrom our recent studies obtained at two plasma-assisted ALDreactors. It is not the intention to give a complete and de-tailed review of the method and its results; we rather want todemonstrate to the nonplasma specialist reader that veryvaluable information can easily be obtained by the OESmethod. We start therefore with a brief review of the verybasics of OES in Sec. II, after which some experimentaldetails will be presented Sec. III. In Sec. IV, emission spec-tra of several plasmas typically employed in plasma-assistedALD will first be treated with the most prominent emissionlines identified. Although specific for the particular plasmasstudied, the results should form a good starting point whenother plasma configurations and other plasma conditions areconsidered. Subsequently, examples of OES results will bepresented for a variety of plasma-assisted ALD processesAl2O3, Ta2O5, TaN, TiN to illustrate the possibilities ofOES for studying reaction mechanisms and optimizing ALDcycles. In addition, the feasibility of using OES as a processmonitoring tool will be evaluated.II. OPTICAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPYOES exploits the fact that a plasma emits light. Emissionlines in an emission spectrum originate from the decay ofelectronically excited states of the atoms and moleculeswhich are present in the reactor. These excited states are inmost cases created through collisions between plasma spe-cies with electrons, for example, through electron-impact ex-citation, ionization, or dissociation reactions. Radiatingatomic, ionic, and molecular species can therefore reveal in-formation on the species present in the plasma and conse-quently also about the reactions that take place in the gasphase and at the surface of the reactor or film deposited. Theexistence of particular emission lines in the emission spec-trum indicates the presence of particular species in theplasma, i.e., the emission lines can act as a fingerprint ofexcited species. We note, however, that it cannot be con-cluded that certain species are absent in the plasma whentheir emission lines are not observed. Whether species radi-ate depends on whether the species are excited in the plasmaand therefore details of the plasma kinetics as well as detailsof the electronic structure and radiative properties of the spe-cies are important.Considering the basics of OES, in an ionizing plasma theexcitation of species takes place predominantly by electronimpact. Species are excited from level q to level p which cansubsequently be followed by the decay of the species intolevel k by spontaneous emission. Consequently, the wave-J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 28, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2010length  of an emission line is determined by the photonenergy corresponding to the transition of level p with energyEp to level k with energy Ek, =hcEp ? Ek, 1with h and c Plancks constant and the speed of light, respec-tively. The emission intensity in terms of number of photonsm?3 s?1 is characterized by the product of the transitionprobability or Einstein coefficient Ak of a spontaneous emis-sion process and the population density of the excited levelnp,Ipk = npApk. 2This means that the emission intensity is proportional to thedensity of electronically excited species. In an OES measure-ment this proportionality holds in the case that self-absorption can be neglected.19 Furthermore, also geometricalaspects and specifications of the detection system need to betaken into account. Examples are the possible absorption oflight by the window material and the fact that the measure-ment is a line-of-sight measurement.In most cases the emission intensity is also a measure ofthe density of the ground state species. The latter, however,only holds when the excited state is predominantly populatedthrough excitations from the ground state, referred to as theso-called Corona balance, which is generally the case in ion-izing plasmas. Moreover, the intensity of a certain emissionline can only be directly related to the density of a certainground state species when one particular excitation channelis present or by far dominant. However, in several casesthere exist several excitation channels, for example, involv-ing both atomic and molecular species in the plasma, that cancontribute to the population of an excited state. It should alsobe noted that the fraction of the plasma species which areelectronically excited in an ionizing plasma is determined bythe electron energy distribution function of the plasma, re-sulting in a dependence of the emission intensity on both thedensity of the plasma species and the energy distributionfunction of the electrons. Since both can change when theplasma conditions are varied i.e., actively varied or alteredby indirect means, the change in density of plasma speciescannot be determined straightforwardly from optical emis-sion signals. This problem can be solved by using themethod of actinometry as developed by Coburn and Chen.20More detailed theory of OES can be found in Refs. 2123and references therein.III. EXPERIMENTALThe OES measurements were carried out on two plasma-assisted ALD reactors which can be classified as remoteplasma reactors because the plasma is created upstream andindependently from the substrate stage.24 Both reactors havebeen described in detail previously, the home-built ALD-Ireactor in Ref. 16 and the commercially available FlexALreactor Oxford Instruments in Ref. 24. The FlexAL reactoris schematically represented in Fig. 1a. Briefly, both reac-79 Mackus et al.: OES as a tool for studying, optimizing, and monitoring plasma-assisted ALD processes 79tors consist of a process chamber connected to an inductivelycoupled plasma ICP source, a precursor dosing unit, and apump unit. The plasma source can be operated on plasmagases such as H2, N2, O2, and NH3 or mixtures thereof. Theplasma conditions typically employed are plasma powerswithin the range of 100400 W, gas flows of 3060 sccmsccm denotes cubic centimeter per minute at STP, andpressures between 7.5 and 15 mTorr. The precursors can bedelivered into the process chamber by either releasing atrapped volume or by opening the precursor valve for a cer-tain precursor dosing time.The light emission from the plasma is collected by aquartz optical fiber which is coupled to an Ocean OpticsUSB4000 spectrometer. This spectrometer, depicted in Fig.FIG. 1.

The optical emission signalcan either be obtained at the top of the plasma source as indicated in thefigure or in the downstream region. b Photograph of the upper part of theFlexAL reactor showing the ICP plasma source, the top of the chamber, andthe gate valve in between the chamber and the plasma source. The OESspectrometer Ocean Optics USB4000, bottom left is connected with anoptical fiber to a window installed on a vacuum port in the downstreamregion.1b, has a wavelength detection range of 2001100 nm andJVST A - Vacuum, Surfaces, and Filmsa resolution of approximately 1 nm. In most experiments onthe FlexAL reactor the quartz fiber is placed in front of aquartz window installed at the top of the plasma source asdepicted in Fig. 1a. This configuration results in a line-of-sight measurement through the plasma source into the depo-sition chamber. The quartz window mainly transmits light inthe wavelength range of 250850 nm. Deposition of thinfilm material on this window is negligible because the valvebetween the deposition chamber and the plasma source isclosed during the precursor exposure step for most ALD pro-cesses. The optical fiber can also be placed in front of awindow installed on a vacuum port in the downstream regionof the reactor, as shown in Fig. 1b. This position samplesthe downstream plasma and is expected to give preferentialinformation on the excited reaction product species. On theother hand, the plasma is less intense at this position and theopening angle of the vacuum port is small reducing the emis-sion intensities detected. Furthermore, thin film material willbe deposited at this window and therefore the optical trans-mission of this window should be closely monitored overtime. Measurements on the ALD-I reactor have been carriedout in the downstream region through glass and quartz win-dows positioned in the reactor chamber. The fiber probeslight emitted by the plasma at the position of the substratestage. For the ALD-I reactor it is also possible to detect thelight emission in the plasma source region by positioning thequartz fiber in front of the quartz tube used to generate theinductively coupled plasma.Several plasma-assisted ALD deposition processes havebeen investigated by OES measurements and will be re-ported on in this note. An overview of the ALD processes isgiven in Table I, which summarizes the ALD reactants forthe different processes and the reactor on which the experi-ments have been carried out.IV. RESULTSA.

The most important spectral features have been ithat a certain excited species might be created by severalJ. Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 28, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2010ionization, dissociation, and excitation reactions. For ex-ample, excited atomic oxygen can be produced by the directelectron-impact excitation of atomic oxygen in the groundstate or by the process of dissociative excitation of molecularoxygen. This, in combination with the large number of reac-tions that take place in the plasma, clearly illustrates thatpinpointing the excitation mechanisms leading to particularemission lines is rather complex.The identification of emission lines in a measured OESspectrum can be fairly complicated depending on the reso-lution of the spectrometer. This is due to uncertainty in thec a N2 plasma, d a plasma from a H2N2 10:1 mixture, and e a NH3rs, gas flows, and pressures in the range of 100400 W, 3060 SCCM, andfied in the figures. Some of the emission lines in the figures are in saturation.sma,powedentiwavelength value of an emission line and due to the fact that81 Mackus et al.: OES as a tool for studying, optimizing, and monitoring plasma-assisted ALD processes 81in the wavelength range around a data point, as defined bythe spectrometers resolution, there are generally a numberof spectral lines which can be related to the species presentin the reactor. The identification of the emission lines is fa-cilitated by keeping some rules of thumb in mind. The pres-ence of a particular line in the emission spectrum implies inmost cases also the presence of other related emission linesbelonging to the same emission system. For example, in Fig.2a several emission lines of the O2+ first negative systemare observed. The presence of the combination of these emis-sion lines strongly suggests identifying the lines as O2+ emis-sion. In addition, when considering time-resolved measure-ments, the emission lines of one system generally show asimilar time-evolution providing that the electron tempera-ture does not change significantly over the measurementtime. If one of the lines evolves very differently, it can there-fore be assumed that the signal consists of overlapping linesof different species.The spectrum of a H2 plasma depicted in Fig. 2b canmainly be characterized by intense atomic hydrogen linesH ,H ,H and the Fulcher band d3u?a 3g+,590630 nm. The N2 plasma spectrum shown in Fig. 2c isdominated by the first B 3g?A 3u+ and second C 3u?B 3g positive system of molecular nitrogen. Emissionby excited N atoms cannot be distinguished as is also gener-ally the case under typical plasma conditions employed dueto high excitation energies involved. This does not excludethe presence of a high density of N atoms in the plasma. InFig. 2d, the emission spectrum from a plasma generated ina H2N2 mixture ratio H2:N2 is 10:1 is a combination ofthe spectra of H2 and N2 plasmas as indicated by the intenseatomic hydrogen lines, the Fulcher band, and the N2 first andsecond positive systems.

Studying reaction products and reactionmechanismsWhen studying the plasma half reaction of a plasma-assisted ALD process by optical emission spectroscopy, itcan be observed that the plasma emission initially changesover time before steady state is reached. See, for example,Fig. 3. When the precursor exposure step has preceded theplasma exposure step, the optical emission signals at the startof the plasma step are remarkably different from a plasmaexposure step which is not related to an ALD cycle e.g., justby switching the plasma on and off. The behavior distin-guishes itself from typical plasma start-up effects by the factFIG. 3. Color online a Emission spectrum from a steady-state O2 plasmaand a spectrum of an O2 plasma exposure during a plasma-assisted ALDcycle of Al2O3. The latter spectrum was recorded after an AlCH33 dosingstep during the first 200 ms of plasma exposure, whereas the steady-state O2plasma spectrum was recorded well after the plasma half-reaction reachedsaturation. b Time-resolved intensities of emission lines related to plasmaspecies and reaction products after an AlCH33 dose had preceded. Theplasma was ignited at time t= 0.5 s.that the initial change over time is much more prominent82 Mackus et al.: OES as a tool for studying, optimizing, and monitoring plasma-assisted ALD processes 82than when the plasma is switched on without preceding pre-cursor exposure. This difference in plasma emission resultsfrom the reactions at the surface that are initiated by theplasma species. When delivered to the surface these reactantspecies react with the precursor fragments adsorbed at thesurface during the precursor dosing step. Volatile reactionproducts are released from the surface into the plasma andwhen excited by, e.g., electron impact, the reaction productsprovide additional optical emission at certain wavelengths.This additional emission yields information about the kind ofreaction products created at the start of the plasma exposureand consequently about the surface reactions. Moreover, con-sumption of reactant species in the plasma by these surfacereactions can be observed by a reduced optical emission in-tensity at wavelengths that correspond to the plasma reactantspecies itself. At the end of the plasma step when the surfacereactions have saturated, the emission spectrum recordedduring a plasma-assisted ALD cycle resembles the spectrumof the steady-state plasma.The effect described has clearly been observed during theplasma-assisted ALD process of metal oxides employingmetal-organic precursors and O2 plasma as oxidant source.Figure 3 shows the results obtained for plasma-assisted ALDof Al2O3 with AlCH33 as precursor. In Fig. 3a the emis-sion spectrum from an O2 plasma ignited after precedingAlCH33 precursor dosing, as recorded within the first200 ms after plasma ignition, is compared to the emissionspectrum from a steady-state O2 plasma similar to the spec-trum in Fig. 2a. The spectra in Fig. 3a are clearly differ-ent; the spectrum recorded during the plasma-assisted ALDcycle contains many more emission lines. From a detailedanalysis of the spectrum it has been deduced that the broademission band can be attributed to excited CO molecules.Furthermore, an intense OH band at 309 nm is observed aswell as emission lines from the Balmer series of atomic H.As mentioned this difference in emission between the twospectra can be explained by the excitation of reaction prod-ucts released from the surface at the start of the plasma ex-posure. The difference disappears when the surface reactionsreach saturation. As has been discussed in our previous work,the excited CO and OH molecules and excited H atoms areformed as a result of electron-impact dissociative excitationof CO, CO2, H2O, and CH4 reaction products created at thesurface during plasma-assisted ALD of Al2O3 by combus-tionlike reactions.3,18In order to obtain information about the surface reactionsand to study the time dependence involved, it can be helpfulto measure the optical emission intensities at certain wave-lengths as a function of time. Such measurements are gener-ally more illustrative than the comparison of full spectra. Thewavelengths measured can be selected such that they corre-spond to emission lines by plasma reactant species and ex-pected reaction products. Figure 3b shows time-resolvedemission signals of relevant emission lines recorded duringthe plasma half reaction of the Al2O3 ALD process. Initiallythere is a rapid increase in the intensity of the CO, OH, andH emission lines due to the surface reactions taking place.J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 28, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2010Subsequently, the intensities of these emission lines decreasedue to the reduction in the amount of ligands present at thesurface as caused by the progression of the surface reactions.Finally, when all surface ligands have been oxidized by theO2 plasma species, stable plasma emission intensities arereached with a similar fingerprint as an O2 plasma in steadystate. During the plasma half-cycle, the consumption of re-actant species in the O2 plasma can be observed by the de-creased emission intensities of the oxygen species at theplasma start up. During the plasma exposure these emissionintensities gradually increase and finally reach again theirsteady-state values. The change of the emission during theplasma step of plasma-assisted ALD of Al2O3 can even beobserved by the naked eye as a blue to green transition orblue flash.18,33 These measurements as well as other in situstudies of the reaction mechanism of plasma-assisted ALD ofAl2O3 are discussed in more detail in our previous work.3,18For plasma-assisted ALD of Ta2O5 from theTaNCH325 precursor and O2 plasma a similar effect hasbeen observed.4 In Fig. 4a the emission spectrum from anO2 plasma ignited after preceding TaNCH325 precursordose, as recorded in the first 200 ms after plasma ignition, iscompared to the emission spectrum from a steady-state O2plasma. Similar emission lines as for the Al2O3 case are ob-served indicating that combustionlike reactions also rule theplasma half-reaction for plasma-assisted ALD of Ta2O5. Theconsumption of the reactant species in the O2 plasma is againobserved. Different is, however, that also CN emission at388 nm from excited CwN is observed at the start of theplasma exposure step. This difference is due to the use of thealkylamide precursor instead of the alkyl precursor in theAl2O3 case. The presence of CN emission suggests that TaNbonds are broken during the oxidation of the film and itssurface groups. Figure 4b shows the emission intensities atselected wavelengths as recorded by time-resolved OESmeasurements. The intense CO emission due to electron-impact dissociative excitation of CO and CO2 reactionproducts can again be observed by the naked eye as a blueflash, similar to the emission during the deposition of Al2O3as discussed above.In Fig. 5, emission spectra and time-resolved emissionintensities recorded during the plasma-assisted ALD processof TaN are shown. The metal nitride film was deposited fromthe TaNCH325 precursor and H2 plasma as reported inRef. 10. The emission spectra recorded during the plasma-assisted ALD cycle within the first 200 ms of plasma expo-sure are very similar to the emission spectrum from asteady-state H2 plasma. A difference can, however, be ob-served around 388 nm where again the emission band is vis-ible that can be attributed to the radiative decay of excitedCN molecules. The presence of CN emission during theplasma-assisted ALD cycles when employing a H2 plasmasuggests that TaN bonds of the TaNCH325 surfaceligands are broken by the reactant species in the H2 plasma.The increased emission at 388 nm during the ALD cycle canalso be observed in the time-resolved measurements asshown in Fig. 5b. The CN emission during the cycle is83 Mackus et al.: OES as a tool for studying, optimizing, and monitoring plasma-assisted ALD processes 83superimposed on the emission intensity from other emissionlines in the H2 plasma. This measurement illustrates thatOES can give insight into the chemistry of the depositionprocess since it provides insight into which bonds are brokenin the surface ligands during plasma exposure. A more de-tailed description of this experiment can be found in ourprevious work.10These examples illustrate that OES measurements and es-pecially time-resolved OES measurements can be used toobtain information about the reaction products released dur-ing the plasma half-reaction of plasma-assisted ALD. Theobservations are most obvious during the deposition of metaloxides, however, also during the deposition of metal nitridesand presumably also during the deposition of metals similarobservations can be made. Studies by OES help therefore tocome to an understanding of the reaction mechanisms ofFIG. 4.
