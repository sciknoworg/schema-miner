In this letter, we report on increased tunability of Ba 3 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO ( BST ) thin films by use of Ta O 2 5 and TiO2 films as buffer layers between BST and Si substrates. Ta nd TiO 2 2 O 5 a buffer layers were grown by atomic layer deposition LD ( A ) onto Si substrates followed by pulsed laser deposition of Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO 3 thin films onto the buffer layers. The randomly oriented BST films deposited on TiO 2 /Si substrates exhibited a broader grain size distribution than thered BST films ( 110 ) textu grown on Ta 2 O 5 /Si substrates. At an applied voltage of 10 V, the BST films grown on Ta i and 2 O 5 /S TiO 2 /Si substrates showed much enhanced tunability values of 53.1% and 72.9%, respectively, as compared to the 20.7% value obtained with BST films grown on MgO single crystal substrates. Successful integration of BST low voltage microwave tunable devices onto Si substrates thus appears possible with the aid of ALD grown Ta 2 O 5 or TiO2 buffer layers. © 2004 American Institute of Physics .
