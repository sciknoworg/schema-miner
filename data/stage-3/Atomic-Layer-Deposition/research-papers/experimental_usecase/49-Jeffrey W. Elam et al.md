## Introduction

Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conducting oxide material with a wide range of uses. Thin films of ITO are used in transparent electrodes for flat panel displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. ITO is also used as a heat-reflecting layer to improve the energy efficiency of architectural glass. ITO thin films can be deposited in a variety of ways including sputtering, pray pyrolysis, ol gel methods,chemical vapor 1 s 2 s -3 deposition,ulsed laser deposition, atomic layer deposition 4 p 5 a d (ALD). 6 -8 ALD is a thin film growth method utilizing alternating, self-limiting chemical reactions between gaseous precursors and a solid surface to deposit materials in an atomic layer-bylayer fashion.his method can produce films with exquisite 9 T control over thickness and composition and allows coatings to be applied on all exposed surfaces of nanoporous substrates such as aerogels mesoporous membranes. 1,12 10 or 1

precise metal oxide coatings onto porous supports such as anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes to synthesize dye-sensitized solar cells. As part of this effort, we have developed new 14 methods for depositing ALD In 3 2 O films using alternating exposures to cyclopentadienyl indium (InCp) and ozone 15 and also SnO2 films using alternating exposures to tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (TDMASn) and H 2 O 2. 16 In this article, demonstrate how the ALD procedures for In 3 2 O and SnO 2 can be combined to make ITO thin films. We use in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) measurements to investigate the ALD growth mechanism. ITO films are deposited onto Si(100) and glass substrates and examined using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), optical transmittance, four-point probe and Hall probe measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Finally, we demonstrate that these methods are capable of conformally coating very high aspect ratio AAO membranes suitable for solar cell electrodes.

## Experimental Section

ALD ITO films have been prepared previously using InCl 3 , SnCl4, and either H 2 O 7 or H2O 2 8 as the oxygen source. However, this method suffers from limitations including low growth rates, high deposition temperatures, low volatility of InCl he 3 , and t inconvenience of using halogenated precursors. The chlorinated precursors as well as the HCl byproduct are corrosive and can etch the substrates and damage the deposition equipment. For instance, large exposures to InCletch the deposited In . 3 can 2 O 3 6 This behavior is especially problematic when trying to infiltrate porous substrates where large reactant exposures are needed to ensure diffusion throughout the substrate.ly, halogenated 12 Final precursors can form agglomerates during large exposures, leading to nonuniform deposits. 13

The ALD experiments used a viscous flow reactoron17 c structed from a circular, stainless steel flow tube with an inside diameter of 5 cm to hold the substrates for film growth as well as the QCM. Ultrahigh purity (99.999%) nitrogen carrier gas continuously passed through the flow tube at a mass flow rate of 360 sccm and a pressure of 1 Torr. A constant reactor temperature was maintained by temperature controllers connected to resistive heaters attached to the outside of the reactor. Four separate heating zones were used to establish a uniform temperature profile along the length of the flow tube to minimize artifacts caused by temperature transients during the measurements. 8 1

SnO 2 ALD was performed using alternating exposures to TDMASn (Gelest, &gt; 95% purity) and hydrogen peroxide (H2, 2 O Aldrich, 50 wt % in water). In ALD was performed using 2 O 3 alternating exposures to InCp (Strem, electronic grade 99.999 + % In) and ozone. The ozone was produced using a commercial ozone generator (Ozone Engineering L11) using a feed of ultrahigh purity oxygen at a flow rate of 400 sccm to produce GLYPH&lt;24&gt; 10% ozone in oxygen. The TDMASn and InCp were held in separate stainless steel bubblers maintained at 40the GLYPH&lt;176&gt; C, and tubing connecting the bubblers to the ALD reactor was heated to 150 GLYPH&lt;176&gt; C to prevent condensation of the precursors on the reactor walls. Ultrahigh purity nitrogen at a mass flow rate of 60 sccm was sent through the bubblers during the reactant exposures and was diverted to bypass the bubblers following the reactant exposures.

The ALD timing sequences can be expressed as t 1 - - -t 2 t 3 t 4 where t 1 is the exposure time for the first precursor, e t 2 is th purge time following the first exposure, the exposure time t 3 is for the second precursor, ands the purge time following the t 4 i exposure to the second precursor with units in seconds. On the 2 O 3 ALD was 2 - - -4 2 2, and the timing sequence used for SnO 2 ALD was 1 - - -5 1 5. ITO ALD was accomplished by alternating between the InCp/O cycles 3 for In3 2 O ALD and the TDMASn/H 2 O 2 cycles for SnOALD. The composition of the 2 films was controlled by adjusting the percentage of SnO es 2 cycl that were substituted for Inycles. 2 O 3 c

To enable in situ measurements during the ITO ALD, a QCM was installed in the ALD reactor in place of the substrates. These all effect measurement system (Ecopia HMS-3000). studies utilized a Maxtek BSH-150 bakeable sensor, AT-cut quartz sensor crystals with a polished front surface (Colorado ts ED2000 to determine the Sn and In contents of the ALD Crystal Corporation, part no. CCAT1BK-1007-000), and a Maxtek TM400 film thickness monitor interfaced to a personal and In 2O 3 computer. The ALD reactor was also equipped with a QMS (Stanford Research Systems RGA300) located downstream of the QCM in a differentially pumped chamber separated from were measured by XRF. By plotting the XRF signals for Sn the reactor tube by a 35-orifice and evacuated using a 50 GLYPH&lt;237&gt; m L/s turbomolecular pump. an ultrasonicator using acetone and then 2-propanol and blown asurements performed on the ITO films, and the Sn and In dry using nitrogen. After loading, the substrates were allowed tents were calculated using the known atomic densities of XRF measurements were performed using an Oxford Instrumen ITO films. To calibrate the XRF signals, a series of pure SnO 2 films were prepared on Si(100) substrates and the thicknesses of these films were determined using VASE measurements. Next, the Sn and In signals from these films and In versus the corresponding SnO nd In 2O 3 2 a film thicknesses measured using VASE, we obtained the calibration factors (XRF counts/Å) for Sn and In. These calibration factors were used to extra 2 and from XRF me con t purity nitrogen. Next, the substrates were cleaned in situ using O to evaluate the suitability of the new ALD ITO technique a 60-s exposure to 10% ozone in oxygen at a pressure of 2 to conformally coat porous materials. The AAO membranes had different AAO membranes (Whatman Anodisc 13) were also coated by IT a thickness of 70m and a pore diameter GLYPH&lt;237&gt; d ) 200 nm across most of the membrane thickness which transitioned to a 1 -2GLYPH&lt;237&gt; m thick layer with d ) 20 nm pores. Cross-sectional SEM analysis was performed on cleaved specimens of the coated AAO membranes.

In our previous study of In ALD, we observed a reactor 2 O 3 conditioning effect in which the thicknesses of Inms 2 O 3 fil deposited immediately following the growth of a material, such as Al 3 2 O or SnO2, were thinner than expected. 15 To compensate for this effect, we always deposited an In 2 O 3 buffer layer on the inside of the reactor using InCp/O3 GLYPH&lt;24&gt; 100 cycles following deposition of a different material. depositing this buffer layer, we proceeded with the deposition experiments.

A series of ITO films were prepared on Si(100) using 300 ALD cycles at 275 GLYPH&lt;176&gt; C in which the percentage of SnO 2 cycles was varied between 0 and 25%. The total thicknesses of these films were determined using VASE measurements, and the effective thicknesses of SnO In 2O 3 2 a d for the films were calculated from XRF measurements using the calibration procedure described in the Experimental Section. The ITO growth rates determined from the VASE and XRF results are given by the circles and triangles, respectively, in Figure 2, and the solid line guides the eye. The ITO growth rate decreases steadily from 1.69 Å/cycle for 0% SnOo 1.07 Å/cycle for 2 t 25% SnO 2 . There is fairly good agreement between the VASE and XRF growth rate measurements for these ITO films. The dashed line in Figure 2 shows the anticipated ITO growth rates based on a rule-of-mixtures formula and reveals that measured growth rates are below the rule-of-mixture estimates for all of the ITO films.

The dashed line in Figure 3 shows the expected SnO content based on a rule2 of-mixtures formula. Over the entire range of SnO les, the 2 cyc SnO 2 content is higher than the predicted values.

This value is substantially larger than the growth rates of 0.20 /cycle -0.32 Å measured previously for the ALD of ITO using halogenated precursors. A more detailed examination of the thickness data 8 in Figure 6 reveals that the ITO growth rate increases slightly with the number of ALD cycles from 1.35 Å/cycle at 50 cycles to 1.65 Å/cycle at 1000 cycles. Gradual changes in ALD growth rates have been observed previously for nanocrystalline materials in which the morphology or crystal size evolves with film thickness. 19,20 15,

The filled circles in Figure 1 show the ITO growth rate versus the deposition temperature measured by VASE for films prepared using 300 cycles with 5% SnOcycles. 2 Figure 1 demonstrates that the experimentally determined temperature window for ITO ALD matches very closely with the temperature range predicted from the component oxides. In particular, the ITO growth rate remains nearly constant at 1.35 1 Å/cycle -1.5 in the temperature range 200 25 -3 GLYPH&lt;176&gt; C.

Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the SnOcles inhibit the 2 cy subsequent In O 3 2 ALD, and this may result from the suppression of O3 decomposition by the SnO .

The reduced In 3 2 O growth observed using QCM and QMS explains why the ITO films are thinner than expected (Figure 2), and also why the ITO films contain more using SnO 2 than expected (Figure 3).

## C. Fabrication of High Surface Area ITO. We used the be used in nanostructured photovoltaic spectrophotochemi14 or cal 4 2 applications. First, a thin ITO coating was deposited on a U.S. commercial AAO membrane that completely infiltrated AAO pores to create a conformal, uniform coating with thickness of 9.7 nm. This process used 58 ALD cycles with 10% SnO 2 cycles at a temperature of 275with the timing GLYPH&lt;176&gt; C sequence 12 10 --60 -5 for In O 2 3 and 10 -10 -10 -10 for SnO2. Next, the AAO was mounted in a fixture that limited deposition to the front, 20-nm pore side of the membrane, and an ITO film with a thickness of 161 nm was deposited. The function of this thick layer was to seal off the small pores and also to (4) Suzuki, A.; Maki, K. used 1000 cycles with 5% SnO 2 cycles at a temperature of 275 GLYPH&lt;176&gt; C with the timing sequence 2 4 - - -2 2 for InO 3 2 and 1 - - -5 1 5 for SnO2.

Cross-sectional SEM images of the resulting electrode are shown in Figure 13. Figure 13a demonstrates that the 20-nm pores of the membrane are completely sealed, while underlying 200-nm pores are still open beneath the thick coating.
