Property Merging:
None needed

Property Grouping:
None needed

Missing Properties:
1. Material that is etched
2. Temperature during the ALE process

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Remove the role of the reactants.
2. Remove the including these properties in the description for the etched Material properties. 
3. Also in the properties of the etched material, you can add even more: like crystallinity and other properties of this material mentioned in the paper. For the material composition also include the elements for the respective percentage in the composition.
