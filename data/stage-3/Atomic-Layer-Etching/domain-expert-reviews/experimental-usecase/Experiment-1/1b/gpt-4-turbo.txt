Property Merging:
None needed

Property Grouping:
1. Bring the material that is etched from the material properties group to the top of the schema
2. Put the characterization method under every property mentioned for the etched material. It corresponds to the characterization method used to measure this specific property.

Missing Properties:
None needed

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. The description of the ALE temperature window is quite long. Can be more concise.
2. In the description of the etchPerCycle rename layers to nanometers.
3. Also make sure that in the chemical composition the respective element is mentioned for every part of the composition in the film
4. Describe the process parameters as the Process parameters used during the ALE process.
