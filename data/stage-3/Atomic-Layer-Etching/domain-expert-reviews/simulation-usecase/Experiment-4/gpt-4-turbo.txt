Property Merging:
None needed

Property Grouping:
Need to ensure that all properties are from simulations, e.g., "filmProperties", and "designVariables" could come from larger-scale simulations

Missing Properties:
1. Simulation parameters should include a detailed description of the substrate being modelled, e.g., its dimensions, the unit cell used to create the model, surface orientation etc
2. Schema needs to include a detailed description of simulation methodology used, e.g., was it with DFT or monte-carlo, what functionals or basis sets were used, what was the MD timestep etc.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Need to ensure that all properties are from simulations, e.g., "filmProperties", and "designVariables" could come from larger-scale simulations, but do they in this case, or have these properties been extracted from experimental discussions?
