Property Merging:
The very specific process parameters properties should be merged into more generic categories to cover broader applications. E.g. a property relating to etchant usage rather than the specific chemical used in one case.

Property Grouping:
"outputs" and "simulationParameters" should be the same thing. Currently "outputs" focuses on experimental properties, this should be combined with "simulationParameters" as all results extracted by this schema should be from simulations only.

Missing Properties:
1. Simulation parameters should include a detailed description of the substrate being modelled, e.g., its dimensions, the unit cell used to create the model, surface orientation etc
2. Schema needs to include a detailed description of simulation methodology used, e.g., was it with DFT or monte-carlo, what functionals or basis sets were used, what was the MD timestep etc.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Need to ensure that all properties are from simulations, e.g., "filmProperties", and "designVariables" could come from larger-scale simulations
2. "amorphousHfO2" is too specific a property, it will only be applicable to a couple of papers and therefore shouldnâ€™t be included, or should be generalised to fit other similar studies
3. Reactant pulse properties may be useful but they will be very dependent on paper specific reporting, papers may just list them as precursors or etchants.
