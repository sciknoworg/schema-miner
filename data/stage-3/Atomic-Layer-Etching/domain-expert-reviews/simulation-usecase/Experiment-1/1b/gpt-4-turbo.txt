Property Merging:
"Outputs" and "simulationParameters" groups should be combined as they are both results based properties, and the whole schema should only be discussing results of simulation studies.

Property Grouping:
None needed

Missing Properties:
1. Inputs should include a detailed description of the substrate being modelled, e.g., its dimensions, the unit cell used to create the model, etc
2. Results properties should be expanded to allow for the extraction of string and numerical values, e.g. binding mechanism discussion 
3. Methodology needs further expansion to cover all aspects required for result replication.

Adequacy of Descriptions:
Need to ensure that all properties are from simulations, e.g., "filmProperties", and "designVariables" could come from larger-scale simulations
