Property Merging:
None needed

Property Grouping:
"outputs" and "simulationParameters" should be the same thing. Currently "outputs" focuses on experimental properties, this should be combined with "simulationParameters" as all results extracted by this schema should be from simulations or at least clearly marked as either simulation or experimental

Missing Properties:
1. Simulation methodology needs to be more detailed and broken into further sub-properties
2. There should be more detailed results properties, e.g. "decompositionMechanisms" could be broken up into decomposition and binding separately, and there could be string and numerical properties to extract the different kinds of results given.
3. Simulation parameters should include a detailed description of the substrate being modelled, e.g., its dimensions, the unit cell used to create the model, etc

Adequacy of Descriptions:
1. Need to ensure that all properties are from simulations, e.g., "processParameters" , "designVariables", and "filmProperties" could come from larger-scale simulations, but do they in this case, or have these properties been extracted from experimental discussions?
2. Results properties need to feature appropriate units, either extracted from the paper or given as "enum"
