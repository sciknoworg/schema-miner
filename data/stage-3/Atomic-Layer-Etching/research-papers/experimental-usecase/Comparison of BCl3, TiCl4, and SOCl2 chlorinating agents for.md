## ABSTRACT

Recent advances in the semiconductor industry have created an exigency for processes that allow to deposit and etch material in conformal matter in three-dimensional devices. While conformal deposition is achieved using atomic layer deposition (ALD), conformal etching can be accomplished by thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) which, like ALD, proceeds via a binary sequence of self-limiting reactions. This study explores ALE of TiO2 and ZrO2 using WF6 as a fluorinating agent, and BCl3, TiCl4, or SOCl2 as a co-reactant. The effect of co-reactant chemistry was studied using atomic force microscopy, in situ ellipsometry, and in vacuo Auger electron spectroscopy measurements along with thermodynamic modeling. All three co-reactants exhibited saturation and etch rates increasing with temperature. At 170 °C, TiO2 can be etched using WF6 with BCl3, TiCl4, or SOCl2, and the etching proceeds at 0.24, 0.18, and 0.20 nm/cycle, respectively. At 325 °C, ZrO2 ALE can occur using these same reactants, proceeding at 0.96, 0.74, and 0.13 nm/cycle, respectively. A higher temperature is needed for ZrO2 ALE versus TiO2 because the ZrCl4 product is less volatile than the corresponding TiCl4. During ZrO2 and TiO2 etching using BCl3 or TiCl4, boron oxide or titanium oxide intermediate layers, respectively, were formed on the surface, and they were subsequently removed by WF6. In contrast, for ALE of TiO2 using SOCl2, a similar intermediate layer is not observed. This study broadens the understanding of co-etchants role during thermal ALE and expands the range of reactants that can be used for vapor etching of metal oxides.

## I. INTRODUCTION

An etching step is an essential procedure in semiconductor manufacturing to remove unwanted materials from the sample substrate. This is done, for example, to etch trenches, shape via holes, or create patterns. While wet etching methods were historically used for microfabrication, continuous device miniaturization has limited their use due to their isotropic nature and hard to control etch rates. 1 As such, dry etching technologies are mainly used in advanced processes due to their more precise feature size control and capability to achieve higher aspect ratios. 1,2 Dry etching technologies include processes that employ physical etching (such as reactive ion etching, sputter etching, or ion milling) or chemical etching [chemical vapor etching (CVE), atomic layer etching].

Vapor etching is conventionally used in the semiconductor industry to etch the sacrificial layer present in a device. For example, xenon difluoride (XeF2) or HF vapor combined with water as a catalyst is employed to remove a silicon oxide layer in silicon MEMS devices. 3 -8 In addition to SiO2, CVE of other materials, such as TiO2, Al2O3, and Cu, have been reported using WF6, HF/Sn(acac)2, and O2/hfach, respectively. 9 11 -However, chemical vapor etching of many materials is limited due to the formation of metal fluorides or other species that are nonvolatile at the reaction temperature. This has enabled the development of atomic layer etching, ALE, which is a self-limiting two-step process. 12 -14 The ALE sequence involves a surface modification step followed by a removal step, where either step can be driven by thermal reactions or by plasma treatment and/or ion bombardment. While the mechanisms for plasma and

ion-based methods have been studied extensively, thermally driven ALE is gaining traction because it can enable isotropic and conformal etching with molecular scale precision, required for complex nanopatterns. 15,16

Thermal ALE processes have been successfully developed for materials including Al2O3, 17 -20 Si, 21,22 SiO2, 23,24 HfO2, 25 -27 ZnO, 28,29 Cu, 30 -32 W, 33,34 TiN, 10,35,36 and others. 37 -46 Mechanisms developed for thermal ALE include fluorination/ligand-exchange, conversion/etch, oxidation/fluorination, and others. 16 ZrO2 has been etched using HF as a fluorinating agent, with Sn(acac)2, AlCl(CH3)2, or SiCl4 as co-reactants to volatilize the fluorinated surface layer through ligand exchange. 10 Similarly, TiO2 ALE has been developed using alternating doses of WF6 and BCl3. 9 In this process, the WF6 fluorinates the surface, creating WOxFy/TiOvFz layer that is volatile at temperatures above 200 °C, enabling CVE of TiO2. At T &lt; 200 °C introducing a BCl3 exposure step allows TiO2 etching to proceed via ALE. At low temperature, BCl3 reacts with the nonvolatile WOxFy/TiOvFz via ligand exchange, producing volatile TiCl4 and WOCl4 products and a thin solid B2O3 layer, which is subsequently etched during the following WF6 exposure step.

In situ analysis techniques allow the monitoring of the etching process under the practical conditions without exposing the sample to atmosphere or interrupting the experiment. In situ ellipsometry can be employed to actively monitor the etch rate or changes in the optical properties of the material being etched. It has been previously utilized to analyze ALE of various materials, including GaN, 46 Ga2O3, 41 ZnO, 29 Cu, 30 and W. 34 To confirm the conversion or removal of an element, in situ chemical analysis methods, such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), can be used. For example, in situ XPS has been used to study the efficiency of acacH versus hfacH for ALE when combined with chlorine gas and to study the mechanism of Fe ALE, when etched using Cl2 and acacH. 37 Similarly, in situ AES has been utilized to study the ALE of GaAs when etched using Cl2 exposure followed by flash heating 47 and to investigate both thermal and plasma enhanced ALE of Al2O3 and HfO2 films. 48

In this article, the etching characteristics of thionyl chloride (SOCl2), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), and boron trichloride (BCl3) are compared when coupled with WF6 in a fluorination/ ligand-exchange atomic layer etching process. The processes are characterized using in situ ellipsometry, in vacuo AES, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicate that while all three chlorinating precursors lead to ALE of ZrO2 and TiO2, the reaction byproducts differ, leading to distinct etch rates and temperature windows. Previously, SOCl2 has been shown to etch TiN. 49 Although WF6/BCl3 are known to enable ALE of TiO2, the drawback of using BCl3 is that the reaction results in a solid B O 2 3 layer, which can be removed by subsequent WF6 exposure. 9 In contrast, we show that exposing TiO2 to SOCl2 results only in volatile species, leaving a clean oxide surface after the SOCl2 step. In addition, we show that at higher temperatures (&gt;190 °C) the exposure of SOCl2 leads to vapor etching of TiO2 by converting the metal oxide to volatile TiCl4 and SO2 species, while ZrO2 is not etched due to the low volatility of ZrCl . These results improve our under4 standing of the importance of co-reactant selection during atomic layer etching processes and expand the range of reactants and materials that can be used for vapor etching of metal oxides.

## II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

## A. Deposition/etch reactor

The etching processes were carried out in a lab-built warmwalled chamber system as shown in Fig. 1. The system consists of a processing chamber, equipped with an in situ multi-wavelength ellipsometer, a load lock and an ultrahigh vacuum analysis chamber, equipped with AES. The samples are introduced into the system on a 2-in. stainless steel puck, which can be transferred between the chambers using linear transfer arms. During processing, the sample was heated to a constant temperature using two PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controlled halogen lamps. Argon (99.999% purity, Arc3 gases) was used as a carrier and purge gas at a flow rate of 95 SCCM, as set by mass-flow controllers. The processing chamber was pumped out using a turbo pump (Seiko-Seiki STP-300C) and a backing pump (Alcatel 2021a) with a throttle valve located before the turbo pump used to control the operating pressure, which was set at 400 mTorr.

## B. Substrate preparation and etching

The TiO2 substrates used in this study were deposited in the same chamber immediately before the etching process using TiCl4 (99% purity, Strem Chemicals) and DI-H2O. Titania was deposited on chemical Si oxide at 170 °C. The zirconia thin films were deposited on alumina thin films using the Ultratech Fiji G2 system. The deposition was carried out at 250 °C using tetrakisdimethylammonia-zirconium (TDMA-Zr) and DI-H2O as precursors. All substrates were purged in argon and held at processing temperature for 30 min to allow the conditions to stabilize before etching. Tungsten hexafluoride (99.99% purity, Galaxy Chemical), boron trichloride (99.9% purity, Matheson), thionyl chloride (99% purity, MilliporeSigma), and titanium tetrachloride (99% purity, Strem Chemicals) were used as etchants. The ALE cycles followed a dosing sequence of WF6/purge/pump/pressurize/ x/purge/pump/pressurize with timings of 0.08/15/10/15/x/15/10/15 s, where x stands for BCl3, TiCl4, or SOCl2 with dosing times of 0.08, 0.1, or 0.2 s, respectively. During the pump step, the throttle valve to a turbo pump is opened completely to evacuate the chamber to a base pressure of 10 -5 Torr. The subsequent pressurization step is

necessary to bring the system back to the stable operating pressure of 400 mTorr. The vapor etching processes followed the same sequence, but without the WF6 dosing step.

## C. Process characterization

The changes in film optical thicknesses during etching processes were monitored using in situ multiwavelength ellipsometer (Film Sense FS-1). The ellipsometer was set at 70° ± 1° incident angle and a data point was obtained after every etching cycle. For greater accuracy, the measurement lasted 10 s and the reported data is an average of the signal collected during that period. The optical film thickness was calculated by fitting the obtained raw ψ and Δ values to a Cauchy model.

In vacuo AES measurements were performed to monitor the elemental composition changes of the metal oxides during etching. The AES system employs a coaxial cylindrical mirror analyzer (Perkin Elmer PHI 10-155) and a 3 kV electron beam. The ultrahigh vacuum analysis chamber was kept at a pressure of ∼ 10 -10 Torr using an ion pump (Digitel 500 220 l/s) and a turbo pump (Edwards EXT501).

The morphology of samples was examined using AFM. The surface roughness data were acquired using Asylum MFP-3D Classic AFM in tapping mode. A silicon probe with a cantilever length of 125 μ m and a force constant of 40 N m -1 was used at ambient conditions.

## III. ETCH SPECIES REACTIONS ON TiO2 AND ZrO2

## A. Thermodynamic modeling of reactant exposure on TiO2 and ZrO2

Thermodynamic analysis 50 was used to predict reactions between gas phase reactants (WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, and TiCl4) and solid TiO2 and ZrO2 in the temperature range of 25 -400 °C. The output gives the resulting equilibrium composition by minimizing the system s free energy. It is important to note that as it is ' a thermodynamic calculation, it does not include kinetic effects and presumes a closed system. The calculations were done at a pressure of 1.5 Torr with the initial molecular ratios of TiO2 to WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, and TiCl4 set at 1:1, 0.75:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1, respectively. Figures 2(a) -2(d) show that when TiO2 reacts with WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, and TiCl4, respectively, the expected primary reactions are

WF6 forms TiF4 vapor and solid WO3 [reaction (1)] whereas at higher temperatures [reaction (2)] the expected products are gaseous TiF4 and WO2F2, consistent with chemical vapor etching. Both BCl3 and SOCl2 [reactions (3) and (4)] are expected to form volatile TiCl , and the BCl 4 3 leaves solid B O3 2 [reaction (3)] whereas SOCl2 forms SO2 vapor [reaction (4)].

## B. Thermodynamic modeling of reactant exposure on ZrO2

Figures 2(e) -2(h) show analogous predicted results for ZrO2 reacting with WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, and TiCl4. The calculations were done with initial molecular ratios of ZrO2 to WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, and TiCl4 set at 1:1, 0.75:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1, respectively. The predicted primary reactions are

When WF6 reacts with ZrO2 at T &lt; 200 °C [reaction (6)], the reaction proceeds similarly as on TiO2, producing solid ZrF4 and solid WO3. Also analogous to the reaction on TiO2, at T &gt; 200 °C, ZrO2 reacting with WF6 is expected to yield gaseous WO2F2 [reaction (7)]. However, unlike the reaction on TiO2, the resulting ZrF4 is expected to remain solid at all temperatures studied. At temperatures above about 200 °C, exposing ZrO2 to BCl3 or SOCl2 [reactions (8) and (10)] produces volatile ZrCl4. For SOCl2 at T &gt; 200 °C, the chlorination of ZrO2 also yields volatile SO2 [reaction (10)]. Therefore, exposing ZrO2 to SOCl2 at T &gt; 200 °C is expected to lead to spontaneous chemical vapor etching. In contrast, exposing ZrO2 to BCl3 [reaction (8)] forms solid B2O3, and this solid layer is expected to inhibit continuous etching of ZrO2. However, at T &gt; 200 °C, as shown below, the B2O3 can be removed in a subsequent WF6 exposure step to achieve ZrO2 atomic layer etching. At lower temperatures, &lt;200 °C, exposing ZrO2 to SOCl2 [reaction (9)] forms a solid Zr(SO3)2/ZrCl4 intermediate layer. On the other hand, at T &lt; 125 °C, reacting ZrO2 with TiCl4 [reaction (11)] is expected to convert ZrO2 into solid TiO2 and produce vapor ZrOCl2. Interestingly, at T &gt; 125 °C, like in the case of TiCl4 +TiO2, the thermodynamic analysis indicates that TiCl4 is not expected to react with ZrO . 2

## C. In situ ellipsometry study of reactions on TiO2

The effect of exposure of individual reactants (WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, TiCl4) on the thickness of the titania and zirconia thin films was analyzed experimentally over a range of reaction temperatures

using in situ ellipsometry. Before etching, the TiO2 film was deposited on a silicon coupon by ALD at 170 °C using TiCl4 and H2O. The deposition was done in the same reactor used for etching, and the films were maintained in the reactor environment between the deposition and etching steps. The resulting change in thickness of the TiO2 for each reactant is plotted in Figs. 3(a) -3(d) as a function of the number of reactant dose steps. The data show that TiO2 is etched by WF6 exposure at temperatures ≥ 200 °C, consistent with the previous results. 9 At temperatures less than 200 °C, the thickness shows a small decrease during initial doses, with no change during subsequent exposures. The data for WF6 exposure on TiO2 are consistent with the thermodynamic analysis described above where spontaneous chemical vapor etching is expected at T&gt;200°C [reaction (2)] but not expected at T &lt; 200 °C due to the formation of solid WO3 [reaction (1)].

For BCl3 and TiCl4 exposures, TiO2 shows no apparent thickness change after the first dose in the temperature range 160 -240 °C. However, exposing TiO2 to SOCl2 at T &gt; 220 °C leads to a thickness decrease. Like WF6, the etch rate using SOCl2 increases as the temperature increases. At T &gt; 200 °C, the experimental results for SOCl 2 reaction on TiO2 are consistent with the thermodynamic analysis showing production of volatile SO2 and TiCl4 [reaction (4)]. Thermodynamically, SOCl2 is also expected to etch TiO 2 at T &lt; 200 °C [reaction (4)] but the experiment shows limited etching, likely due to slow reaction kinetics at low temperatures.

## D. In situ ellipsometry study of reactions on ZrO2

For analysis of ZrO2 etching, ZrO2 films were deposited by ALD at 250 °C using TDMA-Zr and H2O. To avoid possible reactions between the WF6 and the underlying Si after ZrO2 is fully etched, the silicon substrates were pretreated with 50 cycles of ALD Al2O3 before the ZrO2 ALD. 51 For the ZrO2 etching experiments, the deposition was carried out in a separate reactor and the starting ZrO2 sample was transferred in air to the etch reactor. The results of all individual exposures on ZrO2 are plotted in Figs. 3(e) -3(h). Exposing zirconia to WF6 leads to a thickness decrease, but unlike the reaction on TiO2, the thickness decrease stopped after a few initial cycles. The initial decrease of ZrO2 thickness upon WF6 exposure is consistent with the thermodynamic analysis [reaction (7)] showing formation of volatile WO2F2 species and a solid ZrF4 . The solid ZrF4 likely inhibits further reactions with WF . 6

For all temperatures studied, exposing ZrO2 to BCl3, SOCl2, or TiCl4 leads to no significant change in the film thickness [Figs. 3(f) -3(h)]. The results for BCl 3 and TiCl4 are consistent with the thermodynamic analysis [reactions (8) and (11)]. However, at T&gt;200°C, ZrO2 is expected to be etched by SOCl2 [reaction (10)]. The lack of reaction suggests a key step in the reaction mechanism is kinetically limited.

## IV. ATOMIC LAYER ETCHING REACTIONS ON TiO2 AND ZrO2

## A. Thermodynamic modeling of TiO2 ALE process sequence

The results shown above demonstrate that at elevated temperatures, WF6 and SOCl2 will react with TiO2 to produce volatile etch products via chemical vapor etching. At lower temperatures, the formation of solid surface species can be exploited for a more controlled two-step atomic layer etch process. For example, analysis in Fig. 2(a) shows that at T&lt;200°C, exposing TiO2 to WF6 is expected to form solid WO3. Starting from this modified surface, we applied the thermodynamic analysis to explore further reactions that could proceed with the BCl3, SOCl2, and TiCl4 chlorinating reagents, and the results are plotted in Figs. 4(a) -4(c). When BCl3 reacts with solid WO3 [reaction (12)] the expected products are volatile WOCl4 and WO2Cl2 along with solid B2O3. B2O3 can be removed during the subsequent WF6 exposure [reaction (13)] as shown in Fig. S1 in supplementary material, 52 enabling wellcontrolled ALE, where the full ALE cycle includes reaction (1) repeated from above,

$$3 T i O _ { 2 ( s ) } & + 2 W F _ { 6 ( g ) } \to 2 W O _ { 3 ( s ) } \\ & + 3 \ T i F _ { 4 ( g ) } ( 1 4 0 \, ^ { \circ } C < T < 2 0 0 \, ^ { \circ } C ), \quad \quad ( 1 )$$

$$+$$

$$\mathbb { m } _ { \mathbb { C } } ^ { \quad } \quad 2 W O _ { 3 ( s ) } + 2 B C l _ { 3 ( g ) } \to B _ { 2 } O _ { 3 ( s ) } + W O C l _ { 4 ( g ) } + W O _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 ( g ) }, \quad ( 1 2 )$$

$$B _ { 2 } O _ { 3 ( s ) } + W F _ { 6 ( g ) } \rightarrow W O _ { 3 ( s ) } + 2 B F _ { 3 ( g ) }. \quad \quad ( 1 3 )$$

For some applications, the resulting B2O3 intermediate layer may be undesirable. The analysis suggests that exposing WO3 to SOCl2 [reaction (14)] will form volatile SO2 and WO2Cl2 species leaving a clean TiO2 surface. The ALE cycle then follows:

$$\i d e b y \quad & 3 T i O _ { 2 ( s ) } + 2 W F _ { 6 ( g ) } \to 2 W O _ { 3 ( s ) } + 3 T i F _ { 4 ( g ) } ( 1 4 0 ^ { \circ } C < T < 200 0 ^ { \circ } C ), \quad \overset { \infty } { \Xi } \\ \colon \text{real} \quad & ( 1 ) \overset { \infty } { \Xi } \\ \text{fill} \quad & \quad \vdots$$

A similar sequence using WF6 and TiCl4 gives a very different result. Reacting WO3 with TiCl4 is expected to convert WO3 to back to solid TiO2 and vapor WO2Cl2 [reaction (15)]. This reaction sequence does not produce ALE, but instead, the original TiO2 which was converted to WO3 is effectively ' re-converted ' back to ' new ' TiO2 from TiCl4,

$$\text{TiO} _ { 2 ( s ) } + 2 W F _ { 6 ( g ) } \rightarrow 2 W O _ { 3 ( s ) } + 3 T i F _ { 4 ( g ) } ( \text{140} ^ { \circ } C < T < \text{200} ^ { \circ } C ), \quad & \underset { \substack { ( 1 ) \\ \overline { \Sigma } } \\ \text{WO} _ { 3 ( s ) } + \text{SOCI} _ { 2 ( g ) } \rightarrow \text{SO} _ { 2 ( g ) } + \text{WO} _ { 2 } \text{Cl} _ { 2 ( g ) }. \quad & \underset { \substack { ( 1 4 ) \\ \overline { \Sigma } } \\ \overline { \Sigma } } \\ A \text{ similar sequence using WF} _ { 6 } \text{ and } T i \text{Cl} _ { 4 } \text{ gives a very different } \mathfrak { F } \\ \text{ult.

## B. Thermodynamic modeling of ZrO2 ALE process sequence

As shown above, at T&gt;200°C, exposing ZrO2 to WF6 [reaction (7)] is expected to form solid ZrF4. To create an ALE sequence, we used thermodynamic analysis to test possible reactions between ZrF4 and the chlorinating reagents, and the results are plotted in Figs. 4(d) -4(f). Reacting ZrF4 with BCl3 is predicted to result in gaseous BF3 and ZrCl4 products at temperatures above 200 °C [reaction (16)]. Therefore, a possible ALE sequence for ZrO2 uses WF6 and BCl3 at T&gt;200 °C, where reaction (7) is

For the case of ZrF4 reacting with SOCl2 [reaction (17)], the expected products include solid Zr(SO4)2 as well as SF2Cl, ZrCl4, and SO2F2 vapor species. As shown in Fig. S1 in supplementary material, 52 the solid Zr(SO4)2 layer can be removed by subsequent

Note that reactions (17) and (18) are written in unbalanced form, suggesting that the solid layers formed on the surface, indicated as Zr(SO4)2(s) and ZrF4(s), are likely more complex mixtures.

We next consider the possibility for ALE of ZrO2 using WF6 and TiCl4 where the first step follows reaction (7) forming a solid ZrF4 surface layer. For T &lt; ∼ 375 °C, TiCl4 is not reactive with ZrF4, but for T &gt; 375 °C [reaction (19)] TiCl4 undergoes ligand exchange to form volatile ZrCl4 and TiF4. Therefore, ALE can be achieved using TiCl4 as follows:

$$Z r O _ { 2 ( s ) } + W F _ { 6 ( g ) } \to W F _ { 2 } O _ { 2 ( g ) } + Z r F _ { 4 ( s ) } ( T > 200 0 ^ { \circ } C ), \quad ( 7 ) \quad \text{intern}$$

## C. Chemical distinction between TiO2 and ZrO2 ALE

From the thermodynamic analysis above, TiO2 ALE can proceed at low temperature with WF6 and either BCl3 or SOCl2 (but not with TiCl4), and at higher temperatures, ZrO2 ALE can proceed with WF6 and BCl3, SOCl2, or TiCl4. A key difference between these processes is that TiO2 ALE produces a solid oxide intermediate layer, WO3, [reaction (1)], whereas for ZrO2 ALE, the solid intermediate layer is a halide, ZrF4 [reaction (6) or (7)]. For both ALE sequences, this intermediate layer is subsequently removed by reaction with the chloride. For the TiO2 and ZrO2 ALE, the chloride reaction steps proceed very differently. For TiO2 ALE using WF6/BCl3, the solid WO3 intermediate reacts with BCl3, for example, to produce solid B2O3 (i.e., a second intermediate) [reaction (12)], which is then removed by WF6 [reaction (13)]. In contrast, for ZrO2 ALE using WF6/BCl3, the solid ZrF4 intermediate reacts with BCl 3 to produce only gaseous ZrCl4 and BF3 [reaction (16)]. This surface will resemble clean ZrO2, with no second intermediate present.

This distinction is also expected when TiO2 and ZrO2 are exposed to WF6/TiCl4. On TiO2, when the WO3 intermediate reacts with TiCl4 [reaction (15)] the intermediate is ' re-converted ' back to solid TiO2. The overall reaction [i.e., reaction (1) + reaction (15)] shows a net loss of TiO2, consistent with ALE as shown in Fig. 5(a). Therefore, analogous with TiO2 ALE with WF6/BCl3, the re-converted solid TiO2 layer is the ' second intermediate, ' which is removed by the following WF6 dose. On ZrO2, also analogous with ZrO2 ALE with WF6/BCl3, reacting the ZrF4 intermediate with TiCl4

at T&gt;375°C [reaction (19)] yields volatile TiF4 and ZrCl4, with no second intermediate formed.

Interestingly, for etching using WF6/SOCl2, the distinction between TiO2 and ZrO2 reverses. On TiO2, the solid WO3 intermediate reacts with SOCl2 to form only volatile species [reaction (14)] leaving a clean TiO2 surface, whereas during ZrO2 etching, the intermediate solid ZrF4 reacts with SOCl2 [reaction (17)] to form both solid Zr(SO4)2(s) (i.e., the second intermediate) and volatile ZrCl4(g). The solid Zr(SO4)2 is then converted back to ZrF4(s) by reacting with WF6 [reaction (18)]. Therefore, similar to TiO2 ALE by WF6/TiCl4, when WF6/SOCl2 is used for ZrO2 ALE, the ZrF4(s) is partially removed as SO2F2(g) and partially converted to Zr(SO4)2 (s) so that the net amount of Zr removed per ALE cycle is expected to be less than one stoichiometric ZrO2 layer. This is consistent with the results in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d) showing a relatively small etch thickness per cycle for ZrO2 ALE using WF6/SOCl2 compared to ALE using WF6 with BCl3 or TiCl4.

## D. In situ ellipsometry analysis of TiO2 and ZrO2 ALE

In situ ellipsometry was used to obtain the saturation curves for etching of both TiO2 and ZrO2. For this experiment, the dose time for each chlorinating agent was adjusted, keeping the dose time of the WF6 dose fixed at 0.14 s, and the etch per cycle (EPC) was measured and plotted as a function of dose time. Similarly, for the WF6 saturation, the dose times of BCl3/TiCl4/SOCl2 were fixed at 0.14/0.25/0.25 s, while the dose time of WF6 was varied in independent runs. The results are plotted in Fig. 5, where the EPC is presented as an average etch rate over 10 ALE cycles carried out at 170 °C for TiO2 and at 325 °C for ZrO2. The ellipsometry data used to determine the EPC for each material are shown in Fig. S2 in supplementary material. 52 It is evident that each of the chemistries showed reasonable reaction saturation, consistent with self-limiting atomic layer etching. The etch rates of TiO2 saturated at 0.24, 0.18, and 0.20 nm/cycle for BCl3, TiCl4, and SOCl2, respectively. The saturated etch rates of ZrO2 are 0.96, 0.74, and 0.13 nm/cycle, respectively. The EPC saturates at 0.08 s dosing times for WF6 for all processes, while 0.08 s is required for BCl , and 0.2 s for both TiCl 3 4 and SOCl2 to reach saturation on both TiO2 and ZrO2.

Using in situ ellipsometry, the etched thickness per cycle was also measured over a range of reaction temperatures, where the dose times were fixed at the values obtained for saturation at 170 and 325 °C for TiO2 and ZrO2, respectively. Etch rates obtained at T=160 190 °C for TiO2 -and 250 -325 °C for ZrO2 are plotted in Fig. 6. The etch rate is strongly dependent on the temperature and increases linearly with temperature for all reactions studied. The etch rate of ZrO2 using WF6/SOCl2 remains close to zero for temperatures ≤ 300 °C, rising to ∼ 0.16 nm/cycle at 325 °C. We note that the thermodynamic analysis results in Fig. 4(e) and Fig. S1(b) in supplementary material 52 indicate ZrO2 etching by WF6/SOCl2 is expected to proceed at 300 °C. The slow rate suggests some kinetic limitation, possibly corresponding to the fluorination of the surface Zr(SO4)2.

## E. Elemental characterization of TiO2 and ZrO2 ALE

The atomic layer etching trends were further analyzed by in situ ellipsometry and in vacuo Auger electron spectroscopy. The resulting chemical compositions and optical thicknesses are plotted in Fig. 7 for titania and Fig. 8 for zirconia, while the raw AES spectra are shown in Fig. S3 in supplementary material. 52 For these experiments, TiO2 was first deposited using 40 ALD cycles on chemical silicon oxide at 170 °C, resulting in an ∼ 2 nm amorphous titania film. The etching was performed in the same reactor, also at 170 °C, using WF6 with BCl3, SOCl2, or TiCl4 under saturated dose conditions (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 7, the TiO2 thickness measured by ellipsometry decreases at a nearly constant EPC starting from the first ALE cycle, with some reduction in rate as the film thickness approaches zero. After 10 ALE cycles under the conditions used, ellipsometry measurements show &lt;0.1 nm of TiO2 remaining for all etchants studied.

The ellipsometry results were complemented by AES measurements. The AES was performed on different samples prepared under conditions identical to those for the ellipsometry study.

For these runs, AES was performed on the as-deposited TiO2, and on newly prepared samples after 5 and 25 ALE cycles. In every case, the at. % of Ti decreases and the at. % of Si increases, with no Ti being detected after 25 ALE cycles, confirming that the ALE removes all of the TiO2 film. After five WF6/BCl3 ALE cycles, 7 at. % of boron was detected, consistent with some boron oxide, as shown in Eq. (12). For the WF6/SOCl2 process, the surface showed 8 at. % of tungsten, consistent with the formation of tungsten oxide in Eq. (1). After 25 cycles, the AES shows no signals from these elements, indicating a clean etch surface.

should be volatilized as BF3(g). The presence of residual boron, therefore, suggests that the rate of BF3(g) formation may be relatively slow. Another possibility is that BCl3 reacts with small amounts of WO3 in the film to form solid B2O3 [Eq. (12)]. This is also consistent with the minute W signal detected on the surface after ALE. After 25 cycles of WF6/BCl3, ellipsometry indicates the ZrO2 film is completely removed, while the AES shows a small signal corresponding to ∼ 2 at. % of Zr remaining on the surface.

Similar experiments were also performed for ZrO2 etching. For these tests, approximately 3.5 nm thick zirconia films were deposited on silicon pretreated with ALD Al2O3, and samples were loaded into the ALE reactor connected with the AES. The results of in situ ellipsometry and AES analysis are shown in Fig. 8. Using WF6/BCl3 or WF6/TiCl4, the ellipsometry shows that the etched thickness per cycle was constant starting from the first ALE cycle. Using WF6/SOCl2, the etch per cycle is also constant, with some enhanced etching observed during the first ALE cycle.

The AES results in Figs. 8(b) -8(d) confirm the etching of ZrO2 at 325 °C by all processes tried as evidenced by the decreasing concentration of Zr and appearance of Al from the underlying Al2O3. Using BCl3 as a co-etchant resulted in residue boron of 12 and 3 at. % after 5 and 25 ALE cycles, respectively. At this temperature, the thermodynamic analysis [Eq. (16)] indicates that boron

Using TiCl4 with WF6 for ALE of ZrO2 at 325 °C resulted in 1 at. % of Ti present after five ALE cycles. At 325 °C, the formation of TiF4(g) may not be as fast as expected at higher temperatures [Eq. (19)]. After 25 cycles, no Ti was detected, but similar to that for BCl3, some Zr (3 at. %) remained present. Using SOCl2 with WF6, due to its smaller etch per cycle, 15 at. % of Zr was detected on the surface after 25 ALE cycles. Moreover, 2 at. % of S was measured after both 5 and 25 cycles [Eq. (17)]. In the WF6/SOCl2 process, the change in ZrO2 etch rate after the first ALE cycle can be attributed to a relatively slower reaction rate for WF 6 with solid Zr(SO4)2(s) [reaction (18)] compared with the rate of reaction with the initial ZrO2 surface [reaction (7)]. This is also confirmed by the S detected by AES after SOCl2 exposure. While the ellipsometry indicated complete removal of the ZrO2 film, in conflict with the Zr at. % measured by the AES, it is important to note that the underlying Al2O3 surface increases the complexity of the ellipsometric modeling and leads to a larger possible error.

after 5 and 25 ALE cycles is plotted in Fig. 9, while the surface images are shown in Fig. S4 in supplementary material. 52 All the samples showed smooth surfaces with RMS surface roughness below 0.2 nm. Both titania and zirconia indicated surface smoothing by ALE processes. The measured roughness of TiO2 decreased slightly with etching. Likewise, the RMS roughness of ZrO2 dropped from ∼ 200 to ∼ 80 pm after 5 ALE cycles and remained constant after 25 cycles, indicating uniform etching and no residue in the shape of nuclei on the resulting surface for all processes studied.

## V. CONCLUSIONS

This work describes the impact of co-reactant structure during thermal atomic layer etching of TiO2 and ZrO2 thin films. BCl3, TiCl4, and SOCl2 were studied as co-etchants in a fluorination and ligand-exchange process when coupled with WF6. In addition to ALE, it was shown that at temperatures above 200 °C, both WF6 and SOCl2 led to chemical vapor etching of TiO2, while none of the reactants individually etched ZrO2 due to the formation of a solid layer inhibiting further reaction.

The ALE behavior was shown to be strongly dependent on the co-etchant, temperature, and substrate material. Using in situ ellipsometry, the etch rate was shown to increase linearly with the temperature for all chemistries, except for ZrO2 etching using WF6/SOCl2, which was limited by the unsuccessful removal of Zr

(SO4)2 by WF6 exposure at temperatures ≤ 300 °C. The etch rates of TiO2 at 170 °C were measured as 0.24, 0.18, and 0.20 nm/cycles for WF6 and BCl3, TiCl4, or SOCl2, respectively. The respective etch rates of ZrO2 were 0.96, 0.74, and 0.13 nm/cycle at 325 °C. A higher temperature for ZrO2 was needed due to a lower volatility of the formed ZrCl4 compared to TiCl4. All of the etchants studied showed saturating EPC as a function of etchant dosing times, characteristic of ALE processes.

The chemical reactions and the resulting compositions were analyzed by thermodynamic modeling and in vacuo AES. During TiO2 ALE, the SOCl2 exposure leads to volatile SO2 and TiCl4, in contrast to BCl3 and TiCl4, which result in solid B2O3 and TiO2 on the surface, subsequently removed by WF6 exposure. In contrast to TiO2, all co-etchants led to the formation of solid species on ZrO2 after exposure. BCl3 resulted in B2O3, TiCl4 in TiO2, and SOCl2 in Zr(SO4)2 at 325 °C. While the resulting layers are removed by subsequent WF6 exposure, they could be undesirable reaction products when complete removal of the film is not desired. As such, co-reactant selection strongly affects the purity of the final sample depending on the metal oxide being etched. The results illustrate the importance of the co-reactant design during thermal atomic layer etching processes depending on the target material to be etched, desired processing temperature range, and the substrate.
