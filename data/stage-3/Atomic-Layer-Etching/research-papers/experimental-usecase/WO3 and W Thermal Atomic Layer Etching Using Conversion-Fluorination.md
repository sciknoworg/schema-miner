ABSTRACT: The thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of WO3 and W was demonstrated with new ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidationconversion/uniFB02 uorination ' etching mechanisms. Both of these mechanisms are based on sequential, self-limiting reactions. WO 3 ALE was achieved by a ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism using an AB exposure sequence with boron trichloride (BCl ) and hydrogen 3 /uniFB02 uoride (HF). BCl3 converts the WO3 surface to a B O 2 3 layer while forming volatile WO Cl x y products. Subsequently, HF spontaneously etches the B O3 2 layer producing volatile BF3 and H2O products. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) studies determined that the BCl3 and HF reactions were self-limiting versus exposure. The WO3 ALE etch rates increased with temperature from 0.55 Å/cycle at 128 ° C to 4.19 Å/cycle at 207 ° C. W served as an etch stop because BCl3 and HF could not etch the underlying W /uniFB01 lm. W ALE was

performed using a three-step ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism. In this ABC exposure sequence, the W surface is /uniFB01 rst oxidized to a WO 3 layer using O /O3. Subsequently, the WO3 2 layer is etched with BCl 3 and HF. SE could simultaneously monitor the W and WO3 thicknesses and conversion of W to WO3. SE measurements showed that the W /uniFB01 lm thickness decreased linearly with number of ABC reaction cycles. W ALE was shown to be self-limiting with respect to each reaction in the ABC process. The etch rate for W ALE was ∼ 2.5 Å/cycle at 207 ° C. An oxide thickness of ∼ 20 Å remained after W ALE, but could be removed by sequential BCl3 and HF exposures without a /uniFB00 ecting the W layer. These new etching mechanisms will enable the thermal ALE of a variety of additional metal materials including those that have volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The continued miniaturization of advanced semiconductor devices requires atomic layer control in both growth and etching processes. 1 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atomic layer etching (ALE) techniques can provide the necessary atomic level precision. 2 ALD techniques have been developed for a wide range of materials over the past few decades and have been extensively adapted by the semiconductor industry. 3,4 In contrast, the need for ALE techniques has emerged more recently, and ALE methods are still in an early stage of development. 5

Initial plasma ALE methods have been based on surface activation by halogenation followed by ion bombardment to remove surface material. 5 Plasma processes have been developed for a variety of materials including Si, 6,7 compound semiconductors, 8,9 metal oxides, 10 -12 and carbon materials. 13,14 The plasma ALE method can achieve anisotropic etching. Thermal ALE techniques have also been demonstrated with /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. 15 Thermal ALE methods have been developed for Al2O3, 16 -19 HfO2, 20 ZrO2, 21 AlN, 22 and AlF3. 23 Thermal ALE is able to provide isotropic etching.

Materials with volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides do not have thermal ALE pathways using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions

because their /uniFB02 uorides are gases. Other materials, such as elemental metals, may /uniFB02 uorinate readily and produce /uniFB02 uoride layers too thick for ALE. For these materials, alternative pathways are required for controlled atomic layer etching. Some new strategies in thermal ALE have recently been introduced based on ' conversion-etch ' mechanisms. 24,25 In the conversion-etch procedure, the surface layer is converted to a di /uniFB00 erent material that can be /uniFB02 uorinated and removed by ligand-exchange. Conversion-etch approaches also have the potential to provide pathways for the ALE of materials with volatile /uniFB02 uorides.

In this Article, ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidationconversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanisms are demonstrated for thermal ALE. The conversion reactions utilize BCl3 as the reactant. BCl 3 has the ability to convert many metal oxides to B2O3. B2O3 has a volatile /uniFB02 uoride and can be easily removed spontaneously as BF 3 and H2O by HF exposures. The example of ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' is WO3 ALE using BCl3 and HF as the reactants in an AB sequence. The example of ' oxidation-

conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' is WALE using O2/O3, BCl3, and HF in an ABC sequence.

Figure 1 shows the various reaction steps for W and WO3 ALE. In reaction A, W is oxidized to WO3 using ozone (O2/

O3). In reaction B, BCl 3 is used to convert the surface of WO 3 to a B2O3 surface layer. During this conversion, the chlorine ligands are transferred from BCl 3 to the surface to form volatile WO Cl x y products. In reaction C, the B2O3 surface layer can then be etched spontaneously by HF to form H2O and BF3 products. The conversion of WO3 to B O3 2 is necessary because HF cannot spontaneously etch WO3.

Reactions A, B, and C in Figure 1 based on oxidation, conversion, and /uniFB02 uorination are all thermochemically favorable. 26 The reaction and standard free energy changes for the oxidation of W to WO3 using O3 or O2 are

$$W + 3 O _ { 3 } ( g ) \to W O _ { 3 } + 3 O _ { 2 } ( g ) & & \quad \ f a b r i \\ \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 \, ^ { \circ } C ) = - 2 9 6. 7 \, k c a l / \text{mol} & & ( 1 ) & & \quad \text{seni} \\ \text{NEM}$$

Proposed conversion reactions of WO3 with BCl3 to yield various possible WO Cl x y reaction products and their standard free energy changes are

$$& \text{WO} _ { 3 } + 2 \text{BCI} _ { 3 } ( g ) \to B _ { 2 } \text{O} _ { 3 } + \text{WCl} _ { 6 } ( g ) \\ & \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 \, ^ { \circ } C ) = - 7. 7 \, \text{kcal/mol}$$

$$W O _ { 3 } + 2 \mathcal { U } _ { 3 } ( g ) \to \mathfrak { B } _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + \mathcal { W } \mathcal { I } _ { 6 } ( g ) & & \text{layer} \\ \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } C ) & = - 7. 7 \, k c a l / \text{mol} & & ( 3 ) & \text{entha} \\ W O _ { 3 } + 4 / 3 \mathcal { B } \mathcal { I } _ { 3 } ( g ) \to 2 / 3 \mathcal { B } _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + \mathcal { W } \mathcal { O } \mathcal { I } _ { 4 } ( g ) & & \text{films} \\ \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } C ) & = - 4. 3 \, k c a l / \text{mol} & & ( 4 ) & \text{sequ} \\ W O _ { 3 } + 2 / 3 \mathcal { B } \mathcal { I } _ { 3 } ( g ) \to 1 / 3 \mathcal { B } _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + \mathcal { W } \mathcal { O } _ { 2 } \mathcal { I } _ { 2 } ( g ) & & \text{flow} \\ \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } C ) & = - 7. 8 \, k c a l / \text{mol} & & ( 5 ) & \text{spect} \\ \text{In addition, the reaction for the fluorination of } B, O _ { 3 } \text{ to volatile} & & \text{dime}$$

In addition, the reaction for the /uniFB02 uorination of B O 2 3 to volatile BF3 and H2O reaction products and the standard free energy change is

$$F \quad & B _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + 6 H F ( g ) \to 2 B F _ { 3 } ( g ) + 3 H _ { 2 } O ( g ) \\ \rangle _ { 3 } & \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } C ) = - 1 7. 3 \, k c a l / \text{mol}$$

After removal of the B2O3 surface layer, a new W or WO3 surface remains. The reactions can then be repeated to etch either W or WO3. W ALE uses reactions A, B, and C. WO3 ALE uses reactions B and C.

HF alone should not etch or react with the WO3 or W surface. Likewise, BCl3 should not react with the W surface. The expectations for these reactions are based on their positive standard free energy changes:

$$\begin{array} { l l } & W O _ { 3 } + 6 H F ( g ) \to W F _ { 6 } + 3 H _ { 2 } O ( g ) \\ & \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 0 0 \, ^ { \circ } C ) = + 3 2. 6 \, k c a l / \text{mol} \end{array}$$

W and WO3 can also be etched spontaneously using various dry etching techniques. Methods for spontaneous tungsten etching utilize plasmas containing various halogens such as /uniFB02 uorine 27 -29 or chlorine. 28,30,31 Tungsten etching occurs through formation of volatile chlorides or /uniFB02 uorides. Tungsten can also be etched by Cl2 or XeF2 gases. 30,32,33 WO3 can be etched spontaneously with halogen-containing plasmas using NF3 or SF6. 34 -36 WF6 is also known to etch WO3 spontaneously at &gt;180 ° C from WO3 ALD studies using WF6 and H2O as the reactants. 37,38 This spontaneous etching of WO3 by WF6 suggests a pathway for W ALE based on sequential reactions with W oxidation followed by WF6 exposures to remove WO3.

W ALE and WO3 ALE may have applications in a variety of areas. In the semiconductor industry, W is employed as a conductor in contact holes and vias. 39 W is also utilized for fabricating gates in 3D NAND memory devices. 40 Outside the semiconductor industry, W has application in MEMS and NEMS structures. 41,42 WO3 also is a useful material for water splitting 43 and gas sensing. 44 The atomic layer controlled etching of W and WO3 may be needed for device fabrication. The isotropic etching of W may be particularly useful for the lateral etching required to fabricate W gates in 3D NAND /uniFB02 ash memory. 40

## 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

W samples were deposited on Si wafers with a 500 nm thermal oxide layer. The SiO2 layer improves the sensitivity of the in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis by providing interference enhancement. 45 Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were /uniFB01 rst grown on the SiO 2 thermal oxide layer at 130 ° C using 15 Al2 O3 ALD cycles. These Al2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms provided an adhesion layer for W ALD growth. 46 W ALD /uniFB01 lms with a thickness of 250 Å were then deposited at 130 ° C with sequential self-limiting reactions of WF6 and Si H6. 2 47 These Al2 O3 ALD and W ALD /uniFB01 lms were deposited in a separate hot-wall viscous /uniFB02 ow reactor. Upon exposure to atmosphere, an oxide thickness of 12 -30 Å is formed on the W /uniFB01 lm as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity (XRR) analysis. 48,49

The Si wafer was then diced to produce W coupons with dimensions of 1.6 × 1.6 cm. These W coupons were placed in a reaction chamber that has been described previously. 50 This reaction chamber is similar to other plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD)

reactors equipped for in situ SE measurements. 51 The chamber walls were coated with ∼ 500 cycles of Al O 2 3 ALD using Al(CH3)3 and H2O as the reactants at the chamber wall temperature of 170 ° C. WO3 /uniFB01 lms were prepared by the oxidation of the W ALD /uniFB01 lms at 280 ° C using an O2 plasma at 600 W with an O2 pressure of 100 mTorr. The O2 plasma exposures produced a WO3 /uniFB01 lm thickness of 130 -150 Å on the W ALD /uniFB01 lms.

A remote inductively coupled plasma (ICP) provided oxygen radicals for the oxidation of W to WO3. A quartz tube (6 cm inner diameter × 25 cm long) encircled by a helical copper coil was the ICP source. A 13.56 MHz RF generator (Paramount RF Power Supply, Advanced Energy) and 50 Ω impedance matching network (Navigator Digital Matching Network, Advanced Energy) were used in conjunction to generate the ICP plasma. The distance between the ICP source and the W coupon was ∼ 4 cm.

Etching of the WO3 and W /uniFB01 lms was monitored by in situ SE using a J.A. Woollam M-2000D ellipsometer. This ellipsometer has a spectral range of 240 -1700 nm and utilized an incidence angle of 70 . The ° WO3 and W /uniFB01 lms were analyzed to obtain /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after each reaction cycle or each individual reaction. A schematic showing the /uniFB01 lm stack and ellipsometer optical beams is shown in Figure 2. Note

that the individual layer thicknesses are not to scale. SE has the ability to measure the thicknesses of each individual layer in the /uniFB01 lm stack. This allows for simultaneous determination of the WO3 and W /uniFB01 lm thicknesses.

The WO3 /uniFB01 lms were analyzed using the Complete Ease software package from J.A. Woollam. The model employed a Tauc -Lorentz oscillator and a Gaussian oscillator. 52 Only the parameters of the Tauc -Lorentz oscillator model were varied from the starting parameters to increase the accuracy of the model. The metal W layer underneath the WO3 layer was measured by a B-Spline model. 53 n and k values for bulk W were used as the initial parameters and were varied to /uniFB01 t the experimental data.

Boron trichloride (99.9%, Synquest Laboratories) and HF-pyridine (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the reactants. The reactants were separately dosed into the reaction chamber together with a constant stream of ultrahigh purity (UHP) nitrogen. The reactants were introduced using two pneumatic valves (Swagelok-HBVVCR4-C for BCl3 or Swagelok-6LVV-DPFR4-P-C for HF) on either side of a conductance limiting valve (Swagelok SS-4BMG-VCR). The pneumatic valves were actuated using LabView.

Between each reactant exposure, the reaction chamber was purged with UHP nitrogen gas for 130 s at a pressure of 1180 mTorr. The O 3 for the oxidation reaction during W ALE was produced by an O3ONIA ozone generator with oxygen [Airgas, 99.999%]. The gas /uniFB02 ow from the ozone generator contained ∼ 10% of O3 in O2. The O2 pressure used for the oxidation reaction was 70 mTorr. Therefore, the O3 pressure was ∼ 7 mTorr. The HF and BCl3 purge times were 130 s during W ALE using the O2/O3 exposures. The purge time after the O2/O3 exposures was 60 s.

Samples were heated on a sample stage inside of the reaction chamber. A constant temperature of 207 ° C was used for all of the ALE experiments performed to determine the self-limiting conditions. The temperature was initially targeted to be 200 ° C. A temperature calibration revealed that the temperature was 207 ° C. The temperature of the sample stage was varied during the studies of WO 3 ALE etch rate versus temperature. The chamber walls were held constant at 170 ° C. A rotary vane pump (Alcatel 2010) was used to pump the chamber to a base pressure of ∼ 20 mTorr. A capacitance monometer measured the chamber base pressure and pressure transients from each reactant.

measured using in situ SE during the etching of the WO 3 layer on the W /uniFB01 lm. These results were obtained using an AB exposure sequence with BCl3 and HF as the reactants. Figure 3 displays results for 40 reaction cycles at a substrate temperature at 207 ° C. The initial WO3 /uniFB01 lm thickness is ∼ 150 Å. The WO3 /uniFB01 lm thickness decreases linearly until reaching a WO3 /uniFB01 lm thickness of ∼ 10 Å. The etching of the WO3 layer is linear over this range of thicknesses with an etch rate of 4.18 Å/cycle. The SE measurements con /uniFB01 rmed that there was no change in the underlying W /uniFB01 lm thickness during WO3 etching.

The WO3 etch rate is reduced dramatically when the WO3 layer reaches a thickness of ∼ 10 Å. At this point, the WO /W 3 interface is nearby and the WO 3 layer may undergo a transition to WO x oxides where x &lt; 3 before reaching the underlying W /uniFB01 lm. These WO x oxides may not be amenable to the ' conversion-etch ' procedure using BCl3 and HF. As a result, the etch rate slows when the tungsten oxide layer thickness reaches a thickness of ∼ 5 Å. The underlying W /uniFB01 lm acts as an etch stop because the W /uniFB01 lm is not etched by the sequential exposures of BCl3 and HF.

Figure 4 shows the WO3 thickness versus number of BCl3 and HF cycles at 207 ° C for 20 cycles. The BCl3 exposures were 325 mTorr s. The maximum BCl3 pressure during these exposures was ∼ 40 mTorr. The HF exposures were 200 mTorr

s. The maximum HF pressure during these exposures was ∼ 60 mTorr. Each dose was followed by an UHP N2 purge lasting 130 s. The data points in Figure 4 show the individual SE measurements of the WO3 thickness after each reaction cycle. The etching of WO3 is linear with an R 2 value of 0.999. The WO3 etch rate is 4.18 Å/cycle. Multiple measurements of WO3 ALE at 207 ° C yielded etch rates that varied from 3.98 -4.44 Å/ cycle. Crystalline WO3 has a monoclinic structure with cell dimensions of a = 7.306 Å, b = 7.540 Å, and c = 7.692 Å. 54 The WO3 etch rate is slightly more than one-half of the WO 3 unit cell lengths.

The etching of WO3 by BCl3 and HF occurs by the ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism where BCl3 converts the WO3 surface layer to a B2O3 layer. During the conversion of WO3 to B2O3, the likely reaction product is a volatile WO Cl x y compound. HF can then spontaneously remove the B2O3 layer by forming BF3 and H2O as reaction products. The removal of B2O3 regenerates the original WO 3 surface and completes one BCl3/HF reaction cycle. The conversion of WO3 to B2O3 is driven by the higher stability of B O 2 3 as compared to WO3. 26 The etching of B O3 2 by HF occurs because both BF3 and H2O are volatile reaction products.

To prove that B2O3 can be spontaneously etched by HF, B2O3 /uniFB01 lms were grown with BCl3 and H2O at 20 ° C. This method was adapted from the previously reported B2O3 ALD process with BBr 3 and H2O as the reactants at 20 ° C. 55 B2O3 /uniFB01 lms were grown using 600 cycles of BCl 3 and H2O at 20 ° C. This B2O3 ALD process led to B2O3 /uniFB01 lms with a thickness of ∼ 580 Å. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of these /uniFB01 lms was consistent with stoichiometric B O 2 3 /uniFB01 lms. The B2O3 /uniFB01 lms were then heated to 207 ° C for the HF exposures.

The B2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were exposed to HF pressures of 100 mTorr for 1 s. SE measurements were performed 60 s after the initial HF exposure. The SE measurements were then repeated 12 min after the /uniFB01 rst measurements to verify that no further etching occurred without additional HF exposures. Figure 5 shows the B2O3 /uniFB01 lm thickness versus the number of HF exposures for six HF exposures. Each HF exposure removes ∼ 2 Å of the B2O3 /uniFB01 lm. The second scan recorded after 12 min con /uniFB01 rms that no additional etching is observed in the absence

Figure 5. B2O3 thickness versus number of HF exposures showing spontaneous etching of B2O3 /uniFB01 lm at 207 ° C. HF exposure was 100 mTorr s, and B2O3 etch rate is ∼ 2 Å per HF exposure.

of HF exposures. These experiments demonstrate that HF can spontaneously etch the B2O3 /uniFB01 lm. The B2O3 etching is dependent on the HF pressure and the HF exposure time. The spontaneous B2O3 etching will continue for at least 20 -30 HF exposures.

Both BCl3 and HF exposures are required for WO3 etching. Without HF exposures, BCl3 exposures alone cannot etch WO3. Without BCl3 exposures, HF exposures alone did not etch WO3. Figure 6 examines the self-limiting BCl3 and HF reactions during WO3 ALE at 207 ° C. The etch rates were determined by varying one reactant while holding the other reactant at a constant reactant exposure. Each precursor was dosed into a stream of UHP N2 gas at a pressure of 1180 mTorr. The purge time after each reactant exposure was 130 s.

The self-limiting behavior for the WO 3 etch rate versus the BCl3 exposure is shown in Figure 6a. The BCl 3 exposures were varied from 0 to 492 mTorr s. The HF exposures were held constant at 200 mTorr s. Increasing the BCl 3 exposure to &gt;225 mTorr s did not produce signi /uniFB01 cantly more WO3 etching. The BCl3 reaction with WO3 is self-limiting at the larger BCl3 exposures with an etch rate of ∼ 4.2 Å/cycle.

The self-limiting behavior of the HF exposure is shown in Figure 6b. The HF exposure was varied from 0 to 318 mTorr s. BCl3 exposures were held constant at 327 mTorr s. The WO3 etch rate increases progressively versus HF exposure. Increasing the HF exposure to &gt;200 mTorr s did not produce signi /uniFB01 cantly more WO3 etching. The HF reaction with WO3 is self-limiting at larger HF exposures with an etch rate of ∼ 4.2 Å/cycle.

Figure 7 shows SE measurements that were recorded after each BCl3 and HF exposure during WO3 ALE at 207 ° C for 26 half-cycles. The WO3 thickness decreases linearly with the number of half-cycles. An expansion of the WO3 thickness versus number of half-cycles for four half-cycles is displayed in Figure 8. The SE model assumed that the entire /uniFB01 lm was WO3. Adding a Cauchy layer to account for the B2O3 layer on the WO3 /uniFB01 lm after the BCl 3 conversion reaction did not improve the SE /uniFB01 tting. Figure 8 indicates that the WO 3 thickness etched in one BCl3/HF cycle is 4.29 Å. The thickness loss after the BCl3 exposure is 2.99 Å. The thickness loss after the HF exposure is 1.30 Å.

The WO3 thickness loss of 4.29 Å during one complete cycle represents 1.32 × 10 -9 WO3 mol/cm 2 based on a WO3 density of 7.16 g/cm 3 and a WO3 molar mass of 231.8 g/mol. During the WO3 etching, WO3 can be converted to various amounts of B2O3 depending on the possible BCl3 conversion reactions given by eqs 3 -5. The thickness loss of 2.99 Å after the BCl 3 exposure leaves a B O 2 3 thickness of 1.30 Å on the surface. The SE modeling assumes that the B2O3 thickness can be modeled as indistinguishable from a WO 3 thickness. This B O 2 3 thickness is then removed by the subsequent HF exposure.

The B2O3 thickness of 1.30 Å on the surface prior to removal by HF is in agreement with the BCl 3 conversion reaction given by eq 5. This BCl3 conversion reaction yields WO2Cl2 as the volatile reaction product. On the basis of eq 5, the predicted B2O3 thickness remaining on the surface after the conversion of 4.29 Å of WO3 or 1.32 × 10 -9 WO3 mol/cm 2 is 1.25 Å. The predicted B2O3 thickness of 1.25 Å agrees well with the measured B2O3 thickness of 1.30 Å. Mass spectrometry studies are needed to con /uniFB01 rm WO2Cl2 as the volatile reaction product.

The WO3 /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus number of BCl3 and HF reaction cycles at di /uniFB00 erent substrate temperatures are shown in Figure 9. The self-limiting reaction conditions at 207 ° C were used for all of the various temperatures. The self-limiting conditions were a BCl3 exposure of 325 mTorr s and an HF exposure of 200 mTorr s. All of the initial WO3 thicknesses were referenced to a starting value of 140 Å to compare the results at 128, 160, 196, and 207 ° C. For all of the temperatures, the WO3 etching is linear with the number of reaction cycles. The etch rate also increases at higher temperatures. The etch rates are 0.55, 2.04, 2.95, and 4.19 Å/ cycle at 128, 160, 196, and 207 ° C, respectively.

Figure 10 shows an Arrhenius plot of all of the etch rates at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures acquired from the SE measurements. The approximately linear plot of ln(etch rate) versus 1/ T shows that the etch rates are nearly exponentially dependent on temperature. The temperature-dependent WO3 etch rate exhibits an activation energy of 8.6 kcal/mol. The temperature dependence of the WO3 etch rate provides a means to control the WO3 etch rate.

opens a pathway to W ALE. Tungsten can /uniFB01 rst be oxidized to WO3. Subsequently, WO3 can be etched using sequential BCl 3 and HF exposures as described in section 3.1. The oxidation of Wto produce WO3 must be self-limiting to obtain atomic layer control of W etching. This requirement is demanding because oxidation of metals is generally very favorable, and often the oxidation can extend deep into the initial metal.

Tungsten oxidation has been studied extensively over a variety of temperatures and oxidation conditions. Many investigations have been reported at high temperatures &gt;500 ° C where tungsten oxidizes readily to form WO3 and other tungsten oxides. 56,57 At temperatures &gt;800 ° C, these oxides can also desorb into the gas phase. 58 At temperatures between 300 and 400 ° C, tungsten is oxidized by O 2 to form a WO3 layer with thicknesses of 10 -50 nm. 59 -61 The WO3 layer acts as a di /uniFB00 usion barrier that limits further oxidation. 62

At lower temperatures of &lt;300 ° C, the tungsten oxidation is limited to thin WO3 /uniFB01 lms on the W substrate. 59,61,63 Oxide thicknesses of 10 -16 Å have been reported after O 2 exposures on polycrystalline W substrates for 1 h at 23 -200 ° C. 61 Somewhat thicker oxide thicknesses have been measured when using O2 5 plasmas to oxidize tungsten at lower temperatures. 64,6 Tungsten oxidation at these lower temperatures is compatible with the temperature for WO3 ALE and also is selflimiting at thin /uniFB01 lm thicknesses that are required for an ALE process.

these experiments, the surface of the W /uniFB01 lm was oxidized to WO3 using O2/O3 pressures of 70 mTorr. The WO3 layer was then etched using the next BCl3 and HF exposures. The W ALE was conducted under self-limiting conditions for the O / 2 O3, BCl3, and HF reactions at 207 ° C as discussed below. The O2/O3 exposure was 3150 mTorr s, the BCl3 exposure was 329 mTorr s, and the HF exposure was 2800 mTorr s.

Figure 11 reveals that the tungsten /uniFB01 lm thickness decreases linearly versus the number of cycles. The etch rate is 2.56 Å/ cycle, and the R 2 value of the linear /uniFB01 t is 0.996. Multiple SE measurements of W ALE at 207 ° C yielded etch rates that varied from 2.35 -2.56 Å/cycle. XRR measurements con /uniFB01 rmed the SE measurements. The W etch rate at 207 ° C is slightly less than one unit cell length. W has a body-centered cubic structure with a unit cell length of 3.19 Å.

The WO3 and W layer thicknesses could be determined simultaneously using SE measurements during W ALE. Figure 12 shows the concurrent SE measurements of the WO3 and W /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus the number of half-cycles at 207 ° C. The half-cycles are the O /O 2 3 oxidation reaction and the BCl /HF 3 etching reaction. The O /O3 2 exposure was 3150 mTorr s, the BCl3 exposure was 329 mTorr s, and the HF exposure was 2800 mTorr s. The ellipsometry measurements were performed after each half-cycle. The SE measurements were able to monitor both the growth and etching of the WO3 layer and the concurrent removal of the underlying W /uniFB01 lm.

With an ABC exposure sequence, the WO3 thickness is increased during W oxidization by O2/O3 and then decreased during the BCl3 and HF etching reactions. The oxidation and

(b) W thickness showing linear reduction versus number of half-cycles with an etch rate of 2.44 Å/cycle.

etching leads to an oscillatory WO3 thickness in Figure 12a versus the number of half-cycles. The increase in the WO3 thickness from oxidation is 7.2 Å/half-cycle averaged over /uniFB01 ve random half-cycles after 12 half-cycles. The decrease in the WO3 thickness from the BCl3/HF etching is 7.7 Å/half-cycle averaged over /uniFB01 ve random half-cycles after 12 half-cycles.

The WO3 thickness loss of ∼ 7.7 Å after the BCl3/HF reactions during W ALE at 207 ° C is larger than the WO3 thickness loss of ∼ 4.2 Å/cycle during WO3 ALE at 207 ° C. WO3 ALE is performed with BCl3 and HF as the reactants. W ALE is performed with O2/O3, BCl3, and HF as the reactants. The addition of the O2/O3 exposure may alter the surface species and a /uniFB00 ect the BCl3/HF reactions. Additional experiments were conducted where O2/O3 was removed from the ABC exposure sequence and WO3 ALE was performed on WO3 /uniFB01 lms produced using O2/O3. These experiments observed a WO3 etch rate of ∼ 4.2 Å/cycle that is the same as the etch rate of ∼ 4.2 Å/cycle for WO3 /uniFB01 lms produced using an O2 plasma. The WO3 etching is not dependent on the oxidant used to form the WO3 /uniFB01 lm.

Figure 12a also observes an increase in the WO3 thickness from ∼ 30 to ∼ 40 Å during the /uniFB01 rst 10 half-cycles. This increase is followed by a reduction to an oxide thickness of ∼ 20 Å after 60 half-cycles. The change in the WO3 thickness results from the competition between WO3 growth during the O2/O3 exposures and WO3 etching during the BCl3/HF reactions.

Higher or lower O2/O3 exposures were observed to result in more or less WO3 growth. The presence of a maximum WO3 thickness after 10 half-cycles in Figure 12a may be related to nucleation e /uniFB00 ects combined with the competition between WO3 growth and WO3 etching.

Concurrent ellipsometry measurements of the W thickness are shown in Figure 12b. While the WO 3 thickness is oscillating during the oxidation and etching half-cycles, the W thickness is reduced linearly versus number of half-cycles. The W etching rate is 2.44 Å/cycle. A small oscillation of the W thickness was observed over the /uniFB01 rst 30 half-cycles. The decreases in the W thickness during the half-cycles occur after the O2/O3 exposures when W is oxidized to WO3. This slight oscillation may be an artifact from the ellipsometric modeling.

An expansion of the oscillation in the WO3 thickness in Figure 12a is shown in Figure 13. The increase of the WO3

thickness during oxidation and the reduction of the WO3 thickness during etching for six consecutive half-cycles are dramatic. Values of the individual WO 3 thickness increases and decreases are given in Figure 13. In addition, the increase in the WO3 thickness from oxidation is 7.2 Å/half-cycle averaged over /uniFB01 ve random half-cycles after 12 half-cycles in Figure 12a. The decrease in the WO3 thickness from the BCl /HF etching is 7.7 3 Å/half-cycle averaged over /uniFB01 ve random half-cycles after 12 halfcycles in Figure 12a.

The ratio of the WO 3 thickness gain per half-cycle and the W thickness loss per cycle should be equal to the ratio of the WO 3 and W molar volumes. This expectation is based on conservation of tungsten mass where a W loss must equal a WO3 gain. The ratio of the WO3 gain and W loss is 7.2 (Å/halfcycle)/2.44 (Å/cycle) = 2.95. In comparison, the ratio of the molar volumes for WO3 and W is (32.4 cm /mol)/(9.5 cm / 3 3 mol) = 3.4. The ratio of the molar volumes is only slightly higher than the ratio of the etch rates. This reasonable agreement is con /uniFB01 rmation that W ALE occurs by conversion of W to WO3 followed by the etching of WO3. The slight di /uniFB00 erences in the ratios may also be explained by some WO 2 in the tungsten oxide layer. As compared to WO3, WO2 has a smaller molar volume of 20.0 cm /mol. The molar volume of a 3

mixture of WO3/WO2 would lower the ratio of the molar volumes for WO3/WO2 and W.

The self-limiting nature of the O2/O3, BCl3, and HF reactions is critical to establish a W ALE process. Self-limiting BCl3 and HF reactions have already been established during the characterization of WO3 ALE as shown in Figure 6. The selflimiting behavior of the O /O , BCl , and HF reactions during 2 3 3 W ALE also needs to be veri /uniFB01 ed to con /uniFB01 rm a self-limiting procedure for W ALE.

Figure 14 displays the W etch rate versus O /O3 2 exposure during the ABC reaction sequence at 207 ° C. The pressure of

the O2/O3 exposure was 70 mTorr for the di /uniFB00 erent exposure times of 15, 30, 45, and 60 s. HF and BCl 3 exposures were held constant at 2800 and 500 mTorr s, respectively. The HF and BCl3 pressures were 535 and 60 mTorr, respectively, during these exposures. Figure 14 shows that the W etch rate increases with O2/O3 exposure and reaches a maximum etch rate of 2.45 Å/cycle at an O /O3 2 exposure of 3150 mTorr s. The line /uniFB01 tting the data points is meant to guide the eye.

Results for the W etch rate versus BCl3 or HF exposure during W ALE at 207 ° C are shown in Figure 15a and b, respectively. These measurements were performed by varying one reactant exposure and holding the other two reactant exposures constant. BCl 3 and HF were dosed into a stream of UHP N2 that was at a pressure of 1180 mTorr. A purge of 130 s was employed after each reactant exposure. The O2/O3 exposure was 3150 mTorr s conducted at an O2/O3 pressure of 70 mTorr. A purge of 60 s was used after each O2/O3 exposure.

Figure 15a shows the results for varying the BCl 3 exposure while holding the HF and O2/O3 exposures constant at 2800 and 3150 mTorr s, respectively. The BCl3 exposures were varied from 0 to 500 mTorr s. The BCl3 exposure converts the WO3 surface to a B2O3 surface layer. The B O 2 3 surface layer is then spontaneously etched by HF. The W etch rate increases rapidly with BCl 3 exposure. With a BCl 3 exposure of 329 mTorr s, the W etch rate reaches the self-limiting W etch rate of 2.45 Å/cycle.

Figure 15b shows the results for varying the HF exposure while holding the BCl3 and O2/O3 exposures constant at 500 and 3150 mTorr s, respectively. Higher HF exposures progressively remove the B2O3 surface layer as volatile BF3 and H2O. With HF exposures of 2800 mTorr s, the W etch rate reaches the self-limiting W etch rate of 2.45 Å/cycle.

Additional experiments examined the oxidation of the W ALD /uniFB01 lms by successive O /O3 2 exposures at 207 ° C. The O2/ O3 exposures were 3150 mTorr s resulting from an O2/O3 pressure of 70 mTorr for 45 s. This is the same O /O 2 3 exposure that was employed in the W ALE experiments. The W ALD /uniFB01 lms had been exposed to atmosphere prior to loading into the reactor. The WO3 thickness on the W ALD /uniFB01 lm was then measured by SE after each O2/O3 exposure. The WO3 thickness versus number of O2/O3 exposures is displayed in Figure 16.

The initial WO3 thickness in Figure 16 is ∼ 33 Å. This thickness is close to the native oxide thicknesses on tungsten that have been measured earlier with XPS and XRR analysis. 48,49 The WO3 thickness is nearly constant at ∼ 33 Å after the /uniFB01 rst three O2/O3 exposures. This constant oxide thickness may be related to the O2/O3 exposure cleaning

residual carbon from the surface. Figure 16 then shows that the WO3 thickness increases consistently after the third O2/O3 exposure. However, the increase is progressively reduced after each O2/O3 exposure. This behavior is suggestive of di /uniFB00 usionlimited oxidation when the surface oxide acts as a barrier for oxidation of the underlying W metal. Similar behavior is also observed for the di /uniFB00 usion-limited oxidation of silicon described by the Deal -Grove model. 62 The WO3 thickness is ∼ 66 Å after 34 O2/O3 exposures. XPS analysis of the WO3 /uniFB01 lm produced by these O2/O3 exposures was consistent with stoichiometric WO3 with W in the 6+ oxidation state.

The larger WO3 thicknesses produced by greater number of sequential O /O3 2 exposures may lead to W etch rates that are higher after larger O /O 2 3 exposures. However, Figure 14 shows that the W etch rate is self-limiting versus O2/O3 exposure. This behavior suggests that the W ALE is self-limiting because of the self-limiting BCl3 and HF reactions. Larger O2/O3 exposures may lead to larger WO3 /uniFB01 lm thicknesses. However, the WO3 removal is still limited by the self-limiting BCl3 and HF reactions. The BCl3 and HF reactions may only remove a fraction of the WO 3 /uniFB01 lm. After partial removal of the WO 3 /uniFB01 lm, the next O2/O3 exposure would then reestablish a larger WO 3 /uniFB01 lm thickness that is consistent with the O /O 2 3 exposure.

Additional experiments were performed at 207 ° C by varying the O2/O3 exposure times with an O /O3 2 pressure of 70 mTorr under self-limiting conditions for the BCl3 and HF reactions. O2/O3 exposure times of 45 and 60 s both produced W ALE etch rates of 2.45 Å/cycle. However, the WO3 /uniFB01 lm thickness was ∼ 20 Å for the 45 s O /O3 2 exposures (3150 mTorr s) and ∼ 30 Å for the 60 s O /O 2 3 exposures (4200 mTorr s) after &gt;20 reaction cycles. The consequence of larger O2/O3 exposure times at constant O /O3 2 pressures is thicker WO 3 thicknesses during W ALE. However, the W ALE etch rates remain the same. These results argue that W ALE is self-limiting because of the self-limiting BCl 3 and HF reactions.

Figure 12a shows that the WO3 thickness is reduced to a thickness of ∼ 20 Å after 60 half-cycles during W ALE with an O2/O3 pressure of 70 mTorr and O2/O3 exposure time of 45 s under self-limiting conditions for the BCl3 and HF reactions. Removal of this WO3 layer on W may be important for applications where no oxide is desired for proper device function. This WO3 layer can be removed by stopping the O / 2 O3 exposures and utilizing an AB reaction sequence with BCl 3 and HF exposures. Figure 17a displays the removal of the WO 3

Figure 17. WO3 removal after W ALE using BCl3 and HF as reactants. (a) WO3 thickness versus number of cycles showing reduction of WO3 thickness to limiting value of ∼ 3 Å. (b) W thickness versus number of cycles showing that W thickness remains nearly constant during WO 3 removal.

layer after W ALE versus the number of BCl3/HF reaction cycles using the self-limiting reaction conditions for WO 3 ALE at 207 ° C. The WO3 layer thickness is reduced in thickness from 20 Å to a limiting thickness of ∼ 3 Å after &gt;12 reaction cycles.

The corresponding W /uniFB01 lm thickness during the removal of the WO3 layer is shown in Figure 17b. While the WO 3 layer is removed during the AB reaction sequence, the W /uniFB01 lm thickness is nearly constant. The initial W /uniFB01 lm thickness is ∼ 218 Å. The W lm thickness reaches 215 /uniFB01 -216 Å after &gt;12 reaction cycles. These results indicate that the WO 3 layer on W can be removed with almost no e /uniFB00 ect on the W thickness. There are also alternative methods to remove the WO3 layer based on hydrogen reduction using H2 or H2 plasma exposures. 59,64,66

The self-limiting conditions for the BCl 3 and HF exposures during WO3 ALE at 207 ° C were 325 and 200 mTorr s, respectively. In comparison, the self-limiting conditions for the O2/O3, BCl3, and HF exposures during W ALE at 207 ° C were 3150, 325, and 2800 mTorr s, respectively. The self-limiting conditions for the HF exposure are very di /uniFB00 erent for WO3 and W ALE. The inclusion of the O2/O3 exposure in the ABC reaction sequence for W ALE leads to a much larger selflimiting HF exposure. The chamber walls are coated with Al O 2 3

ALD, and HF is known to adsorb on Al2O3 at the chamber wall temperature of 170 ° C. 16 The O2/O3 exposure may remove HF from the chamber walls. Larger HF exposures may then be required during the subsequent BCl3/HF reaction to replace the adsorbed HF and obtain self-limiting behavior.

3.3. Extension to Additional Materials. The ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanisms can be useful for the ALE of a variety of additional metal materials. These mechanisms will be valuable because some metal materials cannot be etched using the /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange mechanism. 15,19 Fluorination of many metal materials is not thermodynamically favorable with HF. However, stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactants, like SF4 and XeF2, can lead to volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides and spontaneous etching. The highly exothermic reaction of stronger /uniFB02 uorination reagents with metal materials can also lead to /uniFB02 uoride layers too thick for ALE. Some metal materials are also di /uniFB03 cult to /uniFB02 uorinate because they do not have stable /uniFB02 uorides in the same oxidation state as the initial metal material. Other metal materials can be /uniFB02 uorinated but do not easily yield volatile products during the ligand-exchange reaction.

BCl3 is important for the conversion of many initial metal oxides to B O3 2 because B2O3 is a stable metal oxide and many metals have volatile chlorides or oxychlorides. Metals with volatile chlorides or oxychlorides include W, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, Fe, Au, Ga, Ge, Sn, As, Sb, Zr and Hf. The spontaneous etching of B2O3 by HF also plays a key role in the new conversion etching mechanisms. HF can spontaneously etch B2O3. However, HF cannot spontaneously etch many other metal oxides. Consequently, if the initial metal oxide can be converted to B2O3, then HF can spontaneously etch B2O3 and the underlying initial metal oxide will serve as an etch stop.

Table 1 explores the thermochemistry of a variety of conversion reactions for various metal oxides. Most of these metal oxides will have di /uniFB03 culty achieving self-limiting ALE using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. The reasons for the di /uniFB03 culty include: (1) formation of volatile /uniFB02 uorides that lead to spontaneous etching (WO3, MoO3, VO2, V2O5, Ta2O5, GeO2, As2O3, Au2O3, SbO2, Sb2O3, and NbO2); (2) lack of volatile products after ligand-exchange reaction with various metal precursors (Fe O ); and (3) absence of 2 3 /uniFB02 uoride with the same oxidation state as the initial metal oxide (CrO3). All of these metal oxides have volatile chlorides or oxychlorides and should be converted to B2O3 using BCl3 based on thermochemical calculations. SnO2, Ga2O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 ALE are possible using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. 20,21 These metal oxides are included in Table 1 because they have volatile chlorides or oxychlorides and could be etched using the ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism as an alternative.

The thermochemistry of most of these reactions in Table 1 is favorable as measured by the standard free energy changes. The examples in Table 1 use either BCl3 or B(CH3)3 for the conversion reaction to form B2O3. The choice of BCl3 or B(CH3)3 depends on the volatility of the reaction products. In addition, the ligand on the boron center can also lead to selective ALE. 21 The thermochemical calculations reveal that Ga2O3 cannot be converted to B2O3 using B(CH3)3. Consequently, B(CH3)3 could be used to etch In O3, 2 GeO2, As2O3, and SnO2 without etching Ga2 O3.

The conversion of metal oxides to other metal oxides besides B2O3 is also possible. One possibility is the conversion of metal oxides to TiO2 using TiCl4. Fluorination of TiO2 using HF

exposures would then spontaneously etch TiO2 by producing volatile TiF 4 and H2O reaction products. 67 TiCl4 may not be as useful as BCl3 for conversion etch. The thermochemistry of conversion of metal oxides to TiO2 using TiCl4 is not as favorable as the thermochemistry of conversion of metal oxides to B O3 2 using BCl3 . However, the conversion of the surface of a metal oxide to a TiO2 surface layer may be useful for device applications to avoid a TiO 2 ALD processing step.

## 4. CONCLUSIONS

The thermal ALE of WO3 and W was demonstrated with new etching procedures using ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanisms. These procedures are important because earlier thermal ALE processes have utilized /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions that require the formation of a stable metal /uniFB02 uoride. In contrast, the new mechanisms are applicable for metal materials with volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides. Some elemental metals also require initial oxidation reactions because /uniFB02 uorination is very robust and leads to /uniFB02 uoride layers too thick for ALE.

The ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism using an AB exposure sequence with BCl3 and HF as the reactants was employed for WO3 ALE. BCl3 converts the WO3 surface to a B2O3 layer and is believed to form volatile WO Cl 2 2 as a reaction product. The B2 O3 layer is then spontaneously etched by HF to produce volatile BF3 and H2O. The BCl3 and HF reactions

were both self-limiting versus exposure. The WO3 ALE etch rates were temperature dependent and increased from 0.55 Å/ cycle at 128 ° C to 4.19 Å/cycle at 207 ° C. The W /uniFB01 lm acted as an etch stop because BCl3 and HF could not etch the underlying W /uniFB01 lm.

The ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanism using an ABC exposure sequence with O2/O3, BCl3, and HF as the reactants was employed for W ALE. O2/O3 /uniFB01 rst oxidizes the W surface to a WO 3 layer. The WO3 layer is then etched with BCl 3 and HF. The SE measurements could monitor simultaneously the W and WO3 thicknesses during W ALE. The WO3 thickness is oscillatory and increases during W oxidation and decreases during WO3 etching. Concurrently, the W /uniFB01 lm thickness decreased linearly with number of ABC reaction cycles. W ALE was self-limiting with respect to each reaction in the ABC process. The etch rate for W ALE was ∼ 2.5 Å/cycle at 207 ° C. The residual WO3 thickness of ∼ 20 Å after W ALE could be removed with BCl3 and HF reaction cycles without a /uniFB00 ecting the W layer.

These new etching mechanisms based on ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidation-conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' should be useful for the thermal ALE of a variety of materials. The conversion and /uniFB02 uorination reactions using BCl 3 and HF can be applied to many metal oxide materials including the oxides of W, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, Fe, Au, Ga, Ge, Sn, As, Sb, Zr, and Hf. The metals in these metal oxides can be converted to B O 2 3 by BCl3 and have metal chlorides and metal oxychlorides that are volatile. The new ' conversion/uniFB02 uorination ' and ' oxidationconversion/uniFB02 uorination ' mechanisms will be particularly valuable for providing ALE pathways for metals and metal oxides that have volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides.
