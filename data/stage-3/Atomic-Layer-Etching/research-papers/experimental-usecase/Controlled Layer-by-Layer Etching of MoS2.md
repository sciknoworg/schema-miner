ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) metal dichalcogenides like molybdenum disul /uniFB01 de (MoS2) may provide a pathway to high-mobility channel materials that are needed for beyondcomplementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Controlling the thickness of these materials at the atomic level will be a key factor in the future development of MoS 2 devices. In this study, we propose a layer-by-layer removal of MoS2 using the atomic layer etching (ALET) that is composed of the cyclic processing of chlorine (Cl)-radical adsorption and argon (Ar) + ion-beam desorption. MoS2 etching was not observed with only the Cl-radical adsorption or low-energy (&lt;20 eV) Ar + ion-beam desorption steps; however, the use of sequential

etching that is composed of the Cl-radical adsorption step and a subsequent Ar + ion-beam desorption step resulted in the complete etching of one monolayer of MoS2. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated the removal of one monolayer of MoS2 with each ALET cycle; therefore, the number of MoS2 layers could be precisely controlled by using this cyclical etch method. In addition, no noticeable damage or etch residue was observed on the exposed MoS2.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Molybdenum disul /uniFB01 de (MoS2) is a typical layer-structured composite metal dichalcogenide composed of a S -Mo -S crystal structure and is one of the newly investigated twodimensional (2D) electronic materials that is similar to graphene. 1 -7 van der Waals force is dominant between the layers, while covalent bonds control the interaction within the layers. 8 -12 MoS2 is a semiconducting material, and di /uniFB00 erent band gap energies have been found for di /uniFB00 erent numbers of MoS2 layers. As the layers of material decrease, the band gap is enhanced from 1.29 to 1.8 eV (a monolayer is due to the quantum con /uniFB01 nement e /uniFB00 ect). At the same time, with a decrease of the number of layers, a tendency from the indirect gap to the direct gap is observed between the conduction band and the valence band.

semiconductor nanodevices. 13 The volume of MoS2 is smaller than that of an Si crystal structure, and the mass of MoS2 is lighter than the Si crystal structure when it obtains the same electron-mobility e /uniFB00 ect. At a steady state, the energy consumption is known to be lower than that of traditional Si transistors. 14 Moreover, MoS2 is investigated as a promising material for hydrogen evolution, 15 transistors, 16,17 and sensors, 18 in addition to /uniFB02 exible electronics due to a high Young s modulus of approximately 33 TPa. ' 19

MoS2 has a stable crystal structure, does not react with strong acids, and has an electron mobility that can reach 200 cm 2 V -1 s -1 at room temperature. 11,12 MoS2-monolayer /uniFB01 eld-e /uniFB00 ect transistors that have been fabricated with hafnium(IV) oxide (HfO2) as the gate dielectric show a current on/o /uniFB00 ratio as high as 1 × 10 8 at room temperature and a very low standby-power dissipation; therefore, it can be used in the fabrication of 2D

The electronic properties of 2D materials and their application strongly depend on the number of layers; therefore, a simple and e /uniFB03 cient method to control thickness is necessary. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is widely investigated regarding the growth of large-area MoS2, but currently, it is di /uniFB03 cult to control the layers of MoS , especially 2 for a low layer number, with this method. At present, only MoS2 devices that use a MoS 2 /uniFB02 ake obtained by exfoliation have a proven reliability. 13,17

Instead of the control of MoS 2 layers by growth, MoS 2 layers can be controlled by removing the layers after synthesis. Recently, the use of argon (Ar) plasma to conduct the layer-bylayer etching of MoS2 has been investigated by Liu et al., and the results showed the possibility of using sputter etching to achieve a monolayer MoS2; however, their etching process resulted in physical damage to the sample surface, as detected by Raman spectroscopy. 15,20 Huang et al. controlled the MoS 2 layer thickness by using xenon di /uniFB02 uoride (XeF2) etching, which formed volatile etch products such as molybdenum hexa/uniFB02 uoride (MoF6) and sulfur hexa /uniFB02 uoride (SF6) without damaging the sample. 11 Castellanos-Gomez et al. reported the use of a laser thinning technique on a multilayer MoS 2 /uniFB01 lm to achieve a monolayer, but this method showed drawbacks such as thermal damage to the bottom layer. 21 Thermal-annealing and oxygen-treatment methods have also been reported as approaches that can thin MoS2. 14,15,22 On the basis of an analysis of all of the currently reported techniques, however, the removed MoS2 depth can only be controlled by etch time, and a precise control of the number of MoS2 layers at the atomic scale cannot be achieved.

Previously, in the etching of various semiconducting materials, the atomic layer etching technique (ALET) has shown promising results for next-generation devices due to characteristics such as precise atomic-scale control of the etch depth, extreme uniformity over a large wafer area, and low levels of damage and contamination. 23 -26 In this research, we propose the ALET as a precise layer-by-layer etching technique for 2D MoS2 material. Using ALET, we investigated the possibility of removing one monolayer of MoS2 through the chemical absorption and physical desorption of the cyclic reaction. Also, the possibility of obtaining one monolayer of MoS2 from a trilayer MoS2 formation without inducing damage and contamination on the remaining MoS2 layers was explored.

## 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

The 2D MoS2 layers that had been synthesized using the CVD method (shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information) were etched layer by layer using a two-step ALET. First, chlorine radicals that were generated from an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system were adsorbed onto the MoS2 surface. Then, the chlorinated MoS 2 surface was removed using a low-energy Ar + ion beam.

During Cl-radical adsorption, ion bombardment was signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced by installing a grounded, metal mesh grid between the ICP source and the substrate. The Cl 2 plasma for adsorption was generated with 63 sccm of Cl 2 and 18 W 13.56 MHz radio frequency (rf) source power at 10 mTorr pressure. For the desorption step, the samples were transferred to a dual-grid Ar + ion-beam system. The process conditions were 70 sccm of Ar, 200 W 13.56 MHz ICP power, and 6.7 mTorr pressure. An extraction grid voltage of between +10 and +100 V was used to accelerate the Ar + ion, while the outside grid of the ionbeam system was grounded. (For schematic diagrams of the ICP systems used for the adsorption of the Cl radical and the Ar -ion-beam + system used to desorb the chemisorbed MoS2 layer, see Figure S2, (a) and (b).) The ion /uniFB02 ux and energy distribution of the Ar + ion beam were measured using a quadruple mass spectrometer with an ion energy analyzer (Hiden Analytical Ltd., EQP1000) that was located close to the sample location (shown in Figure S2, (b)).

The numbers of MoS2 layers before and after the layer-by-layer etching were estimated using Raman spectroscopy (WITEC 2000, 532 nm wavelength, installed with a grating of 1800 grooves/m and a spectral center of 600 cm -1 ). The thickness was determined by measuring the shift of the Raman peaks at the E 1 2g and A1g peaks. The thickness of the MoS2 was also measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, INOVA microscope by Bruker) and a sample patterned by photoresist; the photoresist was removed before the measurement with AFM. The chemical binding states of the MoS2 surface before and after the Cl-radical adsorption and before and after the Ar + ion desorption were observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo VG, Multilab 2000).

## 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The schematic diagram of the atomic layer etching of MoS2 using the adsorption of Cl radicals and the desorption of Cladsorbed MoS2 is shown in Figure 1. Since Cl is a better

oxidizing agent than S, the adsorbed Cl on the MoS2 surface weakens the covalent bonding between the outermost electrons in Mo 4d 5 5s 1 and S 3s . The bond angle is changed and the 6 bond length is increased by the movement of Mo electrons toward the surface Cl atom; therefore, the adsorption of Cl on MoS2 not only changes the Mo -S binding energy but also decreases the van der Waals force between the MoS2 layers. 27 -29 The weakened Cl-adsorbed MoS2 top layer was physically desorbed by the ion bombardment from a lowenergy Ar + ion beam during the desorption step. The Ar + ion bombardment not only breaks the Mo -S binding in the layer but also removes the broken MoS-Cl/S -Cl from the MoS2 surface. This process will continue until all of the broken MoS -Cl/S -Cl species are removed and the next MoS2 layer is exposed.

During Cl-radical adsorption, the MoS 2 layer should not be chemically etched by the plasma etching, which involves the synergic e /uniFB00 ect of Cl-radical adsorption and Cl + ion bombardment. The removal of these reactive Cl + ions is accomplished by the grounded, metal mesh grid that was installed between the ion beam and wafer surface, as shown in Figure S2. Figure 2 shows the Raman spectra of one monolayer of MoS2 before and after Cl-radical exposure. The monolayer MoS2 surface was exposed to the Cl radicals for 2 and 10 min. As shown in Figure 2, for the pristine MoS , two peaks related to the E 2 1 2g and A1g peaks of the MoS2 crystal were observed at 386.4 cm -1 (inplane vibration mode) and 406.1 cm -1 (out-of-plane vibration mode), respectively; therefore, the gap between the two peaks was about 19.7 cm -1 , indicating the monolayer MoS2. The width of the Raman peaks of the monolayer MoS2 that was measured after the Cl-radical exposures of 2 and 10 min was not changed; therefore, the Cl exposure did not etch the monolayer MoS2.

During the desorption step, the weakened Cl-adsorbed MoS2 bonds were broken and desorbed by the Ar + ion bombardment.

Ion-energy control is critical for the desorption of the Clmodi ed /uniFB01 MoS2 surface. If the energy is too high, then the unreacted MoS2 is damaged; conversely, if the ion energy is too low, no amount of material is removed. During the Ar + ion exposure for the desorption step, the energy of the Ar + ion was varied to investigate the Ar + ion-energy window during the desorption step. Figure 3a shows the Raman spectra of the monolayer MoS2 before and after the Ar + ion exposure at di /uniFB00 erent grid voltages, which controls the energy of the Ar + ions bombarding the MoS2 surface. As shown in the /uniFB01 gure, when the MoS2 was exposed to the Ar + ion source for 2 min with a grid voltage higher than +30 V, no Raman peaks were observed, indicating that the MoS2 was removed. However, when the MoS2 was exposed to the Ar + ion beam using a grid voltage of +10 V for 2 and 10 min, no change was observed. This indicates that there was no change to the MoS 2 material when +10 V was used to accelerate the Ar + ion beam. Figure 3b shows the Ar + ion-energy distribution that was measured using an ion-energy analyzer during the Ar + ion-desorption step for di /uniFB00 erent grid voltages between +10 and +70 V. As shown in Figure 3b, the ion energy distribution for +10 V grid voltage showed a nearly monoenergetic Ar + ion beam, with an energy peak at approximately +20 eV (10 -25 eV).

Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra in sequence following the previously described optimized-process step on the monolayer MoS2 sample. For the Cl-radical adsorption step, 2 min of Clradical exposure time was used, and for the Ar + ion desorption step, 2 min exposure time with +10 V of grid voltage was used. As previously shown, no change was detected in the peak width between the pristine and Cl-exposed steps; however, when the Cl-modi /uniFB01 ed MoS2 was exposed to the Ar + ion-desorption step, no peaks were detected, indicating that the monolayer MoS2 was completely removed. It is therefore expected that during the Cl-adsorption step, the MoS 2 binding energy is weakened by chlorine adsorbing onto the MoS2 and is then removed during the desorption step by the controlled Ar + ion energy.

Controlled thinning of multilayer MoS2 may be possible using the above-described process. To demonstrate, a trilayer MoS2 sample was exposed to three cycles of ALET and Raman spectra were collected between each step. Figure 5a and Figure 5b show the Raman spectra and the peak distance between the E 1 2g and A1g peaks, respectively, as the process progresses through each step. It is known that with a decrease of the MoS 2

' X5 ' means that the actual ionenergy distribution of +10 V is 5 times smaller than that shown in the /uniFB01 gure.

layer thickness, the peak distance between the E 1 2g and A1g peaks is decreased to a speci /uniFB01 c value, depending on the number of MoS2 layers. 6,11,12,16,30 As shown in Figure 5a and Figure 5b, during the Cl-adsorption step, the peak distance does not change; however, after each Ar + ion-desorption step, the gap

between the E 1 2g and A1g peaks decreased by a speci /uniFB01 c value related to monolayer-to-bilayer MoS . (In addition to the CVD 2 MoS2, a similar ALET experiment was carried out using trilayer MoS2 /uniFB02 akes obtained from crystal MoS . The trilayer MoS 2 2 was etched using the same ALET cycle, and after one ALET cycle, the peak distance decreased to the speci /uniFB01 c value related to bilayer MoS2. See Figure S3.) Also, when the MoS 2 structure is distorted by the physical ion bombardment, the E 2 1u peak near 379 cm -1 is known to appear because of the Raman edge e /uniFB00 ect that is caused by the distortion of the MoS 2 structure, 6,16,30 but as shown in Figure 5a, no such peak was observed. It can therefore be understood that during each ALET cycle, one monolayer MoS2 was completely removed without noticeably damaging the exposed MoS2 underlayer.

In addition to Raman spectroscopy, the change of the MoS 2 layer during the ALET cycles was measured using AFM. For this measurement, a trilayer MoS2 /uniFB01 lm was masked with photoresist and exposed to one and two ALET cycles. The photoresist was removed by acetone, and the step was measured using AFM. Figure 6a) and Figure 6b show the AFM data after a single cycle of ALET for the monolayer MoS 2 and two cycles of ALET for the trilayer MoS , respectively. As 2 shown in Figure 6a, after one ALET cycle, the measured etch step of the MoS 2 was about 0.7 nm, which is a little thicker than the theoretical value of 0.65 nm. Previous investigations have shown that because of the trapping of H2O on the SiO2 substrate, the monolayer MoS 2 thickness may be slightly greater than the theoretical value; 30,31 therefore, we believe that one MoS2 layer was completely etched after one ALET cycle. After the two cycles of ALET, as shown in Figure 6b, about 1.52 nm

Figure 6. AFM step height (a) after one ALET cycle of one monolayer of MoS2 and (b) after two ALET cycles of trilayer MoS . The MoS2 2 was patterned with a photoresist, and the photoresist was removed after the ALET for the measurement of the step height using AFM. The big step heights at the boundary (two bright lines on the optical microscopic picture) are due to the photoresist residue remaining even after the photoresist removal to measure the etch step after two ALET cycles.

of etch depth, which is close to the thickness of two MoS2 layers, was observed.

Figure 7 shows the narrow-scan XPS data of (a) Mo, (b) S, and (c) Cl that were measured during each step of the three cycles of ALET for the trilayer MoS . As shown in Figure 7a, 2 the peaks at 229.5 and 232.6 eV that relate to the orbital binding energy of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 were observed after the third Cl-adsorption step; but after the third desorption step, these peaks were removed and distorted. We believe that the remaining peak of Mo after the third Ar + ion-desorption step is related to the di /uniFB00 usion of the Mo into the SiO 2 or the oxidized Mo particle on the SiO2, because the peak positions of the remaining Mo after the third Ar + ion-desorption step are

exactly matched with those of the Mo 3d 3/2 (236.3 eV) and Mo 3d5/2 (232.6 eV) that are related to MoO . Figure 7b shows the 3 two peaks at 162.3 and 165.6 eV that are related to the binding energy of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 . These peaks are present throughout the third Cl-adsorption step but are not detected after the third Ar + exposure, indicating the complete removal of the third MoS2 layer. 32 In the case of Cl, the large peak at 200.2 eV was only observed after the Cl-adsorption step; this peak was not detected after the Ar + ion-desorption step, indicating that the Cl adsorption on the MoS2 during the radicaladsorption step was removed during the Ar + ion desorption. From the XPS results, the precise removal of one MoS 2 layer by one ALET cycle from the use of this method is therefore expected.

In the XPS narrow-scan data of Mo in Figure 7a, an additional peak at 227 eV is also shown and it remains until the Cl-adsorption step of the third ALET cycle. We found that this peak is related to the 2D MoS2 structure, and when the 2D MoS2 structure is damaged, the peak intensity decreased in addition to the emergence of an additional peak at 236 eV related to Mo 6+ (see Figure S4). In the case of S, when the MoS2 is damaged, the S 2p1/2 peak decreased (see Figure S4); however, as shown in Figure 7a and Figure 7b, the peak related to the 2D MoS2 structure was not removed, and no peak related to the Mo 6+ was observed until the Ar + ion-desorption step of the third ALET cycle. Also, a decrease of the S 2p 1/2 peak was not found until the third ALET cycle. It is therefore believed that by using this ALET, a multilayer MoS2 can be etched precisely layer-by-layer without noticeably damaging the exposed MoS2 underlayer.

## 4. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that the thickness of a multilayer MoS 2 can be controlled layer-by-layer using Cl-radical adsorption and Ar + ion desorption in accordance with the ALET. Raman spectra, AFM data, and XPS data suggest that one monolayer of MoS2 can be etched with one ALET cycle; therefore, the precise control of the etch layer can presumably be achieved using the ALET. Moreover, no Cl residue and no noticeable damage were found on the remaining MoS2 underlayer after each ALET cycle. We believe that this ALET method can also be applicable when precisely controlling the layers of other 2D materials such as MoSe2, WS2, and BN; therefore, it can be utilized as a useful engineering tool for controlling the properties of next-generation 2D devices without inducing residue and damage.
