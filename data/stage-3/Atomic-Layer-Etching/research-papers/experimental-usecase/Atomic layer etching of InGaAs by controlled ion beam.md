## Abstract

Atomic layer etching (ALE) could be an important next­generation etching technique, applicable to various semiconductor materials including III -V compound materials such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) which has high carrier mobility, an advantageous characteristic in nanoscale electronic devices. In this study, the ALE characteristics of InGaAs have been investigated using a reactive ion beam technique. For the ALE of InGaAs, chlorine radicals/low­energy (10 -19 eV) reactive ions and low­energy (5 -8 eV) Ar + ions were used for adsorption and desorption, respectively, during the etch cycle to precisely control the etch depth and to minimize the surface damage of the InGaAs. By using the ALE technique, a constant etch rate of 1.1 Å /cycle could be obtained for InGaAs, as well as an infinite etch selectivity of InGaAs over various materials such as photoresist, silicon, amorphous carbon layer, SiO2, and HfO2. The surface composition and surface roughness of the InGaAs after ALE were similar to those of as­received un­etched InGaAs.

## 1.  Introduction

Among  the  various  III -V  compound  semiconducting  mat­ erials, indium -gallium  arsenide  (InGaAs)  has  been  most widely investigated for use in various devices, such as elec­ tronic devices and optical devices, due to its excellent elec­ trical properties such as high carrier mobility and direct energy band structure [1 -4]. Recently, InGaAs has attracted attention as a potential candidate material for a new channel layer for a high­speed and low­power III -V based metal -oxide -semi­ conductor field­effect transistor (MOSFET) [1]. In particular, it is a possible candidate for the gate material in the structure of  next­generation semiconductor devices, such as fin­field­ effect transistors (FinFETs) and nanowire field­effect transis­ tors (NWFETs), which consist of 3D device structures which https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/aa70c8

can be maintained even with a short gate length because of the control of the short­channel effect and near ideal turn­off slope [5 -7].

In the past, chemical etching has been widely used for the fabrication  of  III -V  based  semiconductor  devices  because it  allows  high  etch  rates  without  surface  damage, but it has disadvantages,  such  as  difficulty  in  controlling  etch  rates and undercutting due to the isotropic etching. Therefore, as the device scale has decreased, dry etching such as reactive ion etching (RIE), has also been investigated for anisotropic etching  of  III -V compound materials [8 -13]. When RIE is used to etch III -V compound materials, the materials can be easily  damaged  by  the  reactive  ions  and  the  device  perfor­ mance can be easily degraded even though more controllable etch rates and anisotropic etch profiles are obtained [14].

the  fabrication  of  nanoscale  FinFETs  and  NWFETs  in  par­ ticular, more controlled etch rates and near damageless etching is required in addition to the anisotropic etching. Therefore, in order to overcome the problems of conventional dry etching techniques  in  nanoscale  devices,  the  atomic  layer  etching (ALE) technique, which is a cyclic etch process composed of an adsorption step (the chemisorption of reactive gas species on the material s surface) and a desorption step (the removal ' of  the  chemisorbed  species  by  various  methods)  has  been investigated recently.Even though the etch rate is very slow, it is the most suitable method for nanoscale etching, with a pre­ cise etch rate in the atomic scale and with negligible physical and chemical damage on the etched material s surface. '

For  III -V  compound  based  semiconductors,  ALE  tech­ niques  have  also  been  investigated  using  various  methods. Due to the volatile compound formation of chlorine with III -V compound  materials,  as  the  adsorption  gas,  chlorine­based reactive gas radicals have generally been used. However, for the desorption of chemisorbed gas species, an energetic Ar/ Ne ion/neutral beam (Ar ion for GaAs [15] and Ne neutral beam for  GaAs  [16]  and  InP  [17]),  KrF  excimer  laser  (for GaAs [18]), halogen lamp (for InP [19]), etc has been used. For  the  electron­beam­generated  energetic Ar  ions  with  an energy of ­17 eV, the saturated etch depth of ~0.142 nm/cycle, which corresponds to one atomic layer/cycle for GaAs (1 0 0), was observed by Meguro et al [15], and, by using a Ne neu­ tral  beam ( &gt; 10 V), the saturated etch depths of ~0.163 nm/ cycle for GaAs (1 1 1) and ~0.141 nm/cycle for GaAs (1 0 0) were obtained by Lim et al [16]. In the case of InP, by using a Ne neutral beam ( &gt; 5 V), the saturated InP etch depths of ~0.169 nm/cycle for InP (1 1 1) and ~0.147 nm/cycle for InP (1  0  0) could also be achieved [17]. The use of a 248 nm KrF excimer  laser  for  the  desorption  of  chlorine  chemisorbed GaAs  during  ALE  yielded  the  saturated  etch  amount  of ~0.2 nm/cycle [18]. In the case of Otsuka et al [19], instead of chlorine, trisdimethylaminophosphorus was injected digi­ tally while the substrate was heated using a halogen lamp for the digital etching, and the saturated etch depth of ~0.05 nm/ cycle was observed. Among these ALE desorption methods, the  desorption  with  the Ar/Ne  ion/neutral  beam  resulted  in anisotropic etching while other desorption methods, such as with a KrF excimer laser, and with a halogen lamp, resulted in isotropic etching.

Even  though  the  above  previous  studies  on  III -V  com­ pounds  exhibit  the  feasibility  of  ALE  for  III -V  compound materials, these previous ALE studies are limited to binary­ component III -V compounds; ALE on three­component com­ pounds has never been investigated and the etch selectivities over  various  semiconductor  related  materials  during  ALE have  not  yet  been  reported  either.  Therefore,  in  this  study, as a feasibility study of an anisotropic ALE for three­comp­ onent III -V compounds, the ALE characteristics of InGaAs, which is one of the most promising gate materials for next­ generation FinFETs and NWFETs, has been investigated. For the ALE method, a cycle process composed of an adsorption step  with  chlorine  radical/low­energy  ions  and  a  desorption step with a low energy Ar + ion beam was used. In addition to the ALE of InGaAs, at an optimized ALE condition, the final

etch  selectivities  of  InGaAs  over  various  materials  such  as photoresist (PR), amorphous carbon layer (ACL), SiO2, and HfO2 were also investigated.

## 2.  Experimental

As  the  InGaAs  sample  for  ALE,  In0.53Ga0.47As  (200 nm)/ InP (1000 nm)/GaAs (300 nm) grown on silicon substrate by metal organic chemical vapor deposition was used. Prior to loading in the chamber, the InGaAs sample was dipped in a HCl solution to remove native oxide on the InGaAs surface, followed by rising with de­ionized (DI) water and drying with nitrogen gas. To investigate the etch selectivities over various materials, mask materials such as PR and ACL and dielectric materials such as SiO2, HfO2 deposited on silicon wafer were prepared and also etched together during the ALE of InGaAs.

Figures  1(a)  and  (b)  show  the  process  steps  in  the ALE cycles  and  the  ion  beam  source  used  for  the  InGaAs ALE, respectively. As shown in figure 1(a), one ALE cycle was com­ posed of four sequential steps; the first step (adsorption step) was for the adsorption (reaction) of chlorine reactant species

on the surface and the third step (desorption step) was for the desorption (removal) of surface atoms -reactant chemisorbed species on the surface, and the second and fourth steps were for the purging of residual reactant and purging of desorbed chemisorbed species from the surface, respectively. As shown in figure 1(b), a three­grid inductively coupled plasma (ICP)­ type ion source operated at a 13.56 MHz radio frequency (RF) was used as the source for adsorption and desorption. In this three­grid assembly, a positive voltage was applied to the first grid  located  close  to  the  source  (acceleration  grid)  for  the ion energy control and a negative voltage was applied to the second grid located between the first grid and the third grid for ion beam flux control and electron shielding. The third grid was grounded.

For the adsorption step, 200 W of RF power was applied to  the  ICP  source for 2.5 -20 s  at  a  constant  Cl 2  pressure of about 1.0 mTorr in the processing chamber and the first grid voltage was varied from + 5 to + 30 V while keeping -20 V to the second grid for the extraction of low energy chlorine ions/ radicals and to chemisorb chlorine on the InGaAs surface. For the desorption step, 200 W of RF power was also applied to the ICP source for 50 s with a constant Ar pressure of about 3.0 mTorr in the processing chamber and the first grid voltage was varied from + 10 to + 50 V while keeping the second grid voltage at -100 V for the extraction of the directional Ar + ion beam and to desorb the chemisorbed species. N2 gas flow for 20 s was used for purging both after the adsorption and after the  desorption.  The  substrate  temperature  was  maintained at -20 ° C for the effective adsorption of chlorine species on the InGaAs surface.

To  measure  the  etch  rate  (etch  depth/cycle)  during  the ALE,  the  samples  patterned  with  PR  were  etched  for  100 cycles and the total etch depths were estimated using a sur­ face profilometer (Tencor Instruments, Alpha­Step 500) after the removal of PR. The measured etch depth was divided by the  total  number  of ALE  cycles  to  yield  the  etch  rate.  The change in surface roughness was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM; Bruker Innova). To analyze the Ar + ion energy of the ions extracted from the ICP ion source through the three­grid, a homemade retarding grid ion energy analyzer equipped with a current meter (Keithley 2400) and a voltage meter (Hewlett Packard 34401A) was installed at the wafer location. Also, the surface composition of InGaAs was ana­ lyzed  by  x­ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS;  Thermo VG, MultiLab 2000, Mg K α source).

## 3.  Results and discussion

First,  the  degree  of  adsorption  of  chlorine  on  the  InGaAs surface during the adsorption step for ALE was investigated using XPS by increasing the adsorption time from 2.5 to 20 s, while operating the ICP power at 200 W at Cl2 1.0 mTorr of the  process  chamber. The  grid  voltages  to  the  ICP  ion  gun were maintained at + 10 V for the first grid and at -20 V for the second grid. The adsorption process condition was optim­ ized  for  the ALE  investigation.  Figure  2  shows  the  relative atomic percentages among In, Ga, and As in InGaAs, and the

The power to the ICP ion source was 200 W at Cl2 1.0 mTorr of process chamber pressure. The grid voltages to the ICP ion gun were maintained at + 10 V for the first grid and -20 V for the second grid.

atomic percentage of Cl on the InGaAs surface measured by XPS as a function of Cl adsorption time. As shown in figure 2, in the case of In, Ga, and As, as the chlorine adsorption time is increased, no changes of relative atomic percentage among In:Ga:As were observed, indicating no preferential etching of In, Ga, or As on the InGaAs surface during the adsorption up to 20 s. However, in the case of chlorine, the chlorine atomic percentage was increased on the InGaAs surface as adsorption time increased, until the 10  s, and saturated at about 16%. The coverage of chlorine on the InGaAs surface could be higher than 16% because the chlorine species are adsorbed only on the InGaAs surface but the XPS sampling depth is as deep as 10 nm. Therefore, it is believed that the chlorine was almost fully  adsorbed  on  the  InGaAs  surface  at  about  10  s  and  no further  adsorption  was  observed  after  10 s  by  saturation  of chlorine on the InGaAs surface. As a reference, when chlorine gas was supplied with the condition in figure 2 without gener­ ating chlorine plasma, very little adsorption of chlorine on the InGaAs surface was observed (see supplementary information figure S1 (stacks.iop.org/JPhysD/50/254007/mmedia)).

In  figure  2,  during  the  adsorption  of  chlorine  species  on the InGaAs surface, if the energy of the chlorine ion is high enough (above the threshold), InGaAs can be etched due to the reactive sputtering of InGaAs by chlorine ions, not adsorption on the InGaAs surface. On the other hand, if the energy of the chlorine ion is too low (below the threshold), the adsorption time required for chlorine chemisorption on InGaAs surface is increased significantly because chlorine is not easily chem­ isorbed on the InGaAs surface. To investigate an optimized condition for the adsorption, the effect of the first grid voltage (acceleration grid voltage) of the ICP ion gun and the chlorine adsorption time on the InGaAs etch depth during the chlorine adsorption step was investigated and the results are shown in figures 3(a) and (b), respectively. In figure 3(a), to investigate the etch possibility of InGaAs during the adsorption step, the InGaAs was exposed for a long time of 15 min (it is related

The other conditions are the same as those in figure 2.

to  the  total  adsorption  time  of  100  cycles  for  an  optimized ALE condition) and the InGaAs etch depth was measured by varying the first grid voltage from 0 to + 30 V. As shown in figure 3(a), InGaAs was not etched until the first grid voltage was increased to + 10 V but when the first grid voltage was increased higher than + 10 V, the InGaAs was etched almost linearly with the increasing = first grid voltage. Therefore, no etching of InGaAs was expected when the first grid voltage of + 10 V was used for the adsorption step of InGaAs ALE.

However, even though no etch was observed at + 10 V in figure 3(a), if  the  exposure time is increased to longer than 15 min, the InGaAs can still be etched; therefore, the effect of chlorine adsorption time on the InGaAs etch depth for first grid voltages of + 10 V and + 15 V was also investigated and the results are shown in figure 3(b). As shown in figure 3(b), when + 10 V of first grid voltage was used, no etching was observed  until  15 min,  but  when  the  exposure  time  was increased  to + 15  V,  no  etching  was  observed  until  10  min and  the  further  increase  of  exposure  time  etched  InGaAs almost linearly. Therefore,  for  the  chlorine  exposure  condi­ tions without etching InGaAs, it is believed that chlorine is adsorbed on the surface of InGaAs as the chlorides such as InClx, GaCly, and AsClz without desorbing with the InGaAs as  etch  products.  When  the  first  grid  voltage  is  decreased, the time for the Cl saturation on the InGaAs surface is gen­ erally increased. Therefore, as an optimized chlorine adsorp­ tion condition, we used + 10 V of first grid voltage and 10 s exposure to Cl species (ion/radicals) while operating the ICP power at 200 W at Cl2 1.0 mTorr of process chamber pressure. The actual chlorine ion energy at different first grid voltages during  the  operation  of  the  ICP  ion  gun  using  Cl2  gas  was measured using a homemade retarding grid ion energy ana­ lyzer and, for + 10 V of first grid voltage, it was in the range of 10 -19 eV, which is a little higher than the first grid voltage (see supplementary information figure S2). Even though the chlorine ion energy appears to be a little high, no sputtering was  observed,  possibly  due  to  the  strong  chemical  binding energy of chlorine with InGaAs.

The chlorine adsorbed species will be chemisorbed on the surface  of  the  InGaAs,  and  the  chemisorbed  species  on  the InGaAs  surface  need  to  be  removed  during  the  desorption step by Ar + ion bombardment. Figures 4(a) and (b) show the sputter  etch  depth  of  InGaAs  itself  during  the Ar + ion  gun operation for different first grid voltages and Ar + ion exposure times, respectively. The power of the ICP ion gun for the Ar + ion was maintained at 200 W at the process chamber pressure of 3.0 mTorr Ar. The second grid voltage to the ICP ion gun was maintained at -100 V for a directional ion beam, while the third grid voltage was grounded. The sputtering was pro­ cessed in a cyclic manner, using the ALE steps in figure 1(a) for  100  cycles  without  adsorption  of  chlorine  during  the chlorine adsorption step. For figure 4(a), InGaAs was sputter etched at different first grid voltages for 50  s/cycle (therefore, a total of 5  000  s). As shown in figure 4(a), no sputtering of InGaAs was observed until 10 V of first grid voltage and the further increase of first grid voltage increased the sputter depth almost linearly. When the Ar + ion exposure time was varied, as shown in figure 4(b), sputter etching of InGaAs was observed after  100  s/cycle  (therefore,  after  the  total  exposure  time  of 10 000 s) even at + 10 V of first grid voltage. However, for the first grid voltage of + 30 V, the sputter etching was observed even at 50 s/cycles (therefore, at a total of 5  000  s). Therefore, for the desorption of chemisorbed species, + 10 V of first grid voltage and 50 s of desorption time was used as the optimized Ar + ion  desorption condition. The actual Ar + ion  energy at different first grid voltages during the operation of the Ar ICP ion gun was also measured using a homemade retarding grid ion energy analyzer and, for + 10 V of first grid voltage, it was in the range of 5 -8  eV , which is a little lower than the first grid voltage (see supplementary information figure S3).

InGaAs  was  etched  by ALE  using  the  optimized  condi­ tions of chlorine adsorption and Ar + ion desorption shown in figures 3 and 4. The results are shown in figure 5 as a func­ tion of different Ar + ion desorption time (s/cycle) during the desorption step. The etch depth was measured after the opera­ tion of 100 ALE cycles, therefore, the etch rate ( Å /cycle) was calculated by dividing the total number of etch cycles by the

The sputtering was cyclic processed for 100 cycles without adsorption of chlorine during the chlorine adsorption step. The power of the ICP ion gun for the Ar + ion was maintained at 200 W at the process chamber pressure of 3.0 mTorr Ar. The second grid voltage to the ICP ion gun was maintained at -100 V for a directional ion beam while the third grid voltage was grounded.

measurement of total etch depth. To estimate the etch selec­ tivities with other materials, mask materials such as PR and ACL and dielectric materials such as SiO2 and HfO2 were also etched together by ALE and their etch depths were also meas­ ured. As shown in figure 5, with increasing Ar + ion exposure time during the desorption step, the etch rate was increased almost  linearly  and,  when  the  Ar + ion  exposure  time  was about 50 s/cycle, the etch rate was saturated at about 1.1 Å / cycle  and  the  further  increase  in Ar + ion  exposure  time  to 100 s/cycle did not change the etch rate. For the ALE cycle, during the chlorine adsorption step, chlorine was almost satur­ ated, therefore, the increase in etch rate with the increase of Ar + ion exposure time from 0 to 50 s/cycle is related to the partial  removal  of  chemisorbed  species  on  the  InGaAs  sur­ face. When the Ar + ion exposure time was higher than 50 s/ cycle, all the InGaAs chemisorbed by chlorine was removed and fresh InGaAs  under  the chemisorbed  InGaAs  was exposed after 50 s/cycle and it was not etched by further Ar +

ion exposure time, therefore, the etch rate ( Å /cycle) was satur­ ated for 50 -100 s/cycle. In the case of other materials such as PR, ACL, Si, SiO2, and HfO2, no etching was observed even for the Ar + ion exposure time of 100 s/cycle. It is considered that the low­energy Ar + ion cannot etch InGaAs substrate and other materials such as PR, ACL, Si, SiO2, and HfO2 because the energy of an Ar + ion is lower than the sputter threshold energies  of  these  materials.  And  only  the  top  layer  of  the InGaAs surface bonded with chlorine species was removed by the Ar + ion because of the decreased binding energy between the top chlorine­adsorbed InGaAs and InGaAs under the top InGaAs. Therefore, infinite etch selectivities during the ALE of InGaAs were obtained, which is beneficial in the etching of InGaAs anisotropically and selectively.

The etch depth and etch rate ( Å /cycle) of InGaAs by the ALE condition were measured as a function of etch cycles from 100 to 400 cycles and the results are shown in figure 6. As shown in figure 6, with increasing the etch cycles up to 400 cycles, the etch depth was increased linearly, and the etch rate remained the same at ~1.1 Å /cycle, therefore, the exact InGaAs etch depth could be controlled with atomic precision by controlling the etch cycles.

The InGaAs surface characteristics such as surface rough­ ness  and  surface  composition  after  the  100  cycles  of  ALE were investigated using AFM and XPS, respectively, and the results are shown in figure 7. As references, the surface rough­ ness and surface composition of as­received InGaAs and the InGaAs etched by conventional RIE were included. For the InGaAs  RIE,  InGaAs  were  etched  for  1 min  using  an  ICP etcher operated at 13.56 MHz 200 W, -50 V of bias voltage, and Cl2 gas pressure of 10 mTorr. As shown in figure 7, the surface roughness of the InGaAs etched by ALE was similar to that of as­received InGaAs, while for InGaAs etched by the RIE, the increase in surface roughness was observed. Also, in the case of surface composition, the composition ratio of In:Ga:As of the InGaAs etched by ALE was similar to that of as­received InGaAs. However, the InGaAs etched by RIE showed an In­rich surface,  possibly  due  to  the  lower  vapor pressure  of  indium  chlorides  compared  to  other  chlorides.

Also, for the InGaAs etched by RIE, chlorine remained on the surface as the etch residue while no such residue was observed for the InGaAs etched by ALE. The increase in surface rough­ ness of InGaAs etched by RIE compared to the InGaA etched by ALE could be related to the formation of an In­rich modi­ fied layer formed on the etched InGaAs surface while no such modified layer was observed for the InGaAs etched by ALE. Therefore,  the  results  showed  that,  by  using  the ALE  tech­ nique, InGaAs can be etched selectively and with significantly lower surface damage and contamination compared to con­ ventional RIE, and it could be an essential etch method for subnanometer­scale device technologies.

## 4.  Conclusion

In this study, ALE characteristics of InGaAs by a controlled ion  beam  technique  were  investigated.  As  the  adsorption of  chlorine  on  InGaAs  surface,  low­energy  chlorine  ions/ radicals were used, and as the desorption of the InGaAs sur­ face  atoms  chemisorbed  by  chlorine,  low  energy  Ar + ion beam  was  used.  The  results  showed  that,  by  using  a  low energy chlorine ion (10~19 eV at + 10 V of 1st grid voltage)/ radical for 10 sec, InGaAs surface was effectively adsorbed and  covered  with  chlorine  and,  by  using  a  low  energy Ar + ion beam (5~8 eV at + 10 V of 1 st grid voltage) for 50 sec, the  InGaAs  chemisorbed  by  chlorine  could  be  effectively removed from the surface without sputtering InGaAs. Using the ALE method, a saturated InGaAs etch rate of about 1.1 Å/ cycle could be obtained and the etch rate was remained con­ stant regardless the etch cycles up to 400 cycles, therefore, the InGaAs etch depth could be controlled precisely with atomic precision by controlling etch cycles in addition to the infinite etch selectivities over other materials such as mask materials and dielectrics. No significant changes in surface roughness and composition of etched InGaAs surface were also observed after the 100 cycles of ALE. Therefore, it is believed that the ALE method used for InGaAs etching can be applied as an essential etch method for next generation subnanometer scale device technologies.
