ABSTRACT: Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of amorphous and crystalline aluminum nitride was performed using sequential exposures of hydrogen /uniFB02 uoride (HF) or xenon di /uniFB02 uoride (XeF2) as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant and boron trichloride (BCl ) as 3 the ligand-exchange reactant. The expected /uniFB02 uorination reactions are AlN + 3HF(g) → AlF3 + NH3(g) and AlN + 1.5XeF2 → AlF3 + NF3(g) + 1.5 Xe(g). The expected complete ligand-exchange reaction is AlF 3 + BCl3(g) → BF3(g) + AlCl3(g). The HF /uniFB02 uorination reactant together with BCl3 could etch amorphous AlN /uniFB01 lms deposited using AlN atomic layer deposition (ALD). The XeF2 /uniFB02 uorination reactant together with BCl3 was required to etch crystalline AlN. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)

spectroscopy was utilized to study the growth of AlN ALD using tris(dimethylamido)aluminum and ammonia as the reactants. Thermal AlN ALE of the AlN ALD /uniFB01 lms with HF and BCl3 as the reactants was then monitored using FTIR spectroscopy. The etching of the AlN ALD /uniFB01 lms occurred at temperatures greater than 200 ° C. The change of the spectral features versus HF and BCl 3 exposures was consistent with a ligand-exchange etching mechanism for AlN thermal ALE. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to measure the thermal ALE of crystalline AlN using XeF 2 and static exposures of BCl . The crystalline AlN displayed etch 3 rates that varied with temperature from 0.19 Å/cycle at 212 ° C to 0.93 Å/cycle at 298 ° C. The etch rates were dependent on both the static BCl3 exposure and the XeF2 exposure. Consistent etch rates could be obtained by controlling the time or number of reactant exposures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were consistent with aluminum /uniFB02 uoride (AlF3) being formed during the XeF2 exposure and subsequently removed after the BCl 3 exposure. Quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) was also used to identify the volatile etch products during the reaction of BCl 3 with AlF3. These QMS investigations observed AlCl3 as the etch product and BCl F x y ligand-exchange products. The temperature dependence of the AlCl 3 etch products and BCl F x y ligand-exchange products revealed that the ligand-exchange products appeared at temperatures below the onset of the AlCl 3 etch products at 200 ° C. H2O was also utilized together with XeF 2 and BCl3 to attempt to remove Cl and F from the AlN surface either during or after AlN ALE. XPS studies revealed that a /uniFB01 nal large H O exposure after AlN ALE was most e 2 /uniFB00 ective at Cl and F removal.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a technique used to remove material with atomic layer control. 1,2 ALE is performed using sequential, self-limiting reactions that involve initial surface modi cation and then volatile release of the modi /uniFB01 /uniFB01 ed surface layer. During plasma ALE, energetic ions or neutral atoms release the modi ed /uniFB01 surface layer by a sputtering process. 2 During thermal ALE, chemical reactions between an incoming precursor and the modi /uniFB01 ed surface layer lead to the volatilization of the surface layer. 3 Plasma and thermal ALE are both needed for the fabrication of three-dimensional nanostructures. 4 The directional properties of energetic ions or neutrals in plasma ALE can obtain anisotropic etching. 2 The ability of molecules to go anywhere enables thermal ALE to obtain isotropic etching needed for lateral and recess etching. 5,6

Many materials have been etched using thermal ALE over the past several years. 1 Using the /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-

reactants are still needed to develop ALE processes for many other materials.

New reactants are also required to obtain selective ALE between various materials. 20 Selective etching aims to remove one material in the presence of other materials. There are examples of selective etching for the thermal ALE for some materials such as Al2 O3, ZrO2, and TiN. 17,20,21 For full /uniFB02 exibility in fabrication, the goal is to have one set of reactants to etch material A, but not material B. In addition, another set of reactants is required to etch material B, but not material A. This objective is sometimes termed the ' multiple color challenge . ' 4 The goals of area selective etching (ASE) are similar to the objectives of area selective deposition (ASD). 22 Both ASE and ASD would like to achieve either etching or deposition based on the initial material.

Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a III -V wide bandgap semiconductor material with high thermal conductivity. 23 AlN is an important platform for high power transistors and high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). 24 AlN is also piezoelectric and has key uses for microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors. 25,26 Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes can be fabricated using AlN nanowires. 27 Other application areas for AlN include integrated photonics 28 and spintronics. 29 The processing needed to fabricate AlN devices requires AlN etching. Etching of AlN has been accomplished with both wet and dry plasma-based techniques. 30 -32 These etching processes result in continuous AlN etching that is not controlled at the atomic level.

AlN thermal ALE will be needed for atomic layer control of AlN etching. In addition, selective thermal ALE is required for etching of AlN in the presence of other materials. An earlier study reported AlN thermal ALE using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand exchange where HF was used for /uniFB02 uorination and Sn(acac)2 was employed for ligand exchange. 11 In contrast, this work focused on AlN thermal ALE using either HF or XeF2 for /uniFB02 uorination and BCl3 for ligand exchange. Using di /uniFB00 erent ligand-exchange precursors, such as Sn(acac)2 or BCl3, may enable pathways for selective AlN thermal ALE. This study examined the etch rates, etch mechanism, and volatile etch products for AlN thermal ALE using HF or XeF2 for /uniFB02 uorination and BCl3 for ligand exchange. A variety of di /uniFB00 erent techniques were employed including spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS).

## II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

FTIR Spectroscopy. FTIR experiments were performed in a hot-walled, viscous /uniFB02 ow reactor. A full description of this reactor has been presented previously. 33 The reactor tube is heated by a ceramic heater (Watlow). The heater was controlled by a PID controller. To obtain a high surface area sample for transmission FTIR experiments, Si nanoparticles (US-Nano Research Materials) were pressed into a 3 cm by 1.5 cm tungsten grid with a thickness of 50 μ m and 100 gridlines/ in. 16 The silicon particles had an average diameter of 30 -50 nm. The grid was resistively heated by a Hewlett-Packard 6268B power supply. A current of ∼ 20 A was required to obtain a substrate temperature of 400 ° C. The substrate temperature was monitored by a Type K thermocouple that was adhered to the grid with a nonconductive epoxy (Ceramabond, Aremco 571).

AlN ALD was accomplished in the FTIR reactor using tris(dimethylamido)aluminum (TDMAA, Strem Chemicals) and ammonia (99.9%, Airgas). TDMAA was heated to 85 -100 ° C for su /uniFB03 cient vapor pressure. The TDMAA was delivered by /uniFB02 owing N2 gas at ∼ 20 -50 sccm over the headspace of the TDMAA and then into the FTIR reactor. To obtain the highest ammonia purity, a purifying unit (Matheson) was used to remove water from the ammonia prior to introduction to the FTIR reactor. BCl3 (99%, Synquest Chemicals) and HFpyridine (70% HF, 30% pyridine, Millipore-Sigma) were used for AlN etching in the FTIR reactor. The HF-pyridine was loaded into a gold-plated stainless steel bubbler to minimize corrosion. During the HF and BCl3 exposures, N2 gas at a /uniFB02 ow rate of 100 sccm was passed through the FTIR reactor. This N 2 /uniFB02 ow established a background pressure of 1.0 Torr in the reactor.

FTIR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 6700 or an iS50R ThermoFisher FTIR spectrometer. The light was generated and split by a KBr beam splitter. The light was directed into the reactor, transmitted through the tungsten grid, and then traveled back out of the reactor to an MCT-B detector. The infrared light passed through two KBr windows that were separated from the reactor by gate valves. The gate valves were closed during the reactant exposures and opened while obtaining the FTIR spectra. Spectra were averaged for 100 scans with a resolution of 4 cm -1 . Background spectra were collected prior to conducting each experiment.

Spectroscopic Ellipsometry and Atomic Force Microscopy. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) experiments were performed in a home-built warm-walled reactor that has been described previously. 15 A resistive heater elevated the sample temperature up to a temperature limit of ∼ 370 ° C. A spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000, J. A. Woollam) was used for all ellipsometry experiments. Wavelengths from 240 to 1700 nm were used in the /uniFB01 tting of the /uniFB01 lm optical properties. The polarized light intersected the sample surface at a 70 ° angle from normal and was /uniFB01 xed at this angle. The Ψ and Δ parameters were analyzed with the CompleteEASE software package (J. A. Woollam).

Single-crystal aluminum nitride wafers were obtained from Kyma Technologies. The thickness of the AlN /uniFB01 lm on sapphire ranged from 300 to 400 nm. An ordinary sapphire model was used to model the sapphire substrate. The AlN layer was /uniFB01 t using an extended Cauchy model with Urbach coe /uniFB03 cients. The model /uniFB01 tting yielded an index of refraction of ≈ 2.5. This index of refraction was higher than previously reported values regardless of chosen model. 34,35 The ellipsometry model included surface roughness. The surface roughness has some correlation with a possible top layer such as the native oxide on the AlN /uniFB01 lm. Mean-squared errors (MSE) for the ellipsometry model /uniFB01 ts were consistently below 10.

BCl3, HF-pyridine, and XeF2 (99.5%, Strem Chemicals) were employed for AlN etching in the reactor equipped for in situ ellipsometry. During the BCl3, HF, and XeF2 exposures conducted in viscous /uniFB02 ow, N2 gas at a /uniFB02 ow rate of 200 sccm was passed through the reactor. This N2 /uniFB02 ow established a background pressure of 2.0 Torr. The BCl3, HF, and XeF2 pressures were measured on top of this 2.0 Torr base pressure. In addition, static BCl3 exposures were also utilized for AlN etching without the N2 background pressure.

Static BCl 3 exposures in the in situ ellipsometry reactor were performed using the following procedure. First, the valve connecting the N2 carrier gas to the reactor body was closed,

https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c10972

J. Phys. Chem. C 2022, 126, 6990 - 6999

and the chamber was pumped out fully. Subsequently, the valve to the vacuum pump was closed, and BCl3 was /uniFB02 owed into the reactor. After the pressure set point was reached, the valve to the BCl3 precursor was closed, and the BCl3 was allowed to react with the substrate for the exposure time. After the exposure time was reached, the valve to the pump was reopened before reopening the valve to the N 2 carrier gas.

The surface topography was also monitored before and after etching. These atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements determined if etching leads to surface smoothing or an increase in surface roughness. The AFM analysis was conducted using a Park NX10 AFM instrument in noncontact mode.

Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry. Detection of the volatile etch products using quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) was performed in a new reactor described previously. 36 The volatile etch products were entrained in a molecular beam that was formed by expansion from an aperture, traveled through a di /uniFB00 erentially pumped region, passed through a skimmer, and then was detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Extrel, MAX-QMS Flanged Mounted System). An electron ionization energy of 70 eV was used for these experiments. To minimize exposures to corrosive gaseous species, the ionizer and analyzer were positioned perpendicular to the incoming molecular beam. AlF3 powder was purchased from US-Nano Research Materials (99.5%).

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5600, RBD Instruments) measured the composition of the AlN /uniFB01 lms. A monochromatic Al K α Xray source (1486.6 eV) was used to collect survey scans with a pass energy of 93.9 eV and step size of 0.400 eV. Casa XPS software (Casa XPS, Casa Software) determined the surface concentrations using the peak areas for the C 1s, O 1s, Al 2p, N 1s, F 1s, and B 2p XPS signals and the corresponding sensitivity factors. All peaks were calibrated to the C 1s peak for adventitious carbon centered at 284.8 eV.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

FTIR Spectroscopy of AlN ALD and AlN ALE. AlN ALD was monitored using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectra during AlN ALD after every 40 cycles

during sequential TDMAA and NH3 exposures at 400 ° C. There is a clear absorbance increase at 645 cm -1 after 40 cycles of TDMAA and NH3. This absorbance peak is consistent with the Al -N stretching vibration. 37 -39 There is also an absorbance peak at 1150 cm -1 in Figure 1 that is assigned to the Si -O stretching vibration. 40 This absorbance peak appears primarily during the /uniFB01 rst 40 cycles and results from changes to the SiO2 layer on the underlying silicon nanoparticles that are used as a support for the AlN ALD /uniFB01 lm.

The width of the absorption peak for the Al -N stretching vibration peak was 315 cm -1 . This broad width could result from an amorphous or polycrystalline AlN /uniFB01 lm. 38 There could also be some broadening resulting from the Al -O stretching vibration on the high frequency side of the absorption peak from 600 to 900 cm -1 41 . This blue-shifted shoulder is more prominent early during the AlN ALD growth. The contribution from Al -O stretching vibrations is negligible during the later stages of the AlN ALD growth. The source of the oxygen could be the original SiO2 native oxide on the silicon nanoparticles used as a support or a small H O impurity 2 in the chamber during the early stages of the AlN ALD growth.

FTIR spectra were recorded after each half-cycle during sequential exposures of HF and BCl 3 at 350 ° C to monitor the AlN thermal ALE. The HF pressure was 100 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. The BCl 3 pressure was 500 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. Figure 2 displays the di /uniFB00 erence spectra

relative to the initial absorption spectrum for the AlN ALD /uniFB01 lm. The peak of the absorbance loss is centered at 650 cm -1 . This peak absorbance loss is very close to the peak of the absorbance gain during AlN ALD observed in Figure 1 at 645 cm -1 . The slight shift in frequency is attributed to the absorbance from some Al -F stretching vibrations on the etched surface. Figure 2 shows that there is a nearly linear decrease in the absorbance as a function of HF and BCl3 cycles. There is also a small increase in absorbance around 1240 cm -1 . This slight increase could be caused by some BN formation as a result of AlN conversion to BN by BCl3. 13

FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectra are useful to isolate the changes occurring during each reactant exposure. Figure 3 displays the FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectra during the 10th cycle of AlN ALE at 350 ° C. Figure 3a shows the FTIR spectrum after the HF exposure referenced to the FTIR spectrum after the previous BCl3 exposure. Figure 3b shows the FTIR spectrum after the

next BCl3 exposure referenced to the FTIR spectrum after the previous HF exposure.

The FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectrum in Figure 3a after the HF exposure is complicated by the overlap of the Al -N and Al -F vibrational features. 37,42,43 The HF exposure converts AlN to AlF3 by the reaction AlN + 3HF(g) → AlF3 + NH3(g). The absorbance loss of the Al -N stretching vibration and the absorbance gain of the Al -F stretching vibration are nearly coincident. There is not an obvious absorbance loss at ∼ 645 cm -1 in Figure 3a resulting from HF /uniFB02 uorination of AlN. In contrast, the absorbance loss from the removal of the Al -F stretching vibration is much more obvious in Figure 3b. The BCl3 exposure removes AlF3 by the ligand-exchange reaction AlF3 + BCl3(g) → AlCl3(g) + BF3(g).

The di /uniFB00 erence spectra in Figure 3 also show evidence for some conversion of AlN to BN resulting from the BCl3 exposure by the reaction AlN + BCl3(g) → BN + AlCl3(g). 12,13,15 The absorbance for the B -N stretching vibration occurs at 1200 -1450 cm -1 44 . The absorbance in this region increases in Figure 3b during the BCl3 exposure. The converted BN is then removed during the HF exposure by the reaction BN + HF(g) → BF3(g) + NF3(g). The absorbance in the region from 1200 to 1450 cm -1 decreases in Figure 3a during the HF exposure.

The temperature dependence of AlN ALE was also investigated by measuring the change of absorbance of the Al -N stretching vibration per AlN ALE cycle. Figure 4 shows the change in the integrated absorbance for the Al -N stretching vibration per cycle from 400 to 1000 cm -1 at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures from 200 to 350 ° C. There was negligible AlN etching observed at 200 ° C. Larger absorbance changes and higher etching rates were observed at higher temperatures.

Spectroscopic Ellipsometry and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of AlN ALE. AlN ALD yields amorphous or polycrystalline AlN /uniFB01 lms. The thermal ALE of these AlN ALD /uniFB01 lms could be di /uniFB00 erent than the thermal ALE of single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lms. 45,46 Single-crystalline materials may be harder to /uniFB02 uorinate than their amorphous or polycrystalline counterparts. 45,46 Figure 5 shows the XRD pattern for the singlecrystal AlN sample on an underlying crystalline sapphire Al O 2 3

substrate that was used in these experiments. The thickness of the single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lm was 300 nm. A prominent peak is observed for AlN(002) at 2 Θ = 36.0 . A smaller peak is also ° detected for AlN(101) at 2 Θ = 38.1 . In addition, the XRD ° pattern detects a peak for Al O (0001) at 2 2 3 Θ = 41.7 . °

The etching of the single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lm was /uniFB01 rst attempted using alternating exposures of HF and BCl 3 at 298 ° C. Figure 6 shows the AlN thickness after each half-cycle during 30 cycles of HF and BCl3 reactant exposures measured using in situ SE analysis. The BCl3 exposure was in viscous /uniFB02 ow in Figure 6a and in static exposure in Figure 6b. During the viscous /uniFB02 ow BCl3 exposures, the BCl3 pressure was 500 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. During the static BCl3 exposures, the

BCl3 pressure was 2.5 Torr for an exposure time of 20 s. The HF pressure was 100 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s.

There is no evidence of any single-crystal AlN etching using HF together with BCl3 exposures in viscous /uniFB02 ow in Figure 6a. There is also no evidence of single-crystal AlN etching using HF together with the static BCl 3 exposures in Figure 6b. The single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lm clearly does not etch as readily as the AlN ALD /uniFB01 lm. The etching of single-crystal AlN may require a stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactant. A similar situation was encountered during thermal ALE of single-crystal GaN /uniFB01 lms. 11 HF and BCl3 as the reactants were not su /uniFB03 cient to etch single-crystal GaN. In contrast, the stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactant, xenon di /uniFB02 uoride (XeF2), led to thermal GaN ALE together with BCl3 as the reactants. 11

The thermochemistry of /uniFB02 uorination is much more favorable with XeF2 compared with HF. The standard free energy changes for the /uniFB02 uorination of AlN with HF and XeF2 are 47

$$\text{AlN} + 3 H F ( g ) & \to \text{AlF} _ { 3 } + \text{NH} _ { 3 } ( g ) \\ \Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 9 8 \, ^ { \circ } C ) & = - 6 1. 5 \, \text{kcal} \\ \text{AlN} + 3 X e F _ { 2 } ( g ) & \to \text{AlF} _ { 3 } + \text{NF} _ { 3 } ( g ) + 3 X e ( g ) \\ \cdot \, \cdot \, \cdot \, \cdot \, \cdot \, \cdot \, \cdot$$

$$\Delta G ^ { \circ } ( 2 9 8 \, ^ { \circ } C ) = - 2 4 4. 9 \, k c a l$$

Given the lack of single-crystal AlN etching using HF, XeF2 was explored as a stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactant together with BCl3 for ligand exchange.

The etching of the single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lm was initially performed with XeF2 and BCl3 in viscous /uniFB02 ow at 298 ° C. The XeF2 pressure was 50 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. The BCl3 pressure was 500 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. Figure 7a shows that the AlN thickness is not reduced under these reaction conditions. The BCl3 reactant exposure was then performed using static exposures. For these AlN etching experiments with static BCl 3 exposures, the XeF2 was pulsed into the reactor at a pressure of 50 mTorr for 1 s. The reactor was then purged for 40 s before recording an SE measurement. For the BCl3 exposure, BCl3 was introduced into the reactor until the BCl3 pressure reached ∼ 2 Torr. Then the BCl3 pressure was held statically for ∼ 20 s. Subsequently, the BCl 3

was pumped out and the reactor was purged with N2 for 60 s before recording an SE measurement.

The single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lm could be etched under these static exposure conditions for BCl . Figure 7b displays the AlN 3 thickness versus number of XeF2/BCl3 cycles at 255 ° C using the static BCl 3 exposures. The AlN thickness decreases linearly as a function of XeF /BCl 2 3 cycles for over 300 cycles. The AlN etch rate was 0.62 Å/cycle. The optical thickness for the AlN /uniFB01 lm decreased 0.32 Å/cycle during the XeF2 exposure. The optical thickness for the AlN /uniFB01 lm also decreased 0.30 Å/cycle during the BCl3 exposure. These decreases in the optical thickness are dependent on the surface species on the AlN surface in addition to the actual change in the AlN /uniFB01 lm thickness.

Static BCl3 exposures were required for AlN ALE. These static BCl 3 exposures deliver high BCl 3 exposures of 40 Torr s. In comparison, the viscous /uniFB02 ow BCl3 exposures provide much smaller BCl3 exposures of 0.5 Torr s. The higher static BCl 3 exposures may be required for the ligand-exchange reaction to remove the /uniFB02 uorinated AlF3 surface layer. In addition, these higher static BCl3 exposures could be needed to convert the AlN surface to BN prior to the spontaneous etching of the BN surface layer by HF.

AFM measurements were also recorded before and after etching using XeF2/BCl3 cycles at 255 ° C. These AFM measurements revealed that AlN ALE did not change the surface roughness or slightly reduced the surface roughness. For each AFM measurement, the roughness was an average of /uniFB01 ve separate AFM scans in three di /uniFB00 erent locations across the coupon. Because the initial RMS surface roughness varied between 0.7 and 2.9 nm for the di /uniFB00 erent initial samples, the change in the RMS surface roughness was measured versus number of AlN ALE cycles. The change in the RMS surface roughness was -0.1, -0.16, 0.9, and -0.9 nm after 10, 20, 50, and 100 AlN ALE cycles, respectively.

The temperature-dependent etching of the single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lm using XeF2 and BCl3 is shown in Figure 8. These experiments utilized the same static BCl 3 reaction conditions as described above for the AlN etching in Figure 7b. The XeF 2 exposure was at a pressure of 50 mTorr for 1 s, and the static BCl3 exposure was at a pressure of 2 Torr for 20 s. A

measurable AlN etch rate of 0.19 Å/cycle was observed at 212 ° C. The AlN etch rate then increased at higher temperatures. The AlN etch rates were 0.56, 0.58, 0.68, 0.73, and 0.93 Å/ cycle at 230, 255, 263, 280, and 298 ° C, respectively. The temperature dependence of the AlN etch rates is attributed to the temperature dependence of the /uniFB02 uorination and ligandexchange reactions. The etch rates at 255 ° C in Figures 7b and 8 are slightly di /uniFB00 erent because they were measured at di /uniFB00 erent times.

The AlN etch rates from the various temperatures in Figure 8 are less than 1 Å/cycle and all signi /uniFB01 cantly less than the unit cell lengths of crystalline AlN. The structure of crystalline AlN is wurtzite. The lattice constants of crystalline AlN are a = 3.11 Å and c = 4.98 Å. The AlN etch rate of 0.73 Å/cycle at 280 ° C using XeF2 and BCl3 exposures in Figure 8 is slightly higher than the AlN etch rate of 0.36 Å/cycle from previous measurements at 275 ° C using HF and Sn(acac)2 exposures. 11 These earlier measurements employed static exposures of 1270 mTorr s for HF and 900 mTorr s for Sn(acac)2. In addition, the single-crystal AlN samples used in the previous measurements were AlN /uniFB01 lms epitaxially grown on Si(111) wafers by Kyma Technologies. 11 There may have been di /uniFB00 erences in the quality of crystalline AlN /uniFB01 lms grown on Si(111) wafers in the previous investigation and sapphire substrates in this study.

The AlN thickness reduction in Figure 8 is linear at each temperature under the given reaction conditions. However, the individual XeF 2 and BCl3 reactions were not self-limiting. Etch rates were measured for larger XeF 2 and BCl3 exposures at 298 ° C. For an AlN ALE cycle composed of 6 consecutive XeF2 exposures at 50 mTorr for 1 s followed by 23 consecutive BCl 3 static exposures at 2 Torr for 20 s, the AlN etch rate was 1.3 Å/ cycle. This etch rate is larger than the etch rate of 0.93 Å/cycle at 298 ° C measured in Figure 8. These results indicate that the AlN etch rate can be controlled by the XeF2 and BCl3 exposures. Etch rates higher than 0.93 Å/cycle are possible at 298 ° C with higher XeF2 and BCl3 exposures.

Figure 9 shows the dependence of the AlN etch rate on the BCl3 exposure at 255 ° C. The BCl3 exposure was varied from 0

to 130 Torr s. The XeF2 exposure was 1 s at 50 mTorr. The AlN etch rate was 0.41 Å per XeF2/BCl3 cycle at a BCl3 exposure of 4 Torr s. The AlN etch rate nearly doubled to 0.81 Å per XeF2/BCl3 cycle at a BCl 3 exposure of 125 Torr s. The dependence of the AlN etch rate on the BCl 3 exposure was not self-limiting. This dependence on the BCl3 exposure is attributed to di /uniFB03 culty removing the /uniFB02 uorinated AlN surface layer and some additional conversion of AlN to BN at larger BCl3 exposures that increases the AlN etch rate. However, very constant etch rates were obtained under constant reaction conditions.

The chemical state of Al on the AlN surface during AlN ALE with XeF2 and BCl3 was examined using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For these experiments, the AlN /uniFB01 lm was etched using 50 XeF2/BCl3 cycles. The XeF2 pressure was 50 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. The BCl3 pressure was 500 mTorr for an exposure time of 1 s. Figure 10 then shows the XPS Al 2p peak after the etching was

concluded with either the XeF2 or BCl3 exposure. Figure 10a displays the results after the XeF 2 exposure. Figure 10b displays the results after the BCl 3 exposure.

Figure 10a shows multiple peaks in the Al 2p region after the XeF2 exposure. The Al 2p XPS peak in AlN is centered at 73.6 eV, and the Al 2p XPS peak in Al2 O3 is centered at 74.7 eV. 48 -50 In comparison, the Al 2p XPS peak in aluminum /uniFB02 uoride is centered somewhere from 76 to 77.5 eV. 42,48,49 The experimentally observed XPS spectrum was /uniFB01 t assuming binding energies and line widths de /uniFB01 ned by the AlN, Al2O3 and AlF3 Al 2p XPS peaks. The /uniFB01 t was consistent with the individual peaks shown in Figure 10a containing all three components. The Al 2p XPS peak consistent with Al2 O3 is attributed to air exposure of the sample during transfer from the etching chamber to the XPS analysis tool. Another small peak located at 78.2 eV most likely results from copper contamination that yields a Cu 3p XPS peak. 51

Figure 10b shows the XPS spectrum in the Al 2p region for the AlN sample after the BCl3 exposure. In contrast to Figure 10a, there is only a single peak that is consistent with AlN. This XPS spectrum argues that only AlN remains after the BCl3 exposures. The AlF3 component of the surface layer in Figure 10a is not observed after the BCl 3 exposure. This removal of AlF3 is attributed to ligand-exchange reactions between BCl3 and AlF3.

Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry of BCl3 Exposures on AlF3. The volatile products from the exposure of BCl 3 to AlF3 were studied by quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) to understand the ligand-exchange reaction during thermal AlN ALE. Figure 11a displays the mass spectrum recorded when

BCl3 is exposed to AlF3 powder at 295 ° C. The volatile products are the result of the ligand-exchange reactions and the etching of AlF . Single ligand exchange where BCl 3 3 exchanges a single Cl with a single F from the AlF 3 surface results in BCl F 2 with a cluster of ion signals at m z / = 97 -102. The cluster of ion intensities results from the two main isotopes of boron (20% 10 B, 80% 11 B) and the two main isotopes of chlorine (76% 35 Cl, 24% 37 Cl). Double and complete ligand exchange are also observed by the products BClF 2 and BF3, respectively, which are observed with a cluster of ion signals around m z / = 83 and m z / = 65. The cluster around m z / = 65 includes the BF3 + and BClF + peaks.

In addition to the BCl F x y ligand-exchange products, the AlCl3 etch product from the AlF3 surface is also observed in Figure 11a between m z / = 132 and 138. Observing AlCl3 at 295 ° C is expected because AlCl 3 has a vapor pressure of ≈ 1 Torr at 100 ° C and exceeds ≈ 760 Torr at &gt;180 ° C. 52 Figure 11b shows an expansion of the m z / range from m z / = 130 to 139. The red bars indicate the expected ion signals resulting from the isotopic abundance of Cl and Al. The peak at m z / = 132 is the peak with 100% relative abundance. The intensities for the other ion signals are 97.2%, 31.5%, and 3.4% for m z / = 134, 136, and 138, respectively. There is excellent agreement between the ion intensities and the expectations from the natural isotopic abundances. This agreement con /uniFB01 rms the assignment of this ion cluster to AlCl . 3

The temperature dependence of the reaction of BCl3 with AlF3 was also explored using a heating rate of 3 ° C/min. Figure 12a displays the BF Cl x y ligand-exchange products. Figure 12b

shows the AlCl x etch products. There is some ligand exchange at temperatures less than the onset temperature of 200 ° C for the AlCl3 etch product. This ligand exchange leads to F/Cl transfer and the buildup of Cl in the AlF3 powder. At temperatures &gt;200 ° C, Figure 12a reveals that the BCl3 + reactant intensity progressively drops and the BCl2F + and BClF2 + and BF3 + ion intensities increase. Figure 12b shows that the ion intensities for AlCl3 + and AlCl2 + also display a concurrent increase at temperatures &gt;200 ° C. The ligandexchange reactions are producing ligand-exchange products, and the F/Cl transfer is converting AlF 3 to volatile AlCl . 3

The temperature threshold of 200 ° C for the onset of AlCl 3 etch products from ligand exchange of BCl 3 with AlF3 is also in good agreement with the temperature threshold for AlN ALE. Figure 4 reveals that the FTIR studies on AlN ALD /uniFB01 lms observed a threshold for AlN ALE at ∼ 200 ° C. Figure 8 demonstrates that measurable AlN ALE etch rates for the

single-crystal AlN /uniFB01 lms were obtained by the ellipsometry studies for temperatures &gt;200 ° C.

At temperatures &gt;300 -350 ° C, the BCl2F + and BClF2 + ion intensities decrease and the BF3 + ion intensity becomes the main ligand-exchange product. BF3 is derived from three ligand-exchange reactions between BCl3 and the AlF3 substrate. The higher temperatures are favoring BCl2F to undergo a second ligand exchange with AlF3 to form BClF2. Subsequently, BClF2 undergoes a third ligand exchange with AlF3 to form BF3. The production of the AlCl3 etch product also continues to increase at these higher temperatures.

These QMS etching measurements avoided HF exposures by using AlF3 powder. As a result, the BCl 3 exposure did not encounter /uniFB02 uorinated metal surfaces that could have undergone F/Cl ligand exchange with BCl3. The appearance of the BCl F x y products in Figure 12a is attributed only to ligand exchange with the AlF3 powder.

X-ray Photoelectron Studies of E /uniFB00 ect of H2O on Surface Species. The AlN surface was examined after AlN ALE using ex situ XPS. These studies revealed that there were chlorine and /uniFB02 uorine species on the surface that varied between 5 and 10 at. %. H O exposures were added to the AlN 2 ALE process sequence in an attempt to remove these surface species. A similar strategy was employed recently to reduce the /uniFB02 uorine on Al O3 2 after thermal Al O 2 3 ALE using Al(CH3)3 and HF as the reactants. 53 Figure 13 shows the AlN thickness as a

function of XeF /BCl3 2 /H2O cycles at 255 ° C. The cycle starts with a XeF2 exposure of 50 mTorr for 1 s followed by a BCl 3 static exposure at 2.5 Torr for 20 s. The cycle ends with a H O 2 exposure at 80 mTorr for 1 s. The linear reduction of the AlN thickness in Figure 13 yields an etch rate of 0.49 Å/cycle for the XeF2/BCl3/H2O process. This etch rate is slightly less than the etch rate of 0.62 Å/cycle observed for the XeF2/BCl3 process under similar reaction conditions at 255 ° C.

Additional ex situ XPS studies were performed to quantify the Cl and F species on the AlN surface following di /uniFB00 erent reaction conditions. XPS spectra were recorded after 50 cycles of XeF2/BCl3 ending with BCl3, after 50 cycles of XeF /BCl / 2 3 H2O ending with H2O, and after 50 cycles of XeF2/BCl3

ending with one H2O exposure at 80 mTorr for 5 s. The atomic percentages of Al, N, O, F, and Cl are plotted in Figure 14 for these three di /uniFB00 erent reaction conditions. In addition, a

survey XPS spectrum is also included for the AlN sample prior to any etching. For clarity, the adventitious carbon was removed from the reported atomic percentages.

After 50 cycles of XeF /BCl 2 3 ending with BCl3, the Cl at. % was 10.5% and the F at. % was 6%. Adding H2O to the AlN ALE processing sequence slightly reduced the F at. % but not the Cl at. %. After 50 cycles of XeF /BCl /H2 2 3 O ending with H2O, the Cl at. % was 11% and the F at. % was 4%. The /uniFB01 nal H2O exposure displayed the largest reduction in the halogen contamination. After 50 cycles of XeF /BCl 2 3 ending with one H2O exposure at 80 mTorr for 5 s, the Cl at. % was 0.6% and F at. % was 3.4%. These results illustrate that H O can e 2 /uniFB00 ectively remove some Cl and F from the AlN surface resulting from AlN ALE. The most e /uniFB00 ective reduction was obtained by exposing the AlN surface to H2O exposure after AlN ALE.

Figure 14 reveals that there are also changes in the O at. % depending on the reaction conditions. For the AlN sample prior to etching, the O at. % was 27.1%. After 50 cycles of XeF2/BCl3 ending with BCl3, the O at. % was the lowest at 6.5%. After 50 cycles of XeF /BCl /H O ending with H2O, the 2 3 2 O at. % was comparable to the initial AlN sample at 25.1%. After 50 cycles of XeF /BCl 2 3 ending with one H2O exposure for 5 s, the O at. % was 13.4%. The optimum H O exposure for 2 reducing Cl and F contaminants and minimizing the AlN oxidation is the one longer H O exposure after the AlN ALE 2 process.

## IV. CONCLUSIONS

AlN thermal ALE was performed using HF or XeF2 as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant and BCl 3 as the ligand-exchange reactant. HF together with BCl3 was successful for etching amorphous AlN. Crystalline AlN required XeF2 together with BCl3 . FTIR spectroscopy was used to study the thermal ALE of amorphous AlN ALD /uniFB01 lms. Sequential HF and BCl3 exposures were able

to etch the AlN ALD /uniFB01 lms at temperatures &gt;200 ° C. The FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectra supported a ligand-exchange mechanism where BCl3 removes the AlF3 layer on AlN after HF /uniFB02 uorination. BCl 3 also led to a small amount of conversion of AlN to BN. This BN conversion layer was then removed by HF exposures.

The thermal ALE of crystalline AlN /uniFB01 lms was investigated using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. These experiments employed XeF2 for /uniFB02 uorination and static exposures of BCl 3 for ligand exchange. The sequential XeF 2 and BCl3 exposures led to the linear loss of the AlN /uniFB01 lm thickness. The etch rates for crystalline AlN increased with temperature. For a constant set of XeF2 and BCl3 exposures, the measured etch rates were 0.19, 0.56, 0.58, 0.68, 0.73, and 0.93 Å/cycle at 213, 230, 255, 263, 280, and 298 ° C, respectively. However, the AlN etch rates were dependent on the XeF2 exposure and the static BCl 3 exposure. The AlN etch rates could be tuned by varying the XeF2 or BCl3 exposures.

XPS studies con /uniFB01 rmed that AlF3 was formed by the XeF2 exposure and then removed by the BCl3 exposure. The volatile etch products during the reaction of BCl 3 with AlF3 were also identi /uniFB01 ed using quadrupole mass spectrometry. AlCl3 was observed as the etch product. A variety of BCl F x y ligandexchange products were also detected at temperatures below and above the onset of the AlCl 3 etch products at 200 ° C. XPS measurements also detected Cl and F on the AlN surface after AlN ALE. These halogen species could be slightly reduced by including H2O in the reaction sequence together with XeF2 and BCl3. The most e /uniFB00 ective procedure to reduce Cl and F was a large H O exposure after the AlN ALE. 2
