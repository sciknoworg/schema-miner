ABSTRACT: The thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of TiN was demonstrated using a new etching mechanism based on sequential, selflimiting oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. The oxidation reactant was either O3 or H2O2, and the /uniFB02 uorination reactant was hydrogen /uniFB02 uoride (HF) derived from HF-pyridine. In the proposed reaction mechanism, the O3 reaction oxidizes the surface of the TiN substrate to a TiO 2 layer and gaseous NO. HF exposure to the TiO2 layer then produces TiF 4 and H2O as volatile reaction products. The overall reaction can be written as TiN + 3O3 + 4HF → TiF4 + 3O2 + NO + 2H2O. Quartz crystal microbalance studies showed that HF can spontaneously etch TiO2 /uniFB01 lms. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity analysis showed that TiN /uniFB01 lms were etched linearly versus the number of ALE cycles using O 3 and HF as the reactants. The TiN etching also occurred selectively in the

presence of Al O , HfO , ZrO , SiO , and Si N . The etch rate for TiN ALE was determined at temperatures from 150 to 350 2 3 2 2 2 3 4 ° C. The etch rates increased with temperature from 0.06 Å/cycle at 150 ° C to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 ° C and stayed nearly constant for temperatures ≥ 250 ° C. TiN ALE was also accomplished using H2O2 and HF as the reactants. The etch rate was 0.15 Å/cycle at 250 ° C. The TiN /uniFB01 lms were smoothed by TiN ALE using either the O3 or H2O2 oxidation reactants. The thermal ALE of many other metal nitrides should be possible using this new etching mechanism based on oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. This thermal ALE mechanism should also be applicable to metal carbides, metal sul /uniFB01 des, metal selenides, and elemental metals that have volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a thin/uniFB01 lm removal method based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. 1,2 ALE is usually de /uniFB01 ned by two separate reactions that enable atomiclevel removal of thin /uniFB01 lms. The ALE process is the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). 3,4 The /uniFB01 rst reaction during ALE is often an activation step where the surface of the /uniFB01 lm is modi ed /uniFB01 by adsorption of a reactive species. The second reaction is then the removal of this activated layer using highenergy collisions. 1,5 Energetic ions or noble gas atoms have been used to remove the activated material in many previously reported ALE processes. 1,6

Thermal ALE processes have also been developed recently using sequential, self-limiting /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. 7,8 For metal oxide ALE, a gas-phase /uniFB02 uorination reagent, such as HF, forms a stable and nonvolatile /uniFB02 uoride layer on the metal oxide /uniFB01 lm. Metal reagents then can remove the /uniFB02 uoride layer through ligand-exchange transmetalation reactions. 9 Thermal ALE processes for Al2 O3, HfO2, ZrO2, ZnO, SiO2, AlN, and AlF3 have been demonstrated using HF and various metal precursors such as Sn(acac)2 , trimethylaluminum, dimethylaluminum chloride, and silicon tetrachloride. 7,8,10 -18

The thermal ALE process using /uniFB02 uorination and ligandexchange reactions has not been able to etch some metal nitrides, such as titanium nitride (TiN). 15 TiN is an important material as a copper di /uniFB00 usion barrier and a complementary metal -oxide -semiconductor (CMOS) gate electrode material in semiconductor devices. 19,20 Previous thermal ALE studies have observed that TiN was not etched using HF together with a variety of metal precursors for ligand-exchange. 15 One reason for observing no etching is that the oxidation state of Ti in TiN is 3+. Fluorination would retain the oxidation state by /uniFB02 uorinating TiN to TiF3. However, the oxidation state of Ti is 4+ for most stable and volatile Ti compounds. The ligandexchange process for TiF3 does not produce a stable and volatile reaction product. 15

Di /uniFB00 erent approaches are needed for thermal TiN ALE. A new thermal ALE process can be de /uniFB01 ned by sequential, selflimiting oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions as illustrated in Figure 1. The /uniFB01 rst step is the oxidation reaction where an ozone (O3) exposure produces a titanium oxide (TiO2 ) surface layer on the TiN substrate:

Figure 1. Schematic for TiN ALE using O3 and HF as the reactants. O3 oxidizes the TiN substrate to form a TiO2 layer on the surface. Subsequently, HF removes the TiO2 layer by forming volatile TiF 4 and H2O reaction products.

$$T i N + 3 O _ { 3 } \to T i O _ { 2 } + N O + 3 O _ { 2 } \quad \quad ( 1 ) \quad \text{defin} _ { \substack { 1 \cdot \dots \\ 2 \cdot \dots \\ 2 } }$$

O3 is a strong oxidant that is able to convert the oxidation state of Ti from 3+ to 4+. This oxidation reaction is thermochemically favorable. 21 O3 can also form a stable, self-passivating TiO 2 layer. The TiO2 layer forms a di /uniFB00 usion barrier that impedes further oxidation and leads to a self-limiting oxidation reaction.

A /uniFB02 uorinating reagent, such as HF, can then react with TiO 2 and form a volatile titanium tetra /uniFB02 uoride (TiF4) reaction product:

$$T i O _ { 2 } + 4 H F & \to T i F _ { 4 } + 2 H _ { 2 } O & ( 2 ) \quad \underset { \text{using} } { \overset { 1 1 } { \text{ } } }$$

This /uniFB02 uorination reaction is thermochemically favorable at room temperature and becomes less favorable at higher temperatures. 21 The TiF4 reaction product will be removed from the surface because of its high volatility. H2O is also produced as a volatile reaction product. The O3 and HF reactions can then be repeated to etch the TiN substrate with atomic layer control.

The thermal ALE process shown in Figure 1 using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions is very di /uniFB00 erent from the previous thermal ALE approach using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. In the new process illustrated in Figure 1, HF etches the TiO2 layer by producing volatile TiF4. In contrast, the /uniFB02 uorination step in the previous thermal ALE approach has been used to form stable and nonvolatile metal /uniFB02 uorides such as AlF3, ZrF , and HfF . 4 4 8,11,13,15 These stable metal /uniFB02 uorides were then removed by a ligand-exchange reaction.

This new thermal ALE process should be valuable for a number of conducting transition metal nitrides such as TiN, VN, TaN, and WN. These metal nitrides have an oxidation state of 3+ that is lower than the oxidation state in their fully oxidized forms. The /uniFB02 uorides of these metal nitrides may have di /uniFB03 culty undergoing ligand-exchange reactions. However, oxidation can convert these metal nitrides to metal oxides with higher oxidation states. For example, the TiO2, V2O5, Ta2O5, and WO3 metal oxides have oxidation states of 4+, 5+, 5+, and 6+, respectively. The TiF , VF , TaF , and WF 4 5 5 6 metal /uniFB02 uorides that may form during the /uniFB02 uorination of these metal oxides have high volatility and share the same high oxidation states as their respective metal oxides.

In this work, thermal TiN ALE was demonstrated using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. O3 or H2O2 vapor was employed as the oxidation reactant. HF vapor derived from

HF-pyridine solution was used as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure the thicknesses of TiN thin /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers versus the number of ALE cycles. X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity measurement was also employed to con /uniFB01 rm the thickness changes as well as to determine the roughness of the TiN /uniFB01 lm after ALE reactions.

The oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions were also used to demonstrate the selective etching of TiN in the presence of other materials such as Al2 O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and Si3N4. These materials are all important materials in semiconductor fabrication processes. This thermal ALE strategy using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions that yield a volatile metal /uniFB02 uoride is general and should provide a pathway for the thermal ALE of a number of new materials. In addition to other metal nitrides, possible new materials include metal carbides, metal sul /uniFB01 des, metal selenides, and elemental metals.

## II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

All the reactions were conducted in a viscous/uniFB02 ow, hot-wall reactor de /uniFB01 ned by a stainless steel tube with the length of ∼ 60 cm and inside diameter of 3.8 cm. 22 The reactor was isothermally heated by heating elements attached to the outside of the stainless steel tube. The reaction temperatures from 150 to 350 ° C were stabilized within ± 0.04 ° C of the set point by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) temperature controller (2604, Eurotherm). A constant /uniFB02 ow of 150 sccm UHP nitrogen gas (N2, 99.999%, Airgas) was regulated by mass /uniFB02 ow controllers (Type 1179A, MKS). This N2 gas /uniFB02 ow established a base pressure of ∼ 1 Torr in the reactor when pumped by a mechanical pump (Pascal 2015SD, Alcatel). The pressure was recorded by a capacitance manometer (Baratron 121A, MKS).

The demonstration of spontaneous etching of TiO2 was performed using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) located at the center of the hot-wall reactor. 22 The gold-coated quartz crystal (polished, RC crystal, 6 MHz, Phillip Technologies) was placed in a sensor head (BSH-150, In /uniFB01 con) and sealed with high-temperature epoxy (Epo-Tek H21D, Epoxy Technology). The mass changes during the reactions were measured by a thin/uniFB01 lm deposition monitor (Maxtek TM-400, In /uniFB01 con). The TiO2 /uniFB01 lms were deposited on the QCMcrystal using TiO2 ALD with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl , 99%, 4 Strem) and deionized H2O (Chromasolv for HPLC, Sigma-Aldrich) as the reactants at 200, 250, and 300 ° C. 23 HF exposures on these TiO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were performed at the same temperature as the TiO 2 ALD reactions.

The HF source was a HF-pyridine solution (70 wt % HF, SigmaAldrich). A gold-plated stainless steel bubbler was /uniFB01 lled with the HFpyridine solution in a dry N2/uniFB01 lled glovebag and held at room temperature. A HF vapor pressure of 90 -100 Torr was in equilibrium with the HF-pyridine solution. 11 Only HF vapor was delivered in the gas phase as con /uniFB01 rmed by mass spectrometry. 24 The pressure transients of HF were adjusted to ∼ 80 mTorr using a metering bellows-sealed valve (SS-4BMG, Swagelok).

The O3 was produced in a corona discharge ozone generator (LG14, Del Ozone). A /uniFB02 ow of 480 sccm of UHP oxygen gas (O2, 99.994%, Airgas) was supplied to produce a maximum ∼ 5 wt % of O3 in O2. When the O3 was not delivered to the reactor, the O3 was passed through an ozone destruct unit (ODS-1, Ozone Solutions) connected to the exhaust line. Hydrogen peroxide (H O ) vapor was evaporated 2 2 with H2O from a H2O2 solution (50 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) contained in a glass bubbler. The H O 2 2 solution was held at room temperature.

The TiN /uniFB01 lms were prepared by SEMATECH. The TiN /uniFB01 lm was deposited on a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer by semiconductor ALD processes in commercially available tools. The initial thickness of TiN was measured as ∼ 70 Å by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements. The TiN /uniFB01 lm on the silicon wafers was cleaved to produce samples that were 1.25 cm by 1.25 cm in size and used in the ALE experiments. For the selectivity experiments, the Al2 O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and Si N 3 4 thin /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers were placed together with the TiN sample in the reactor. The Al O , HfO , and ZrO2 2 3 2 /uniFB01 lms

were prepared by SEMATECH and deposited by ALD processes. The SiO2 and Si N4 3 /uniFB01 lms were prepared by SEMATECH and deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes.

Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were coated inside the reactor before TiN ALE to minimize O3 decomposition on the walls of the hot-wall reactor. 25 The ALE reactions were conducted using a reaction sequence represented as x -30y -30. This reaction sequence consists of an exposure of the oxidation reagent for x s, 30 s of N 2 purge, y s of HF exposure, and 30 s of N2 purge. The ALE reactions using O3 as an oxidation reagent were performed using an optimized reaction sequence of 3-30-1-30. The ALE reactions using H2O2 as an oxidation source were performed using an optimized reaction sequence of 2.5-30-1-30.

Ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements determined the thicknesses of the various /uniFB01 lms. Ψ and Δ at 240 -900 nm were measured by a spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000, J. A. Woollam) and /uniFB01 tted by the analysis software (CompleteEASE, J. A. Woollam). These measurements employed an incidence angle of 75 ° near the Brewster angle of the silicon wafer. A Lorentz model was used for /uniFB01 tting the thickness of the TiN /uniFB01 lm. A Sellmeier model was used for /uniFB01 tting of the Al O , HfO , ZrO , SiO , and Si N 2 3 2 2 2 3 4 /uniFB01 lms.

The thicknesses, roughness, and /uniFB01 lm density were obtained by ex situ XRR analysis. The X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity (XRR) scans at 300 -9000 arcsec were measured by a high-resolution X-ray di /uniFB00 ractometer (Bede D1, Jordan Valley Semiconductors) using Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1.540 Å). The /uniFB01 lament voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 35 mA in the X-ray tube. All XRR scans were recorded with a 10 arcsec step size and a 5 s acquisition time and /uniFB01 tted using the analysis software (Bede REFS, Jordan Valley Semiconductors) to determine /uniFB01 lm thickness, /uniFB01 lm density, and surface roughness.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Spontaneous Etching of TiO2 by HF. Figure 2 shows the mass changes during 10 consecutive HF exposures on TiO 2

/uniFB01 lms grown on the quartz crystal microbalance. The TiO 2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were deposited using TiCl 4 and H2O as the reactants at 200, 250, and 300 ° C. 23 Each HF exposure for 1 s leads to a mass loss consistent with spontaneous etching of the TiO 2 /uniFB01 lm. The average mass change during the HF exposure is -17 ng/ cm 2 at 200 ° C. There are slightly higher mass changes at higher temperatures. Mass changes of -25 and -32 ng/cm 2 were obtained with the same HF exposure time of 1 s at 250 and 300 ° C, respectively. These results suggest that an HF exposure of 1 s is able to etch a TiO 2 thickness of 0.66 -0.85 Å at 250 -300 ° C based on the density of 3.76 g/cm 3 for TiO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms. 23

The /uniFB02 uorination reaction given by eq 2 has a standard reaction enthalpy Δ H ° = -22.7 kcal/mol at 25 ° C. 21 This negative enthalpy value is maintained at high temperatures with Δ H ° = -21.9 kcal/mol at 250 ° C. 21 The standard free energy of this reaction is favorable at room temperature with Δ G ° = -6.1 kcal/mol at 25 ° C. 21 The standard free energy change becomes unfavorable at temperatures &gt;150 ° C for entropic reasons. The Δ G ° value at 250 ° C is +6.3 kcal/mol. 21 However, the Δ G values for the HF reaction with TiO 2 may be negative and may predict a spontaneous reaction under nonstandard conditions. The etching could be favorable in the presence of excess of HF vapor when the TiF4 and H2O reaction products are quickly removed by the N2 purge gas.

B. Thermal TiN ALE Using O3 and HF. Previous studies have shown that HF by itself or in conjunction with other metal precursors cannot etch TiN. 15 However, HF is able to etch TiO2 spontaneously as shown in Figure 2. These results suggest that if a TiO 2 layer can be formed on a TiN substrate using an oxidizing reagent, then a /uniFB02 uorination reagent, such as HF, should be able to etch the TiO2 layer on the TiN substrate. These oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions de /uniFB01 ne the thermal TiN ALE process illustrated in Figure 1.

Ozone (O3) is a gas-phase reagent with strong oxidation power. O3 has often been preferred to O 2 as an oxygen source for metal oxide ALD when its stronger oxidizing ability is needed, or the H2O purge is di /uniFB03 cult. 26 In addition, O 3 is also known to form an excellent passivation oxide layer on polycrystalline aluminum metal or crystalline silicon. 27,28 O3 also can be employed as an oxidation reagent for the formation of a TiO2 layer on the TiN substrate.

The proposed oxidation reaction of TiN using O 3 is given by eq 1. This oxidation reaction is thermochemically favorable. The standard free energy of this reaction is Δ G ° = -242.1 kcal/ mol at 250 ° C. 21 Other nitrogen-containing reaction products in addition to NO, such as N 2 and NO2, may be possible. The Δ G ° values with N2 or NO2 as the reaction product yield favorable standard free energy values of Δ G ° = -219 or -288 kcal/mol at 250 ° C, respectively. 21

The /uniFB02 uorination reaction of HF with TiO 2 is given by eq 2. This reaction has Δ G ° values of -6.1 kcal/mol at 25 ° C and +6.3 kcal/mol at 250 ° C. 21 As discussed above in Section A, the positive Δ G ° value at 250 ° C does not preclude the reaction because the reactions are not performed under standard conditions. The production of TiF 4 can lead to etching because TiF4 is a volatile solid that sublimes at 284 ° C. 29

After HF removes the TiO2 layer on the TiN substrate, HF could also form TiF3 by /uniFB02 uorination of TiN. The reaction between TiN and HF is given by

$$\Omega, \quad T i N ( s ) + 3 H F ( g ) \to T i F _ { 3 } ( s ) + N H _ { 3 } ( g ) \quad \quad ( 3 )$$

This reaction is favorable with a Δ G ° value of -37.0 kcal/mol at 250 ° C. 21 TiF3 is a nonvolatile solid with a melting point of 1200 ° C and boiling point of 1400 ° C. 29 TiF3 may act as an etch stop. However, the HF reaction with TiN may not occur if HF does not remove the entire TiO2 /uniFB01 lm or does not remove the TiO N x y layer at the interface between TiO 2 and TiN.

Figure 3 shows the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and Xray re /uniFB02 ectivity (XRR) measurements of the initial TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness and the TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness after 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 ALE cycles using O3 and HF as the reactants at 250 ° C. The /uniFB01 lm thickness versus the number of ALE cycles is linear. An etch rate of 0.19 Å/cycle was obtained from the SE measurements using a least-squares /uniFB01 tting. The XRR measure-

ments on the same samples yielded an etch rate of 0.20 Å/ cycle. These XRR results are consistent with the SE results.

No TiN etch was observed when using O2 by itself as the oxidation reactant together with HF. The oxidation reaction TiN(s) + 3 /2 O2(g) → TiO2(s) + NO(g) is thermochemically favorable having a standard free energy change of Δ G ° = -113.7 kcal at 250 ° C. 21 However, the oxidation of TiN by O2 at &lt;350 ° C is known to slowly form a thin TiO 2 layer. 30,31 The surface of TiN also reacts with O 2 and creates an intermediate titanium oxynitride (TiO N ) phase, in addition to a thin TiO x y 2 layer. The oxidation state of Ti in this intermediate phase is 3+ and 4+ by XPS analysis. 30 The strong oxidizing ability of O3 may be necessary for the oxidation of TiN or TiO N x y to TiO2. The TiO2 layer can then be etched by HF during TiN ALE at 250 ° C.

Figure 4 shows the self-limiting behavior for the O 3 and HF exposures during TiN ALE at 250 ° C. The etch rates were obtained versus reactant exposure time while holding the other reactant exposure time constant. The etch rate was determined using the average thickness change during 200 ALE cycles. Figure 4a examines the self-limiting reaction using di /uniFB00 erent O3 exposure times with a HF exposure time of 1 s. A N2 purge time of 30 s was used between reactant exposures. The etch rate increases and levels o /uniFB00 at ∼ 0.2 Å/cycle versus the O3 exposure time. The oxidation of the TiN substrate is believed to be self-limiting because of the formation of a TiO 2 passivation layer on the TiN substrate that acts as a di /uniFB00 usion barrier. 32

Figure 4b examines the self-limiting reaction using di /uniFB00 erent HF exposure times with an O3 exposure time of 3 s. The etch rate versus the HF exposure time increases and levels o /uniFB00 at ∼ 0.2 Å/cycle. The /uniFB02 uorination reaction is self-limiting because the etching reaction to produce volatile TiF 4 and H2O is limited by the thickness of the TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate. HF does not etch the TiN /uniFB01 lm by itself. Figure 2 shows that an HF exposure of 1 s is able to remove 25 ng/cm 2 or 0.66 Å of a TiO 2 /uniFB01 lm at 250 ° C. This thickness of TiO 2 /uniFB01 lm removed by the HF exposure is much greater than the etch rate of 0.2 Å/cycle for the TiO2 layer on the TiN substrate.

Figure 5 shows results for TiN ALE in the presence of various materials. These results demonstrate the selective etching of TiN using O3 and HF as the reactants at 250 ° C.

There are negligible thickness changes for Al O , HfO , ZrO , 2 3 2 2 SiO2, and Si N 3 4 during the TiN ALE reactions. The O3 and HF exposures could not etch the Al2 O3, HfO2, and ZrO2 metal oxides because the /uniFB02 uorides of these metal oxides, AlF , HfF , 3 4 and ZrF4, are stable and nonvolatile. The O 3 and HF exposures

could also not etch silicon oxide and silicon nitride. In the absence of H2O, dry HF can not etch SiO2. 33 Previous thermal ALE studies using /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions could also not etch SiO2 or Si N4. 3 15 New approaches are needed for SiO2 ALE and Si3N4 ALE. 16,18

Figure 6 shows XRR scans for the initial TiN /uniFB01 lm on the Si wafer and for TiN /uniFB01 lms after various numbers of ALE cycles

with O3 and HF as the reactants at 250 ° C. The initial TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness is reduced linearly after various numbers of ALE cycles as shown in Figure 3. The XRR scans also reveal the roughness of the TiN /uniFB01 lms versus the ALE cycles. The roughness of initial TiN /uniFB01 lm was 9.3 Å. The roughness was then reduced as the TiN /uniFB01 lm was smoothed by the ALE process. The etched TiN /uniFB01 lms have roughness values of 8.5, 8.2, and 7.5 Å after 25, 50, and 100 ALE cycles, respectively. This decreased roughness versus number of TiN ALE cycles is consistent with the surface smoothing observed by previous studies of Al O 2 3 and HfO2 ALE using /uniFB02 uorination and ligandexchange reactions. 8,11

Figure 7 shows the TiN ALE etch rates obtained at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures using O3 and HF as the reactants. The etch rates were obtained by the average of the thickness change measured by SE after 200 ALE cycles. All ALE reactions used an optimized reaction sequence of 3-30-1-30. The etch rate is 0.060 Å/cycle at 150 ° C and increases to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 ° C. The etch rates are then constant with temperature between 250 and 350 ° C. This result may indicate that a similar thickness for the TiO 2 layer is formed by O 3 and removed by HF at 250 -350 ° C. The HF can only remove the amount of TiO2 that is formed during the O 3 exposure. This constant etch rate over a range of temperatures is similar to the ' ALD window ' often observed for many ALD processes. 4

O3 decomposition at high temperatures could a /uniFB00 ect the uniformity of the TiN /uniFB01 lm thicknesses in the reactor. 34 For exploration of this issue, studies were performed using 200 ALE cycles at 250, 300, and 350 ° C where the etch rate was nearly

constant according to the results in Figure 7. Five TiN /uniFB01 lm samples were placed within a length of 12.7 cm in the hot-wall reactor as shown in Figure 8. The TiN thicknesses were measured before and after the 200 ALE cycles to determine the uniformity of the TiN /uniFB01 lm.

Figure 8. Film thickness for (a) initial TiN /uniFB01 lm and (b) after 200 TiN ALE cycles at 250 ° C for di /uniFB00 erent locations in the reactor.

Figure 8 reveals that TiN ALE yielded fairly uniform TiN /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after 200 ALE cycles at 250 ° C. Positions 2 -5 yield an etch rate of 0.19 Å/cycle. In contrast, a slightly larger etch rate of 0.27 Å/cycle is observed in Position 1 close to the reactant entry into the hot-wall reactor. This slightly larger etch rate may correspond with larger reactant exposures at Position 1.

Figure 9 shows uniformity results obtained at a higher temperature of 350 ° C. These /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after 200 ALE cycles indicate that a lower etch rate is observed at the downstream positions. These downstream positions are furthest from the reactant entry into the hot-wall reactor. The recombination between gaseous O3 molecules is negligible at a reaction pressure of ∼ 1 Torr. 35 Consequently, this result

may indicate that O 3 is undergoing some decomposition on the surfaces of the hot-wall reactor.

The decomposition of O3 may be accelerated at the high temperature of 350 ° C. This decomposition may lead to lower O3 concentrations downstream in the reactor. These lower O 3 concentrations then produce lower TiN etch rates and thicker TiN /uniFB01 lm thicknesses. Similar e /uniFB00 ects were observed for ZnO ALD as a function of position in the reactor using Zn(CH2CH3)2 and O3 as the reactants. 25 Thinner ZnO ALD /uniFB01 lms were observed downstream in the reactor at 200 ° C because of the lower O3 concentrations. 25

C. Thermal TiN ALE Using H2O2 and HF. Other oxidants, in addition to O , may be able to oxidize the TiN substrate and 3 form a TiO2 layer. H O 2 2 is a strong oxidizer that has been used as a reactant for metal oxide ALD. 26 H2O2/H2O vapor derived from 30 to 50 wt % H2O2 solution has been used for ALD. H2O2 is a stronger oxidizer than O , but weaker than O . The 2 3 redox potential of oxidants measured in solution is consistent with this order of oxidant strength. 36

The proposed oxidation reaction of TiN using H2O2 can be expressed as

$$T i N ( s ) + 3 H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } ( g ) \to T i O _ { 2 } ( s ) + N O ( g ) + 3 H _ { 2 } O ( g )$$

This oxidation reaction is thermochemically favorable. The standard free energy is Δ G ° = -211.6 kcal/mol at 250 ° C. 21 Figure 10 shows the SE and XRR measurements of the initial TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness and the TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness after 50, 100, 200, and 400 ALE cycles using H O 2 2 and HF as the reactants at 250 ° C. The /uniFB01 lm thickness versus the number of ALE cycles is linear. An etch rate of 0.15 Å/cycle was obtained by SE using a least-squares /uniFB01 tting. The XRR measurements on the same samples yielded an etch rate of 0.14 Å/cycle that is consistent with the SE results.

The ALE reactions using H2O2 and HF were also selflimiting. However, achieving reproducible results was challenging because of changes in the H O 2 2 concentration. Purging the excess H2O after the H2O2/H2O exposure was also di /uniFB03 cult. There also may be a thermal decomposition of H2O2 at high temperatures. These factors contributed to making H O 2 2 more problematic than O3 as an oxidant for TiN ALE.

using H2O2 and HF as the reactants at 250 ° C. The initial TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness of 63 Å was reduced versus number of ALE cycles as shown in Figure 10. The initial TiN /uniFB01 lm roughness was 9.3 Å. This roughness was reduced to 8.1 Å after 50 cycles and 6.5 Å after 100 ALE cycles. These measurements indicate that the TiN /uniFB01 lms were smoothed by TiN ALE using H2O2 and HF as the reactants. These results are consistent with the TiN /uniFB01 lm smoothing obtained from Figure 6 during TiN ALE using O3 and HF as the reactants.

D. Generality of Thermal ALE Using Oxidation and Fluorination Reactions. The ALE of other materials including metal nitrides, metal sul /uniFB01 des, metal selenides, and

elemental metals should be possible using sequential, selflimiting oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. This approach requires that oxidation by oxidants, such as O3 and H2O2, is able to form a self-passivating metal oxide layer with a /uniFB01 nite thickness that prevents further oxidation. The /uniFB02 uorination reactants, such as HF and SF4, then remove only the metal oxide layer formed during the oxidation step. The removal occurs because the /uniFB02 uorides produced by the /uniFB02 uorination reactions are volatile. The oxygen in the metal oxide is removed as H2O and SO2 by HF and SF4, respectively.

ALE processes using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions for representative materials are given in Table 1. The oxidation

a Standard free energy change values are given at 250 ° C. 21

reactions for many transition metal nitrides that have volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides, such as TiN, to form their corresponding metal oxides are very favorable. The Δ G ° values for the oxidation of TiN, TaN, NbN, VN, W2N, Mo2N, MoN, and CrN using O3 to form TiO2, Ta2O5, Nb2O5, V2O5, WO3, MoO3, MoO3, and CrO3 are -241, -296, -284, -246, -294, -280, -298, and -238 kcal/mol at 250 ° C, respectively. 21 The Δ G ° values for oxidation using H2O2 are somewhat lower, but still very favorable, with Δ G ° values &lt; -200 kcal/mol. 21

The /uniFB02 uorinations of these metal oxides should all yield volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides. The Δ G ° values for the /uniFB02 uorination of TiO2, Ta2O5, Nb2O5, V2O5, WO3, MoO3, and CrO3 using SF4 to form TiF4 , TaF5, NbF5, VF5, WF6, MoF6, and CrF6 are -62, -79, -74, -45, -68, -53, and -40 kcal/mol at 250 ° C, respectively. 21 These metal /uniFB02 uorides are all volatile. For other metal nitrides that do not produce volatile /uniFB02 uorides after the /uniFB02 uorination of the metal oxide, a ligand-exchange reaction may be required to remove the metal /uniFB02 uoride. 10

Metal carbides are important materials that can be used as gate electrode materials with low work functions in semiconductor devices. 37 Metal carbides have many similar properties to metal nitrides such as structure, bonding characteristics, and electronic properties. 38 The oxidation reactions for transition metal carbides to form their corresponding metal oxides are very favorable. The Δ G ° values for the oxidation of TaC, VC, and W2C using O3 to form Ta2O5, V2O5, and WO3 are -369, -321, and -334 kcal/mol at 250 ° C, respectively. 21 These reactions assume CO as an etching product. The Ta O5, V O5, and WO3 2 2 metal oxides then should produce volatile /uniFB02 uorides during the /uniFB02 uorination reaction using HF or SF4.

Transition metal sul /uniFB01 des and selenides are important 2D semiconductor materials. 39 The oxidation of metal sul /uniFB01 des and selenides to form their corresponding metal oxides is also favorable. The Δ G ° values for the oxidation of WS2, MoS2, WSe2, and MoSe2 using O3 to form WO3, MoO3, WO3, and MoO3 are -553, -526, -531, and -515 kcal/mol at 250 ° C, respectively. 21 The oxidation should also yield volatile SO 2 or SeO3 reaction products. In addition to these thermochemical calculations, previous studies have recently reported the oxidation of WSe2 to form a WO x layer on WSe2. 40,41 These metal oxides should then form volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides after /uniFB02 uorination with SF . 4

Elemental metals with volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides can also be etched using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. The Δ G ° values for the oxidation of Ti, Ta, Nb, V, W, Mo, and Cr using O3 to form TiO2, Ta2O5, Nb2O5, V2O5, WO3, MoO3, and CrO3 are -288, -323, -305, -264, -296, -273, and -234 kcal/mol at 250 ° C, respectively. 21 The oxidation reaction is expected to form a self-passivating metal oxide on the surface of the metal. 32 If the oxide layer does not self-limit versus oxidant exposure, other milder oxidation reactants such as NO2, 42 N2O, 43 and NO 44 may be useful to obtain a self-limiting oxide thickness. These metal oxides should then form volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides after /uniFB02 uorination with HF or SF4.

The choice of the /uniFB02 uorination reactant is important for metal ALE using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions. Some metals will spontaneously etch with /uniFB02 uorination reactants that are stronger than HF. For example, XeF2 and F2 are both strong /uniFB02 uorination reagents. After removing the metal oxide, XeF 2 and F2 could proceed to etch the underlying metal spontaneously. For example, XeF2 spontaneously etches Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and metal alloys such as Ti/W. 45 In contrast, HF can often etch the metal oxide layer without etching the underlying metal.

Some metals will also be di /uniFB03 cult to etch using oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions because their metal oxides are not favorable or stable. For example, Re and Pt have volatile /uniFB02 uorides such as ReF 6 and PtF6, respectively. Re ALE may be di /uniFB03 cult because the thermochemistry for /uniFB02 uorination of ReO3 is not very favorable. The reaction ReO3(s) + 3 /2 SF4(g) → ReF6(g) + 3 /2 SO2(g) has a Δ G ° value of +9 kcal/mol at 250 ° C and becomes negative at &gt;450 ° C. 21 Pt ALE may also be di /uniFB03 cult because PtO3 is not a stable oxide. The formation of PtO2 on Pt may be possible, but PtF 4 is not volatile. 46

## IV. CONCLUSIONS

Thermal ALE of TiN can be accomplished using sequential oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions that yield volatile metal /uniFB02 uorides. This work employed two oxidation reagents, O 3 and H2O2, for the oxidation reaction. HF derived from HF-pyridine solution was then used for the /uniFB02 uorination reaction. TiN ALE occurred with a linear reduction of the TiN /uniFB01 lm thickness versus the number of ALE cycles. The etch rate of TiN ALE versus temperature using O 3 and HF as the reactants increased from 0.06 Å/cycle at 150 ° C to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 ° C. The etch rate was then constant at ≥ 250 ° C.

The selective etching of TiN was also observed in the presence of other materials using O 3 and HF as the reactants.

TiN ALE occurred selectively with no observed etching of the Al2 O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and Si N 3 4 surrounding materials. TiN ALE was also achieved using H2 O2 and HF as the reactants. An etch rate of 0.15 Å/cycle was measured at 250 ° C. TiN ALE led to surface smoothing when using either O3 or H2O2 as the oxidation reactant.

The overall etching reaction is believed to follow the following reaction: TiN + 3O 3 + 4HF → TiF4 + NO + 3O2 + 2H2O. In the proposed reaction mechanism, the oxidizing reactant, O , oxidizes TiN and forms a TiO 3 2 layer on the TiN substrate. The HF exposure then removes the TiO2 layer by producing volatile TiF 4 and H2O from TiO2. The ALE of many other metal nitrides should be possible using the oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination reactions that yield a volatile metal /uniFB02 uoride. This ALE reaction mechanism should also be applicable for the ALE of metal carbides, metal sul /uniFB01 des, metal selenides, and elemental metals.
