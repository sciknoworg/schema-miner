ABSTRACT: Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is an important technique for the precise isotropic etching of nanostructures. Thermal ALE of many materials can be achieved using a two-step /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reaction mechanism. Most previous thermal ALE processes have used HF as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant. Alternative /uniFB02 uorination reactants may be needed because HF is a weak nucleophilic /uniFB02 uorination reactant. Stronger /uniFB02 uorination agents may be required for the /uniFB02 uorination of some materials. To demonstrate the usefulness of SF4 as an alternative to HF, thermal Al2O3 ALE was compared using SF4 or HF together with Sn(acac)2 as the metal precursor for ligand exchange. SF4 and HF were observed to behave similarly as /uniFB02 uorination reactants during Al2 O3 ALE. The mass gains during the initial SF4 and HF exposures on Al2 O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) /uniFB01 lms at 200 ° C were

comparable at 35 and 38 ng/cm , respectively, using quartz crystal microbalance measurements. In addition, the etch rates were 2 similar at 0.20 and 0.28 Å/cycle for Al2 O3 ALE using SF4 and HF, respectively, at 200 ° C. Thermal VO2 ALE was also performed for the /uniFB01 rst time using SF4 or HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. There was evidence that SF4 is a stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactant than HF for VO 2 /uniFB02 uorination. The mass gains during the initial SF 4 and HF exposures on VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were 38 and 20 ng/cm , respectively, at 200 2 ° C. Thermal VO2 ALE also had a higher etch rate when /uniFB02 uorinating with SF 4 compared with HF. Etch rates of 0.30 and 0.11 Å/cycle were measured for VO2 ALE using SF4 and HF, respectively, together with Sn(acac)2 at 200 ° C. Fourier transform infrared experiments were also used to monitor /uniFB02 uorination of the Al O 2 3 and VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms by SF4 or HF. FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectroscopy was used to observe the increase of Al -F and V -F stretching vibrations and the loss of the Al -O and V  O/V  O stretching vibrations for Al O 2 3 and VO2, respectively, versus SF 4 or HF exposure at 200 ° C. Additional absorbance features after /uniFB02 uorination of the Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms by SF4 were consistent with SF x surface species. SF 4 is a useful /uniFB02 uorination agent for thermal ALE processes and can be used as an alternative to HF. In addition, SF 4 may be necessary when /uniFB02 uorination requires a stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactant than HF.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic layer etching (ALE) is possible using sequential and self-limiting surface reactions. 1 ALE is becoming increasingly important for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. 2 ALE can be viewed as the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). 3,4 ALE can be accomplished using either plasma or thermal methods. 1,5 The /uniFB01 rst reaction during ALE usually involves surface modi cation by the adsorption of a reactive /uniFB01 species that activates the surface. The second reaction during ALE is a reaction that produces a volatile etch product. In plasma ALE, the second reaction is the removal of the activated layer by sputtering using an energetic ion or neutral species. 1 Plasma ALE leads to anisotropic etching. 1 In thermal ALE, the second reaction is a reaction between a gaseous reactant and the surface layer that produces stable and volatile etching products. 5 Thermal ALE leads to isotropic etching. 6

and AlN ALE. 8,9 Other metal precursors such as Al(CH3)3, AlCl(CH3)2, SiCl4, and TiCl4 have also been e /uniFB00 ective for the ligand-exchange reaction following /uniFB02 uorination with HF. 10 -13 These reactants have led to Al O , HfO , and ZrO2 2 3 2 ALE. 10 -13 HF and Al(CH3)3 have also been used for SiO 2 and ZnO ALE using a ' conversion-etch ' mechanism, where Al(CH3)3 both is involved in ligand-exchange after /uniFB02 uorination and also converts the surface of the remaining substrate to Al O . 2 3 14,15

During thermal ALE, the main reaction that activates the surface has been /uniFB02 uorination. For example, thermal Al O 2 3 ALE was initially demonstrated using HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. 5,7 The mechanism for thermal Al2O3 ALE is based on /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. 5,7 HF and Sn(acac)2 have also been employed as the reactants for HfO 2

Although HF has been useful as a /uniFB02 uorination reactant during thermal ALE, HF does have some drawbacks. HF is a highly corrosive gas. 16 Upon contact with moisture, HF forms hydro /uniFB02 uoric acid, which is also corrosive and toxic. Anhydrous HF is particularly problematic because its vapor pressure at room temperature exceeds atmospheric pressure. HF-pyridine liquid sources of HF are safer because the vapor pressure of HF above the HF-pyridine solution is 90 -100 Torr at room temperature. 9 However, alternative /uniFB02 uorination reactants to

replace HF are desirable because HF is a weak /uniFB02 uorination reactant.

HF is a nucleophilic /uniFB02 uorination reactant where the /uniFB02 uoride anion serves as the active reaction species. HF is a convenient /uniFB02 uorination reactant that can /uniFB02 uorinate most metal oxides or metal nitrides. HF produces metal /uniFB02 uorides and H2O or NH3 as the reaction products. However, HF is a relatively weak /uniFB02 uorination agent compared with other inorganic nucleophilic /uniFB02 uorination reactants, such as SF4. Many electrophilic /uniFB02 uorinating agents also exist in which an electron-de /uniFB01 cient /uniFB02 uorine serves as the active reaction species. The most widely used inorganic electrophilic /uniFB02 uorination reactant is F . Another 2 common inorganic electrophilic /uniFB02 uorination reactant is XeF . 2

The standard free energy changes, Δ G ° , for the /uniFB02 uorination of a variety of materials using HF, SF , F , and XeF 4 2 2 are given in Table 1. 17 The Δ G ° values are all reported at 200 ° C. Most

of the Δ G ° values are negative except for HF /uniFB02 uorination of ZnS and VO2, which have slightly positive Δ G ° values. A comparison of the various Δ G ° values reveals that SF , F , and 4 2 XeF2 have higher negative Δ G ° values than HF for all the materials. SF , F , and XeF 4 2 2 are stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactants than HF and are all possible alternatives to HF.

In this paper, SF 4 was examined as an alternative to HF. SF 4 is an e /uniFB00 ective /uniFB02 uorination reactant for organic carbonyl compounds and metal oxides. 18,19 Previous work has also demonstrated that SF4 can /uniFB02 uorinate γ -Al O3. 2 20 The high SF4 vapor pressure of ∼ 10 atm at 25 ° C also facilitates the implementation of SF4. 21 However, although SF4 is considered a safer alternative to HF because SF 4 has a distinct sulfur odor, SF4 also has issues because hydrolysis of SF 4 can produce HF via SF 4 + H2O → SOF2 + 2HF. 22

SF4 was used as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant for the thermal ALE of Al2 O3 and VO2. Sn(acac)2 was used as the metal precursor for the ligand-exchange reaction. Al2 O3 ALE was studied to compare SF4 with the previous results using HF as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant for thermal Al2O3 ALE. 5,7,10,23 VO2 ALE was also examined using HF or SF4 and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. SF4 may be needed as the /uniFB02 uorination agent for thermal VO2 ALE. Thermochemical calculations indicate that the predicted Δ G ° for the /uniFB02 uorination of VO 2 to VF4 is slightly positive for HF at 200 ° C. 17 In contrast, /uniFB02 uorination of VO2 to VF4 has a large negative Δ G ° using SF4 at 200 ° C. 17

Thermal VO2 ALE is reported for the /uniFB01 rst time in this paper. VO2 is a semiconductor at room temperature and has a metal -insulator transition around 68 ° C. 24,25 This transition is accompanied by a large change in resistivity and optical transmittance. Consequently, VO2 is a useful material for thermochromic /uniFB01 lms, 25,26 bolometers, 27,28 and switching devices. 29,30 Thermal VO2 ALE may be useful to produce thin VO2 /uniFB01 lms with low thermal mass and high /uniFB01 lm stability. A low thermal mass is needed for larger thermal transients when using VO2 as a thermal sensor. Thin /uniFB01 lms employed for their metal -insulator transition are also less susceptible to fracture from stress that can result from temperature cycling and structural changes around the metal -insulator transition.

## II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

II.A. Growth and Etching of Al2O3 and VO2 Films. The initial Al2 O3 and VO2 /uniFB01 lms were prepared using Al2O3 and VO2 ALD. The Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms were grown using Al(CH3)3 (trimethylaluminum (TMA)) (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) and DI H2O as the reactants at deposition temperatures between 130 and 200 ° C. TMA and H2O are known to yield amorphous Al2O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms at these temperatures. 31 The VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were deposited using tetrakis(ethylmethylamino) vanadium (TEMAV) (Air Liquide) and DI H2O as the reactants at 150 ° C. 32 TEMAV is a useful vanadium source for VO2 ALD because vanadium is already in the +4 oxidation state. TEMAV and H2O are known to yield vanadium(IV) oxide /uniFB01 lms. 33 TEMAV and H2O also yield amorphous VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms at 150 ° C. 32,33

ALD /uniFB01 lms were deposited and etched in a custom-built stainless steel viscous /uniFB02 ow reactor. This reactor is similar in design to a previous viscous /uniFB02 ow reactor built for quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies of ALD. 34 However, the /uniFB02 ow tube was replaced with a circular puck-shaped chamber to accommodate 8 ″ wafers. The reactants and the carrier gas /uniFB02 ow across the samples in the chamber. The chamber had a 10 ″ diameter and was equipped with a fast-entry load-lock door for sample loading. The QCM was positioned at the center of this chamber.

A total N2 /uniFB02 ow of 160 sccm was used as both a purge and inert carrier gas during the reactions and produced a reactor pressure of 1.0 Torr. The N2 /uniFB02 ow was controlled on each precursor line by mass /uniFB02 ow controllers (Alicat Scienti /uniFB01 c). The N2 /uniFB02 ow was uniformly distributed inside the circular puck-shaped chamber using a ba /uniFB04 e that served to limit the gas conductance. The reactor was pumped with a dual-stage mechanical pump (Alcatel Adixen Pascal 2010 C2). The pressure was monitored using a capacitance manometer (MKS Baratron 626A) on the reactor. The temperature of the reactor chamber was maintained using heaters regulated with proportional -integral -derivative (PID) control.

The stainless steel bubbler containing the TEMAV was heated to 60 -65 ° C to increase the vapor pressure. An N2 /uniFB02 ow of ∼ 20 sccm over the headspace of the TEMAV source was also used to increase the precursor transport. The other growth reactants were maintained at room temperature. All lines were heated to de /uniFB01 ne a temperature gradient between the reactant sources and the reactor. The temperature progressively increased to prevent condensation in the dosing lines in the reactor chamber.

Al2 O3 ALE and VO2 ALE were performed using sulfur tetra /uniFB02 uoride (SF4, &gt;98.5%, SynQuest Laboratories), HF-pyridine (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich), and tin(II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2, 99.9% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich). SF 4 and HF-pyridine were maintained at room temperature. The Sn(acac)2 bubbler was heated to around 100 ° C to obtain adequate vapor pressure.

II.B. QCM, XPS, SE, and FTIR Measurements. The reactor chamber was equipped with an in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The QCM was an SC-cut quartz crystal (Maxtek SC-101 gold coated, 6 MHz). The frequency of the QCM was recorded using an In /uniFB01 con Q-pod quartz crystal monitor. The QCM housing was a modi ed In /uniFB01 /uniFB01 con Cool Drawer single sensor that used N2 /uniFB02 ow to provide a backside purge on the crystal. 34 The housing around the crystal was sealed using high temperature silver epoxy (Epo-Tek H21D, Epoxy Technology). The additional N2 /uniFB02 ow from the QCM purge exited downstream from the QCM crystal and raised the reactor pressure to 1.05 Torr when only N 2 was /uniFB02 owing.

The VO2 /uniFB01 lms on Si coupons were analyzed with ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600) after VO2 ALD to verify the chemical state of the /uniFB01 lm. The /uniFB01 lms were loaded into the XPS chamber within 1 h of unloading from the deposition chamber to reduce surface oxidation e /uniFB00 ects. In addition, the Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm thicknesses were investigated with ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam M-2000) both before and after etching at varying temperatures to determine the temperature dependence of Al O 2 3 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants.

In situ infrared spectroscopy was employed to monitor VO2 ALD and the /uniFB02 uorination of the Al O 2 3 and VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms with SF4 and HF. A description of this reactor, equipped for in situ FTIR transmission spectroscopy, has been presented earlier. 35 To increase the surface area for higher sensitivity to the surface species, the Al O 2 3 and VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were deposited on silicon nanoparticles that were 30 -50 nm in diameter (&gt;98%, US Research Nanomaterials). The Si nanoparticles were initially pressed into tungsten grids. 36,37 The tungsten grids have an area of 2 × 3 cm 2 and were 50 μ m thick and contained 100 grid lines per inch.

The tungsten grids were resistively heated to 150 ° C for VO2 ALD and 200 ° C for SF4 and HF /uniFB02 uorination of the Al O 2 3 and VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms. The heating was conducted using a DC power supply (6268B, 20 V/20 A, Hewlett-Packard). The voltage output of the DC power supply was controlled by a PID temperature controller (Love Controls 16B, Dwyer Instruments). The temperature was monitored with a K-type thermocouple. This thermocouple was /uniFB01 xed to the tungsten grid with epoxy (Ceramabond 571, Aremco). The epoxy also electrically isolated the thermocouple from the tungsten grid. The FTIR spectra were recorded at 150 ° C during VO2 ALD and at 200 ° C for Al2 O3 and VO2 /uniFB02 uorination.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

III.A. Al2 O3 ALE Using SF4 and Sn(acac)2. Figure 1 displays the mass change versus time during 100 cycles of Al2 O3 ALE at 200 ° C using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. The SF4 exposures were performed at 500 mTorr for 2.5 s. The Sn(acac)2 exposures were conducted at 50 mTorr for 2.5 s. After each reactant exposure, the system was purged with a viscous /uniFB02 ow of N2 gas at 160 sccm for 55 s. This reaction sequence is designated as 2.5 -55 -2.5 -55. The initial Al2 O3 /uniFB01 lm was deposited on the QCM with trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O as the reactants using 150 Al2O3 ALD cycles. The reaction sequence for Al O3 2 ALD was 3 -55 - -3 55. The purge times are longer than usual because of the design and larger volume of the reactor that could accommodate 8 ″ silicon wafers.

The loss of mass versus time is linear in Figure 1. The slight deviations from linearity are attributed to the e /uniFB00 ect of small temperature deviations on the QCM measurements over the course of the long experiments. The average mass change per

cycle (MCPC) over the 100 cycles is -6.0 ng/cm 2 . This MCPC yields an etch rate of 0.20 Å/cycle. The conversion between mass and thickness used an Al O3 2 ALD /uniFB01 lm density of 2.95 g/cm 3 determined by X-ray re /uniFB02 ectivity (Bede D1 System). This etch rate for Al2 O3 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 at 200 ° C is very comparable with the etch rate for Al2 O3 ALE using HF and Sn(acac)2 at 200 ° C. The etch rate for Al2 O3 ALE employing HF and Sn(acac)2 at 200 ° C was previously measured to be 0.28 Å/cycle. 5,7

surface and may produce AlF3 or AlF O x y surface species. AlF 3 is a stable /uniFB02 uoride with a melting temperature of 1290 ° C and an extremely low vapor pressure at 200 ° C. 38 In addition, SF 4 should remove oxygen from Al2O3 through SOF2 desorption. SOF2 is the main reaction product from the reaction of SF4 with metal oxides, H2O, or oxygen-containing organic compounds. 18,19,22 SF4 should also remove any possible acac

species on the surface from the previous Sn(acac) 2 exposure. The SF4 exposure leads to a mass gain Δ M SF4 = 6.2 ng/cm . 2

Sn(acac)2 can then react with the /uniFB02 uorinated Al O3 2 surface through ligand-exchange to form volatile SnF(acac) and Al(acac)3 or AlF(acac)2 species. Al(acac) 3 has a vapor pressure of 3.3 Torr at 150 ° C and ∼ 7 Torr at 200 ° C. 39,40 The net result of the Sn(acac)2 exposure is a mass loss Δ M Sn(acac)2 = -12.2 ng/cm . The gradual mass reduction during the purge 2 time of 55 s may be attributed to the slow desorption of acac species from the surface. Acac species were observed on Al O 2 3 surfaces during Al2 O3 ALE using HF and Sn(acac)2. 7 There was also an inverse correlation between the coverage of acac surface species and the Al2 O3 etch rate in these previous studies that was consistent with more desorption of acac species at higher substrate temperatures. 7

Assuming that the volatile etch products are Al(acac) , 3 SnF(acac), and SOF2, the overall reaction can be described as:

$$& \text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + 3 \text{SF} _ { 4 } + 6 \text{Sn} ( \text{acac} ) _ { 2 } & \quad \times 1 ( \text{num} \\ & \quad \to 2 \text{Al} ( \text{acac} ) _ { 3 } + 6 \text{Sn} F ( \text{acac} ) + 3 \text{SOF} _ { 2 } & ( 1 ) & \quad \text{the} \quad \text{$\text{$\text{$row$}$} }$$

This overall reaction can be divided into the proposed SF 4 and Sn(acac)2 reactions occurring during Al2 O3 ALE at steady state:

$$( A ) A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ^ { * } + 3 S F _ { 4 } ( g ) \to 2 A l F _ { 3 } | x S O F _ { 2 } ^ { * } + ( 3 - x ) S O F _ { 2 } ( g ) \quad \text{Al} _ { 2 } C \\ ( 2 ) \quad \text{cove} \\ \quad \text{Tr} \, \iota \, \iota \,.$$

$$( B ) & 2 \text{AlF} _ { 3 } \text{IxSOF} _ { 2 } ^ { * } + 6 \text{Sn} ( \text{acac} ) _ { 2 } ( g ) & \stackrel { \dots } { \text{Al} } _ { 2 } C \\ & \rightarrow 2 \text{Al} ( \text{acac} ) _ { 3 } ( g ) + 6 \text{Sn} F ( \text{acac} ) ( g ) + \text{xSOF} _ { 2 } ( g ) & \stackrel { \dots } { \text{Fi} } \\ & \stackrel { \text{Fi} } { \text{Sn} } ( a )$$

These reactions include the surface species that change during the SF4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures. The asterisks indicate the surface species. The vertical lines separate the various surface species. To satisfy the overall reaction stoichiometry in eq 1, the Δ M SF4 and Δ M Sn(acac)2 values require the presence of a surface intermediate that adds mass during reaction A and subtracts mass during reaction B. SOF2 * is the most likely surface intermediate produced during the SF4 exposure in reaction A. A schematic illustrating the proposed SF4 and Sn(acac)2 reactions is shown in Figure 3.

surface species after the SF 4 exposures relative to the amount of Al O3 2 that is etched in one Al O 2 3 ALE cycle. The parameter x can be determined by the Δ M Sn(acac)2 and MCPC values using the equation:

$$\stackrel { \aleph } { \text{t} } \quad x = [ M _ { \text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } } ( \Delta M _ { \text{Sn} (acac)} _ { 2 } } / M C P C ) - 2 M _ { \text{AlF} _ { 3 } } ] / M _ { \text{SOF} _ { 2 } } \quad ( 4 )$$

$$x = [ 1 0 2. 0 ( - 1 2. 2 / - 6. 0 ) - 2 ( 8 4. 0 ) ] / 8 6. 1 \quad \quad ( 5 )$$

The values 84.0, 102.0, and 86.1 are the molecular weights in atomic mass units for AlF3, Al2 O3, and SOF2, respectively. Using Δ M Sn(acac)2 = -12.2 ng/cm 2 and MCPC = -6.0 ng/cm , 2 eq 5 yields x = 0.46. This x value indicates that there are 0.46 SOF2 * species present on the surface after the SF 4 exposures for every Al O 2 3 unit etched during one Al O3 2 ALE cycle.

The MCPC and etch rate during Al2O3 ALE at 200 ° C using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 are -6.0 ng/cm 2 and 0.20 Å/cycle, respectively. This removal rate of Al O3 2 is equivalent to 3.54 × 10 13 Al2 O3 units/cm . This removal rate is only 2 ∼ 5% of the number of Al2O3 units on the Al O3 2 surface. An estimate for the number of Al2O3 units on the Al2O3 surface is obtained from the mass density of 3.0 g/cm 3 for Al O3 2 ALD /uniFB01 lms. This mass density is equivalent to a number density ρ = 1.77 × 10 22 Al2 O3 units/cm . 3 ρ 2/3 then provides an estimate for the number of Al2O3 units on the Al2 O3 surface of 6.8 × 10 14 Al2 O3 units/cm . 2 Based on the x value of 0.46, the SOF2 2 * coverage is determined to be 1.63 × 10 13 SOF2 * species/cm . This SOF2 * coverage is only about 2.4% of the number of Al2 O3 units on the Al O3 2 surface.

Figure 4 demonstrates the self-limiting nature of the SF 4 and Sn(acac)2 reactions during Al O 2 3 ALE. Each point represents the average mass change per cycle (MCPC) versus exposure time over 20 reaction cycles. In Figure 4a, the Sn(acac)2 exposure time was held constant at 2.5 s, and the SF 4 exposure time was varied from 0 to 3 s. The purge time after each reactant exposure was 55 s. This reactant pulse sequence is designated as X -55 -2.5 -55. Similarly, in Figure 4b, the SF 4 exposure time was held constant at 2.5 s, and the Sn(acac)2 exposure time was varied between 0 and 2.5 s. This reactant pulse sequence is denoted as 2.5 -55 - -X 55. The MCPC levels o /uniFB00 versus exposure time for both SF 4 and Sn(acac)2. In addition, neither reactant is capable of spontaneously etching the Al O3 2 /uniFB01 lm.

Other experiments have recently explored the e /uniFB00 ect of both exposure and pressure on Al2O3 /uniFB02 uorination using HF as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant. 41 These investigations have revealed that Al2 O3 /uniFB02 uorination is self-limiting as a function of exposure. The /uniFB02 uoride thickness, y , changes according to d /d y t = k / y where k is a constant that is dependent on HF pressure, k = k P 0 . Integration of this rate equation yields the parabolic expressions y 2 ( ) t = 2 kt or y ( ) t = (2 k Pt 0 ) 1/2 . The /uniFB02 uorination kinetics are restricted by the /uniFB02 uoride layer on the Al O 2 3 surface that acts as a di /uniFB00 usion barrier for further /uniFB02 uorination. The kinetics of Al O3 2 /uniFB02 uorination are similar to the kinetics of Si oxidation that have been described by the Deal -Grove model. 42,43 Similar behavior is expected for Al O 2 3 /uniFB02 uorination using SF4 as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant.

Figure 5 shows the /uniFB01 rst three cycles of Al O 2 3 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2. The mass gain observed during the /uniFB01 rst SF4 exposure represents the /uniFB02 uorination of an initial Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm prior to any Sn(acac) 2 exposures. The /uniFB01 rst SF4 exposure leads to a mass gain Δ M SF4 = 35.1 ng/cm . The SF4 2 exposure is believed to /uniFB02 uorinate the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm according to the reaction

given in Table 1: Al O 2 3 + 3SF4 → 2AlF3 + 3SOF2. The mass gain can be used to calculate the Al O 2 3 thickness converted to an AlF3 thickness by the SF 4 exposure. The mass change Δ M SF4 = 35.1 ng/cm 2 is consistent with the conversion of ∼ 1.8 Å of Al2 O3 to ∼ 3.1 Å of AlF3 . These thicknesses are based on the change in mass of 66 g/mol during Al O3 2 conversion to 2AlF , 3 an Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm density of 2.95 g/cm 3 from XRR, and an AlF3 density of 2.88 g/cm . 3

Figure 5 also shows that there is a mass gain Δ M Sn(acac)2 = 27.5 ng/cm 2 for the /uniFB01 rst Sn(acac)2 exposure after the initial SF4 exposure. Although Sn(acac)2 can undergo ligand exchange with the /uniFB02 uorinated surface, the net mass gain indicates that acac species are added to the surface during the /uniFB01 rst Sn(acac)2 exposure. Subsequently, the SF 4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures for the second and third reaction cycles are evolving to the steady-state etching behavior observed in Figure 2. This nucleation period occurs over approximately six reaction cycles.

Fluorination of the Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lm with SF4 and HF was also monitored with in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 6a

shows the di /uniFB00 erence spectra for 10 SF 4 exposures on the Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lm at 200 ° C. Each SF4 exposure was performed at 300 mTorr for 1 s. The di /uniFB00 erence spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectra after each SF4 exposure from the spectrum for the initial Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm. These di /uniFB00 erence spectra show the progressive /uniFB02 uorination of the Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm by the SF4 exposures according to the proposed reaction Al2 O3 + 3SF4 → 2AlF3 + 3SOF2.

Figure 6a demonstrates that a broad absorbance peak becomes larger at ∼ 700 cm -1 with increasing SF 4 exposures. This absorbance peak is assigned to an Al -F stretching vibration. 44,45 An additional absorbance peak is observed at ∼ 900 cm -1 . A broad shoulder is also present at frequencies between 400 and 600 cm -1 that are less than the frequency of the Al -F stretching vibration. These absorbance features are attributed to the presence of SF x species on the AlF 3 surface. SF2 stretching vibrations are observed in SF4 at ∼ 890 and ∼ 860 cm -1 46,47 . Additional stretching and deformation vibrational modes exist for SF 4 at ∼ 560 and ∼ 530 cm -1 46,47 . Likewise, a strong symmetric FSO deformation mode has been reported in SOF2 at ∼ 530 cm -1 48,49 .

Figure 6a also shows that a prominent absorbance loss occurs at ∼ 1000 cm -1 . This absorbance loss is attributed to the reduction of absorbance from Al -O stretching vibrations in Al2 O3. 13 In addition, there is an increase in the background absorbance during SF4 /uniFB02 uorination. This baseline shift is larger than the progressive loss of Al -O stretching vibrations with increasing SF4 exposures in Figure 6a. The origin of this increasing background absorbance with increasing SF4 exposures is not understood at this time.

For comparison, Figure 6b shows di /uniFB00 erence spectra for 10 HF exposures on the Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms at 200 ° C. These di /uniFB00 erence spectra have been displayed for clarity in presentation. Each HF exposure was conducted at 100 mTorr for 1 s. The di /uniFB00 erence spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectra after each HF exposure from the spectrum recorded for the initial Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lm. These di /uniFB00 erence spectra are consistent with the progressive /uniFB02 uorination of the Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lm by HF exposures according to the reaction Al2 O3 + 6HF → 2AlF3 + 3H2O. The HF exposures may also /uniFB02 uorinate the Al O3 2 ALD /uniFB01 lm to produce oxy /uniFB02 uorides by the reaction Al O 2 3 + z HF → 2AlO(6 -z )/4 F /2 z + ( z /2)H2O. 50

The absorbance peak from the Al -F stretching vibration in Figure 6b is located at ∼ 700 cm -1 13,44,45 . This absorbance peak progressively becomes larger with increasing HF exposures. A prominent absorbance loss also occurs at ∼ 1000 cm -1 resulting from the progressive loss of Al -O stretching vibrations from Al2 O3 with increasing HF exposure. 13 In contrast to the results for SF , absorbance gains at 4 ∼ 900 cm -1 and between 400 and 600 cm -1 are not observed for HF /uniFB02 uorination of Al O 2 3 because there are no SF x surface species. There is also no increase in the background absorbance during HF /uniFB02 uorination.

Figure 7 shows results for the temperature dependence of Al2 O3 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2. These results were obtained using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements with Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms on Si wafers. A spectroscopic ellipsometer was used to measure /uniFB01 lm thicknesses both before and after etching. The samples were initially coated with Al O 2 3 ALD /uniFB01 lms at 130 ° C. The individual samples were then etched for various numbers of cycles at temperatures from 150 to 225 ° C prior to the SE measurements. The Al2 O3 etch rates increased with temperature. The etch rates were 0.04 Å/cycle at 150 ° C, 0.07 Å/cycle at 175 ° C, 0.14 Å/cycle at 200 ° C, and 0.25 Å/cycle at 225 ° C. The etch rate of 0.14 Å/cycle at 200 ° C from these SE measurements is less than the etch rate of 0.2 Å/cycle from the QCM analysis in Figure 1. The SE measurements in Figure 7 provide the trends versus temperature but are not as accurate as the QCM analysis because they are based on only 2 -3 data points.

An Arrhenius plot of these temperature-dependent etch rates yields an activation barrier of 44 kcal/mol. This activation barrier of 44 kcal/mol could result from the temperature dependence of the /uniFB02 uorination reaction. Higher temperatures should produce progressively thicker /uniFB02 uoride layers on Al O . 2 3 If these /uniFB02 uoride layers are removed during the ligand-exchange reaction, then the Al2 O3 etch rates would be expected to be temperature-dependent. The activation barrier may also be associated with the Sn(acac)2 ligand-exchange reaction. The ligand-exchange reaction may leave acac species on the Al O 2 3 surface that may block the etching. 7 Removing these acac species would then increase the etching. The thermal desorption of these acac species may produce temperaturedependent Al2O3 etch rates. 7

III.B. VO2 ALD Using TEMAV and H2O. VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were grown using TEMAV and H2O prior to the VO2 ALE studies. Figure 8 shows the linear growth of VO 2 ALD /uniFB01 lms at

Figure 8. Mass change versus time during 125 cycles of VO2 ALD at 150 ° C using TEMAV and H2O as the reactants. Growth rate is 0.63 Å/cycle.

150 ° C for 125 reaction cycles. Each reaction cycle consisted of two 2 s TEMAV exposures, followed by a 60 s N2 gas purge, a 3 s H2O exposure, and then a 60 s purge. The TEMAV pressure was 25 mTorr. Two exposures of TEMAV were used for every reaction cycle to ensure that the surface reaction reached completion. The H2O pressure was 100 mTorr. The mass gain per cycle is 27.4 ng/cm . This mass gain per cycle is 2 consistent with a VO2 growth rate of 0.63 Å/cycle. This growth rate is based on a /uniFB01 lm density of 4.36 g/cm 3 measured by XRR. This growth rate is in agreement with the previously reported VO2 ALD growth rate of 0.67 Å/cycle using TEMAV and H2O at 150 ° C. 32,33

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to con /uniFB01 rm the stoichiometry of the VO2 /uniFB01 lms. Figure 9 shows

Figure 9. XPS spectrum of VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm in the O 1s and V 2p regions. Quanti /uniFB01 cation of the V 2p 3/2 peak indicates 94.4% VO2 (V 4+ ) and 5.6% V2O5 (V 5+ ).

the XPS spectrum in the O 1s and V 2p regions. Curve /uniFB01 ttings of the O 1s and V 2p regions are consistent with mostly a VO 2 /uniFB01 lm with a small component of V2O5. The percentages were 94.4% VO2 and 5.6% V2O5. The peak position was calibrated using the O 1s binding energy set at 530 eV with a single Shirley background over the entire O 1s and V 2p areas. The vanadium(IV) oxide and vanadium(V) oxide V 2p1/2 -V 2p3/2 splitting was /uniFB01 xed at 7.33 eV and the 2p1/2 to 2p3/2 ratio was /uniFB01 xed at 2:1. 51,52

The growth of the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms using TEMAV and H2O at 150 ° C was also investigated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The TEMAV exposure was performed at 10 mTorr for 2 s. The H2O exposure was de /uniFB01 ned with a pressure of 100 mTorr for 1 s. A 60 s viscous /uniFB02 ow N2 purge at 1 Torr was employed after each reactant exposure. The FTIR spectra were also recorded after each reactant exposure.

Figure 10 shows the FTIR spectra at 150 ° C after every 5 cycles of VO2 ALD using TEMAV and H2O for a total of 35 cycles. The spectra shown in Figure 10 were obtained after the H2O exposures. There is a strong and broad absorbance that is centered at approximately 630 cm -1 . This absorbance peak progressively increases with the number of ALD cycles. This absorbance feature is attributed to V -O stretching vibrations. 53,54 Earlier infrared vibrational spectroscopy studies of

Figure 10. FTIR spectra recorded at 150 ° C after every 5 cycles of VO2 ALD for 35 cycles using TEMAV and H2O as the reactants at 150 ° C.

crystalline VO 2 demonstrated that the vibrational spectrum of VO2 becomes featureless in the metallic state above the metal -insulator transition at 68 ° C. 54 In contrast, vibrational features are observed in Figure 10 for the amorphous VO 2 /uniFB01 lms at 150 ° C. However, evidence of an increase in the background absorbance was observed from 400 to 4000 cm -1 during VO2 ALD.

Absorbance from another vibrational mode centered at ∼ 996 cm -1 also increases mostly during the initial cycles of VO2 ALD. This absorbance feature is attributed to V  O vibrations. 53,55 The V  O vibration is associated with a terminal oxygen that is likely at the surface of the VO 2 ALD /uniFB01 lm. 53,55 During the later cycles of VO 2 ALD, this absorbance is increasing more slowly because of some V  O vibrations in the VO2 /uniFB01 lm and because of the increasing background absorbance. The frequency of the V  O vibration is also associated with the oxidation state of the vanadium. 53 The observation of the V  O vibrational feature at ∼ 996 cm -1 may be an indicator for vanadium in the +4 oxidation state. 53

III.C. VO2 ALE Using SF4 or HF and Sn(acac)2. Etching of the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms was performed using SF4 or HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. Figure 11 shows the mass change versus time during VO2 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants at 200 ° C. The reactant exposure sequence was 3 -55 - -3 55. The SF4 pressure was 500 mTorr. The Sn(acac)2 pressure was ∼ 50 mTorr. Figure 11 reveals that a linear mass loss is observed during VO 2 ALE over 50 cycles. The average MCPC is -13.2 ng/cm 2 for the 50 cycles. Based on a VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm density of 4.36 g/cm 3 from XRR measurements, the etch rate is 0.30 Å/cycle at 200 ° C. Additional experiments revealed that the etch rates were in the self-limiting regime for SF4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures of 3 s.

An expanded view of three VO2 ALE cycles from Figure 11 is shown in Figure 12. The SF4 exposure leads to a mass gain Δ M SF4 = 9.8 ng/cm 2 . This mass gain is attributed to /uniFB02 uorination of the VO2 surface to VF 4 or a VO F x y oxy /uniFB02 uoride. VF4 is a fairly stable metal /uniFB02 uoride with a melting temperature at 325 ° C. SF4 may also leave SOF2 on the surface similar to

Figure 11. Mass change versus time during VO2 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants at 200 ° C. Etch rate is 0.30 Å/cycle.

the proposed reactions for Al O 2 3 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2. The subsequent Sn(acac)2 exposure then produces a mass loss Δ M Sn(acac)2 = -23.1 ng/cm . This mass loss is consistent with 2 Sn(acac)2 removing the VF4 surface layer by a ligand-exchange reaction along with any SOF2 surface species to produce volatile products such as VF2(acac)2, SnF(acac), and SOF2. There is very little information on VF (acac) 2 2 in the literature. However, VCl2(acac)2 is used in the synthesis of other vanadium compounds. 56,57 The Sn(acac)2 exposure may also lead to SnF(acac) species adsorbed on the VO2 surface.

If the volatile etch products are VF (acac) , SnF(acac), and 2 2 SOF2, the overall reaction can be written as

$$& \text{VO} _ { 2 } + 2 \text{SF} _ { 4 } + 2 \text{Sn} ( \text{acac} ) _ { 2 } \\ & \rightarrow \text{VF} _ { 2 } ( \text{acac} ) _ { 2 } + 2 \text{Sn} F ( \text{acac} ) + 2 \text{SOF} _ { 2 } \text{ \quad \ (6)} \text{ \quad \ \ } \text{$\text{$\text{$The}$} }$$

This overall reaction can then be divided into the proposed SF4 and Sn(acac)2 reactions occurring during VO2 ALE at steady state

$$( A ) V O _ { 2 } ^ { * } + 2 S F _ { 4 } \to V F _ { 4 } | x S O F _ { 2 } ^ { * } + ( 2 - x ) S O F _ { 2 } \quad ( 7 )$$

$$& ( B ) V F _ { 4 } | x S O F _ { 2 } ^ { * } + 2 S n ( a c a c ) _ { 2 } \\ & \quad \rightarrow V F _ { 2 } ( a c a c ) _ { 2 } + 2 S n F ( a c a c ) + x S O F _ { 2 }$$

These reactions include the surface species that are believed to change during the SF4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures. The asterisks again indicate the surface species, and the vertical lines separate the various surface species. Assuming the reaction stoichiometry given in eq 6, the Δ M SF4 and Δ M Sn(acac)2 values require a surface intermediate that adds mass during reaction A and subtracts mass during reaction B. Therefore, SOF2 * is included as a surface intermediate in eqs 7 and 8.

VO2 * shown in eq 7 is the amount of VO2 that is etched during the ALE reactions. 7 x quanti /uniFB01 es the amount of SOF2 * species on the surface after the SF4 exposure relative to the amount of VO2 that is etched in one VO2 ALE cycle. The parameter x can be determined by the Δ M Sn(acac)2 and MCPC values using the equation:

$$x = [ M _ { V O _ { 2 } } ( \Delta M _ { S n ( a c a ) _ { 2 } } / M C P C ) - M _ { V O _ { 2 } } ] / M _ { S O F _ { 2 } } \quad ( 9 )$$

$$| \quad x = [ 8 2. 9 ( - 2 3. 1 / - 1 3. 2 ) - 1 2 6. 9 ] / 8 6. 1 \quad \quad ( 1 0 )$$

The values 126.9, 82.9, and 86.1 are the molecular weights for VF4, VO2, and SOF2, respectively. Using Δ M Sn(acac)2 = -23.1 ng/cm 2 and MCPC = -13.2 ng/cm , eq 10 yields 2 x = 0.21. This x value reveals that there are 0.21 SOF 2 * species present on the surface after the SF4 exposures for every VO2 unit etched during one VO2 ALE cycle.

The MCPC and etch rate during VO2 ALE at 200 ° C using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 are -13.2 ng/cm 2 and 0.30 Å/cycle, respectively. This removal rate of VO 2 is equivalent to 9.58 × 10 13 VO2 units/cm . The density of the VO2 2 ALD /uniFB01 lms is 4.36 g/cm 3 from XRR measurements. This density yields an estimate of 1.00 × 10 15 VO2 units/cm 2 for the number of VO2 units on the VO2 surface. The VO2 removal rate is about 9.6% of the number of VO2 units on the VO2 surface. Based on the x value of 0.21, the SOF2 * coverage is determined to be 2.01 × 10 13 SOF2 * species/cm . This SOF2 2 * coverage is about 2.0% of the number of VO2 units on the VO2 surface.

The mass changes during the SF4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures decrease slightly as the etching proceeds. However, the MCPC stays nearly constant at -13.2 ng/cm 2 averaged over the 50 cycles in Figure 11. The slight decrease in the mass changes during the SF4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures may result from slow changes in the surface composition. There is a possibility that the Sn(acac)2 reactant may be able to remove some vanadium species from the VO2 /uniFB01 lm as vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2). The removal of VO(acac)2 would change the V/O ratio on the surface and perhaps slowly a /uniFB00 ect the etch rate.

III.D. Fluorination of VO2 Using SF4 or HF. QCM experiments explored the e /uniFB00 ect of SF4 exposure on an initial VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm independent of any acac surface species. Figure 13 shows the /uniFB01 rst three VO 2 ALE cycles on an initial VO 2 ALD /uniFB01 lm using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. The /uniFB01 rst SF4 exposure leads to a mass gain Δ M SF4 = 38.5 ng/cm 2 at 200 ° C. The SF4 exposure was conducted at 500 mTorr for 3 s. The SF4 exposure is believed to /uniFB02 uorinate the VO2 /uniFB01 lm according to the reaction given in Table 1: VO 2 + 2SF4 → VF4 + 2SOF2. The mass gain can be used to calculate the VO2 thickness

Figure 13. First three cycles of VO 2 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 at 200 ° C showing initial mass gain from /uniFB02 uorination during SF4 exposure and mass changes during the /uniFB01 rst Sn(acac)2 exposure and subsequent SF4 and Sn(acac)2 exposures.

converted to VF4 by the SF4 exposure. The mass change of Δ M SF4 = 38.5 ng/cm 2 is consistent with the conversion of ∼ 1.6 Å of VO2 to ∼ 3.7 Å of VF . These thicknesses are based on the 4 change in mass of 44 g/mol during VO2 conversion to VF4, a VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm density of 4.36 g/cm 3 from XRR, and a VF4 density of 2.98 g/cm . 3

Figure 14 shows additional QCM measurements that compare the mass gain during the /uniFB02 uorination of the initial

VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm using either SF 4 or HF. The SF4 exposure at 500 mTorr leads to a much higher mass gain than the HF exposures at either 60 or 500 mTorr. The mass gain resulting from the SF4 exposures is 38.5 ng/cm . The mass gain from the 2 HF exposures is 20.5 ng/cm 2 and is independent of the HF pressure. The higher mass gain from the SF4 exposures probably cannot be explained solely by the presence of SOF 2 * species on the VO2 surface. The SOF2 * coverage of 2.01 ×

10 13 SOF2 * species/cm 2 present after the SF 4 exposures during steady state VO 2 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2 is equivalent to a mass of 2.9 ng/cm . 2

The ability of the HF to /uniFB02 uorinate the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm was initially questioned because the Δ G ° value for the VO 2 + 4HF → VF4 + 2H2O reaction is positive at Δ G ° = +9 kcal. The mass gain with HF exposure suggests that other /uniFB02 uorination reactions may be possible. For example, a sub /uniFB02 uoride of vanadium may be formed from the reaction VO2 + HF → VOF2 + H2O. This reaction has a negative standard free energy value Δ G ° = -1.58 kcal/mol at 200 ° C.

To explore further the VO2 /uniFB02 uorination, in situ FTIR spectroscopy studies were used to monitor the /uniFB02 uorination of VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms with SF 4 and HF at 200 ° C. Figure 15 displays

Figure 15. FTIR spectra recorded at 200 ° C during /uniFB02 uorination of the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm at 200 ° C. (a) Di /uniFB00 erence spectra for 10 SF 4 exposures on the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm. (b) Di /uniFB00 erence spectra for 10 HF exposures on the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm.

the /uniFB02 uorination of the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm using either SF 4 or HF exposures. Figure 15a shows the di /uniFB00 erence spectra for the /uniFB02 uorination using 10 consecutive SF4 exposures. Each SF4 exposure was de /uniFB01 ned by a pressure of 300 mTorr for 1 s. Figure 15b shows the di /uniFB00 erence spectra for the progressive /uniFB02 uorination using 10 consecutive HF exposures. These di /uniFB00 erence spectra have been displaced for clarity in presentation. Each HF exposure was de /uniFB01 ned by a pressure of 100 mTorr for 1 s. The reference spectrum for the di /uniFB00 erence spectra in Figures 15a and 15b was the spectrum of the initial VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm.

Broad absorbance gains centered at ∼ 650 and ∼ 590 cm -1 are observed for both SF 4 and HF exposures, respectively. This absorbance gain is consistent with V -F stretching vibrations. Previous investigations have observed the V -F stretching vibration at 530 cm -1 in VF4 and at 540 cm -1 in VF3. 58 The

slightly higher frequencies observed during the /uniFB02 uorination of VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms may be attributed to the presence of oxy /uniFB02 uorides and the higher V -F frequencies in vanadium oxy /uniFB02 uorides. 59 In comparison with the results for SF 4 on Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms displayed in Figure 6a, no prominent absorbance gains are observed at ∼ 900 cm -1 or 530 -560 cm -1 in Figure 15a that would be consistent with an abundance of SF x surface species. 46 -49 The absence of these absorbance gains is consistent with the lower x value for VO2 ALE using SF4 and Sn(acac)2.

Another prominent absorbance feature in Figure 15 is the absorbance loss at ∼ 1000 cm -1 after both SF4 and HF exposures. The loss of this V  Ostretching vibration would be expected during /uniFB02 uorination if the V  Ovibrational modes are primarily on the surface of the VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lm. Fluorination with SF4 also produces a small absorbance gain in the di /uniFB00 erence spectrum in Figure 15a at ∼ 1045 cm -1 . This absorbance gain may again be indicative of vanadium oxy /uniFB02 uorides with vanadium atoms bonded to both oxygen and /uniFB02 uorine atoms. 59

## IV. CONCLUSIONS

Fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions can be employed for thermal ALE. HF has been the most common /uniFB02 uorination reactant. However, HF is a fairly weak nucleophilic /uniFB02 uorination reactant. Stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactants may be useful as an alternative to HF. One possible option is SF4. The thermal ALE of Al2O3 and VO2 was explored using both SF 4 and HF as /uniFB02 uorination reactants together with Sn(acac)2 as the metal precursor for ligand-exchange.

SF4 and HF were very comparable as /uniFB02 uorination reactants during Al2 O3 ALE. The mass gains during the initial /uniFB02 uorination of Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms at 200 ° C were 35 and 38 ng/cm 2 using SF4 and HF, respectively. In addition, the etch rates for Al2 O3 ALD /uniFB01 lms using SF4 and HF, together with Sn(acac)2, were 0.20 and 0.28 Å/cycle, respectively, at 200 ° C. SF4 is an e /uniFB00 ective alternative to HF for Al O 2 3 thermal ALE.

SF4 was also compared to HF for VO2 ALE. The mass gains during the initial SF4 and HF exposures on VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms were 38 and 20 ng/cm , respectively. The larger 2 /uniFB02 uorination when using SF4 also led to higher VO 2 etch rates. Etch rates of 0.30 and 0.11 Å/cycle were measured for VO2 ALE using SF4 and HF, respectively, together with Sn(acac) 2 at 200 ° C. The more favorable thermochemistry for VO2 /uniFB02 uorination by SF4 leads to a larger etch rate.

Additional FTIR experiments were also conducted to observe the /uniFB02 uorination of the Al O 2 3 and VO2 ALD /uniFB01 lms by SF4 or HF. These studies revealed that SF4 and HF were comparable as /uniFB02 uorination reactants. The FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectra were used to monitor the growth of Al -F and V -F stretching vibrations and the loss of Al -O and V  O stretching vibrations for Al2 O3 and VO2, respectively, versus SF4 or HF exposure. The FTIR di /uniFB00 erence spectra also suggested that S -F stretching vibrations from SF x surface species were present on Al2O3 after SF4 exposures. SF4 is a useful /uniFB02 uorination reactant for thermal ALE. SF4 is also a stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactant that may be needed for etching some materials.
