The present study investigates the cyclic etching of TiO2 with CF polymer deposition and removal. We find that C4F8 plasma treatment forms a CF polymer deposition layer on the TiO2 and a modified TiO2 surface under the CF polymer layer. Subsequent O2 plasma treatment removes the CF polymer and the modified layer at the same time. This sequence is repeated. Accordingly, the TiO2 film is etched at a rate of 0.67 nm per cycle. The CF polymer and modified TiO2 layer also form on the sidewall TiO2 surface of a trench pattern. We realize the isotropic TiO2 etching of a trench pattern having a high aspect ratio exceeding 40 adopting the cyclic C4F8 and O2 plasma process. © 2021 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

## 1. Introduction

Flash memory devices have changed from planar to threedimensional (3D) structures, comprising vertically stacked memory cells that require the formation of small and highaspect-ratio spaces, to meet market demands for increased storage capacity. In general, 3D /uniFB02 ash memory has a plurality of holes formed by alternating layers of conducting and insulating materials. The conducting layers act as control gates. Memory cells form on the sidewalls of holes. A memory cell usually comprises a SiO2 layer, Si 3 N4 layer, and another SiO2 layer as a gate dielectric, a charge trap layer, and a tunnel dielectric layer. These memory cell layers do not require insulation between control gates. However, some types of 3D memory require the insulation of memory cells. Such types of 3D memory require the recession of conducting materials after holes are formed for this purpose. Memory cell /uniFB01 lms are then deposited along the recessed regions and the sidewalls, and predetermined portions of the /uniFB01 lms are removed to provide insulation through isotropic etching. 1 4) -A challenging requirement of 3D memory devices is to control the amount of etching of these /uniFB01 lms precisely. Moreover, the most dif /uniFB01 cult aspect of this process is that the amount of etching needs to be uniform from the top to the bottom of the high-aspect-ratio pattern. The memory cell /uniFB01 lms comprise various materials, such as W, TiN, Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Si, Si3N4, and SiO2. 5)

Several studies have investigated isotropic atomic layer etching (ALE) to meet the demand for increased storage capacity in recent years. 6 -25) These studies can be classi /uniFB01 ed as those on wet ALE and those on thermal ALE. Yin et al. demonstrated isotropic SiGe etching adopting wet solution oxidation. 7) However, the wet process faces the problem of pattern collapse. 8) Thermal ALE, called ligand exchange, 9 13) -and conversion etching 14 -17) have been employed for metal oxide materials; e.g. Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, ZnO, WO3, TiO2, GaN, and SiO2. These processes are the reverse of atomic layer deposition, which requires a high temperature exceeding 150 °C and a metal coreagent such as trimethylaluminum, tin acetylacetone, dimethylaluminum chloride, or silicon tetrachloride. Izawa s group reported the thermal ALE ' of Si3N4 using the formation and desorption of ammonium /uniFB02 uorosilicate. 18 -20) They used /uniFB02 uorocarbon radicals to form ammonium /uniFB02 uorosilicate on a Si3N4 surface at room temperature and then desorbed the ammonium /uniFB02 uorosilicate at a temperature exceeding 100 °C. This requires a cycle of wafer cooling and annealing, and they thus developed a special 300 mm tool with an infrared lamp for rapid cycling. 19) In addition, the high-temperature process adopted in thermal ALE can degrade the device performance. A lowtemperature process that can be realized preferentially with a conventional tool is thus needed.

In this paper, we report on an isotropic cycle etching of TiO2 that can be realized at a low temperature of 60 °C using a conventional capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) reactive ion etching (RIE) tool. We suggest the mechanism of cycle etching and demonstrate the sidewall TiO2 etching of a trench pattern with a high aspect ratio of more than 40.

## 2. Experimental methods

A 10 nm thick amorphous TiO2 blanket /uniFB01 lm was deposited on a 300 mm Si wafer through atomic layer deposition. We used tetrakis dimethyl amino titanium and O3 as a precursor and oxidant, respectively. The process temperature of the atomic layer deposition was 200 °C. In addition to the blanket sample, we used two types of patterned sample having different aspect ratios. One was a SiO2 line and space pattern with an aspect ratio 16.5. The 330 nm thick SiO2 was deposited on 30 nm thick Si3N4 and etched through RIE. We used spin-on-coat polymer /uniFB01 lm as the SiO2 etching mask of the line and space pattern with a half-pitch of 40 nm. After the SiO2 etching, the spin-on-coat /uniFB01 lm was removed through ashing. A 10 nm thick layer of TiO2 was then deposited. The space after TiO2 deposition was 20 nm. The other sample was a SiO2 trench pattern with an aspect ratio of 46. The 3500 nm thick SiO2 was deposited on a Si substrate and etched through RIE. We used amorphous carbon /uniFB01 lm with a slit width of 100 nm as the mask of the trench pattern. The carbon layer was removed after SiO2 RIE. A 10 nm thick layer of TiO2 was deposited and the space after the deposition was 80 nm. Etching experiments were carried out using a CCP RIE system (Tokyo Electron, Vesta-RBH). Radiofrequency (100 MHz) power was applied to the substrate to induce plasma. Conditions to which the TiO2 /uniFB01 lm was exposed are listed in Table I. Ellipsometry was adopted to measure the thickness of the TiO2 blanket /uniFB01 lm and the etched amount of /uniFB01 lm was calculated from the thickness before and after the plasma treatments.

microscopy (TEM) was adopted to measure the sidewall TiO2 /uniFB01 lm thickness of the pattern samples. We also adopted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the bonding states of the blanket /uniFB01 lm surface and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to analyze the atomic composition of the sidewall /uniFB01 lm of the pattern samples.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. TiO2 etching with CF4 plasma

Figure 1 shows the amount of etching of the TiO2 blanket /uniFB01 lm with CF4 plasma. The plasma conditions were pressure of 1.3 Pa, 100 MHz radio-frequency power of 1000 W, a CF4 gas /uniFB02 ow rate of 100 sccm, and a substrate temperature of 60 °C. The etched amount increased linearly with the treatment time as expected and the etching rate was 12.5 nm min -1 . We next con /uniFB01 rm the amount of etching of the sidewall TiO2 /uniFB01 lm. Figure 2(a) shows the cross-sectional TEM image of the line and space patterned sample with an aspect ratio of 16.5. Figure 2(b) shows the cross-sectional TEM image after CF4 plasma treatment for 30 s. The depth dependence of the sidewall TiO2 /uniFB01 lm thickness before and after the CF4 plasma treatment and the etched amount are plotted in Fig. 3. The depth is de /uniFB01 ned as being from the top of the pristine pattern. The deposited TiO2 /uniFB01 lm thickness varies from 10.1 nm at a depth of 40 nm to 9.8 nm at a depth of 300 nm. The remaining TiO2 /uniFB01 lm thickness after the plasma treatment increased from 7.5 nm at 40 nm to 8.3 nm at 300 nm. The etched amount therefore decreased from 2.6 nm at 40 nm to 1.5 nm at 300 nm. Woo et al. showed the mechanism of the etching of TiO2 /uniFB01 lm with CF4 plasma. 26) They mentioned that the TiO2 /uniFB01 lm reacted with F radicals from the CF4 plasma because the Ti -F chemical bond is stronger than the Ti -O bond, and TiF x formed on the surface

Fig. 1. Etched amount of the blanket TiO2 as a function of the CF4 plasma treatment time (30 and 60 s).

as a byproduct. The TiF x was removed by ion bombardment. We believe that the amount of F radical decreased from the top of the pattern to the bottom because the radicals having diffused from the plasma were consumed on the sidewall. This caused the dependence of the etched amount on the pattern depth, or aspect ratio. Therefore, to suppress this dependence, we considered it important to supply the same amount of F radicals regardless of the aspect ratio, and one method would be to use the CF polymer formed on the TiO2 surface. We supposed the same amount of F radical could be provided from the CF polymer from top to bottom of the hole when etching with O2 plasma. In this study, we used C4F8 plasma to form the CF polymer.

## 3.2. Blanket TiO2 etching with cyclic C4F8 and O2 plasma

First, blanket TiO2 etching was carried out with cyclic C4F8 and O2 plasma processing. Figure 4 shows the cyclic number dependence of blanket TiO2 etching with cyclic C4F8 and O2 plasma. Both treatment times were 30 s. The etched amount increased linearly with the number of cycles. The TiO2 etched amount per cycle was 0.71 nm/cycle. We also con/uniFB01 rmed the O2 plasma did not etch the TiO2 /uniFB01 lm. This result supports that F radicals from the CF polymer etched TiO2. We next con /uniFB01 rm the dependence of the TiO2 etched amount on the CF polymer thickness. We /uniFB01 rst measured CF polymer thicknesses for different C4F8 plasma treatment times from cross-sectional SEM images. Figure 5 shows that the thickness increased linearly with the treatment time. We then measured the TiO2 etched amounts for the different CF polymer thicknesses. The TiO2 etched amounts were 0.74 and 0.80 nm when the CF polymer thicknesses were 13.6 and 27.6 nm, respectively. The O2 plasma treatment time was 30 s and there was one cycle. These results indicate that the TiO2 etched amount was constant even if the thickness of the CF polymer formed on the /uniFB01 lm surface was different. We next analyze cross-sectional images after taken each step to investigate whether TiO2 etching is constant regardless of the CF polymer thickness.

Figure 6 shows TEM images as the TiO2 was deposited [Fig. 6(a)], after C 4 F8 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(b)], and after O2 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(c)]. Both plasma treatment times were 30 s. The TiO2 thickness increased from 10.1 nm as TiO2 was deposited to 10.5 nm after C4F8 plasma treatment, and then decreased to 9.4 nm after O2 plasma treatment. This means that TiO2 was not etched by C4F8 plasma but etched by O2 plasma. The sample after C4F8 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(b)] shows that there was a modi /uniFB01 ed layer between the CF polymer and TiO2 surface. The modi /uniFB01 ed layer was removed with O2 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(c)]. Figure 7 shows the TEM images after C4F8 plasma treatment for 30 s [Fig. 7(a)] and 60 s [Fig. 7(b)]. The thickness of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer after 60 s was the same as that after 30 s although the CF polymer after 60 s was thicker than that after 30 s. This shows that the modi /uniFB01 ed layer thickness is constant regardless of the CF polymer thickness. We speculate that the TiO2 surface is modi /uniFB01 ed by CF radicals with ion bombardment and not with thermal energy from the stage. However, the thick CF polymer protects the surface from ions. Therefore, the modi /uniFB01 ed layer is kept constant, although the CF polymer thickness increases. As a result, the TiO2 etched amount is constant even if the CF polymer thickness changes. We then

carried out XPS analysis to investigate the TiO2 surface after removal of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer.

Figure 8 shows the narrow-scan spectra of (a) Ti, (b) F, and (c) C of both the pristine sample and sample after C4F8 plasma and O2 plasma treatment. The sample after these plasma treatments had a single peak at around 684 eV related

to F 1s, while the pristine sample did not [Fig. 8(b)]. This means that there was F residue on the surface after the plasma treatments. Figure 8(c) shows the spectrum of C 1s. Both samples had two peaks at 284.8 and 288.9 eV, which

correspond to C -C and O C -= O bonds, respectively. These peaks are considered to be due to surface impurities. This result supports the /uniFB01 nding that the F residue after the plasma treatments was not CF polymer. The spectrum of Ti 2p in the pristine sample had two peaks at 458.8 and 464.6 eV owing to the titanium atoms of TiO2 [Fig. 8(a)], and the spectrum after the plasma treatments had two peaks at 459.1 and 464.9 eV. These peaks were also due to TiO2 but they were slightly shifted to higher energy, which indicates Ti -F bonds on the surface. 26) The surface after the plasma treatments thus contained TiO2 and TiF . We speculate that the TiF x x is the residue of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer. We /uniFB01 nally conducted thermal desorption spectroscopy after each step to investigate the detail of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer.

Figure 9 shows ion currents for mass-to-charge ratios of 67, 86, 105, and 124, which respectively correspond to TiF, TiF2, TiF3, and TiF4. The spectroscopies of TiF and TiF3 had two peaks at 350 °C and 460 °C while TiF2 and TiF4 had a single peak at 350 °C. We believe that there were two types of titanium /uniFB02 uoride. One had a desorption peak at 350 °C and dissociated into TiF, TiF2, TiF3, and TiF4 in the mass spectrometer. The other had a peak at 450 °C and dissociated into TiF and TiF3 [Fig. 9(a)]. There were no peaks of these except for TiF in the sample after the O2 plasma treatment [Fig. 9(b)]. The TiF peak count was 1.78 × 10 -13 A having decreased from 1.00 × 10 -12 A after the C4F8 plasma treatment. These results show that the modi /uniFB01 ed layer that formed in the C4F8 plasma was titanium /uniFB02 uorides and most of it was etched away with O2 plasma. We /uniFB01 nally con /uniFB01 rm that the etched amount depends on the stage temperatures in the C4F8 plasma step and O2 plasma step.

Figure 10 shows the blanket TiO2 etched amount for different stage temperatures in each step. We /uniFB01 rst decreased the temperature of the C4F8 plasma step from 60 °C to 20 °C, while the O2 plasma step had a temperature of 60 °C. The etched amount per cycle in the C4F8 plasma step at 20 °C was 0.63 nm/cycle, which was almost same as that at 60 °C. We then decreased the temperature in the O2 plasma step from 60 °C to 20 °C, while the C4F8 plasma step had a temperature of 60 °C. The etched amount per cycle in the O2 plasma step at 20 °C was 0.24 nm/cycle, which was lower than that at 60 °C. These results show that the thickness of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer formed in the C4F8 plasma step does not depend on the temperature, while the etched amount of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer in the O2 plasma step does. This is consistent with the results of thermal desorption spectroscopy. However, the calculated vapor pressure of TiF4 at 60 °C was 0.14 Pa, 27) which was lower than the pressure of the O2 plasma of 13.3 Pa by a factor of 95. We therefore believe that the etching reaction is assisted by ion bombardment in the O2 plasma treatment.

On the basis of the above results, we suggest the TiO2 etching mechanism of the cyclic process shown in Fig. 11. First, the C4F8 plasma modi /uniFB01 es the surface of the TiO2 and formed TiF, TiF2, TiF3, and TiF4 [Fig. 11(a)]. The titanium /uniFB02 uorides remain on the surface because their vapor pressure is lower than the plasma pressure. The CF polymer therefore forms on the titanium /uniFB02 uorides [Fig. 11(b)]. Consequently, the CF polymer suppresses further modi /uniFB01 cation and formation of titanium /uniFB02 uorides. O radicals and ions in the O2 plasma remove the CF polymer and TiF2, TiF3, and TiF4 [Figs. 11(c), 11(d)]. TiF remains on the surface and changes to TiF x in the next C4F8 plasma step.

## 3.3. Cyclic C4F8 and O2 plasma etching of sidewall TiO2

This section reports on the application of the cyclic process to a sidewall TiO2 /uniFB01 lm on a line pattern.

First, we measured the pro /uniFB01 le of the /uniFB01 lm composition to study the surface state of the sidewall TiO2 /uniFB01 lm after the C4F8 plasma treatment. Figure 12(a) shows the TEM image of the pattern sample after C4F8 plasma treatment for 30 s.

Figures 12(b) and 12(c) shows the atomic percentages of C, F, Ti, and Si, which were obtained by EDX spectroscopy, at the upper and lower portions shown in Fig. 12(a), respectively. The horizontal axis shows the distance from the line pattern while the vertical axis shows the atomic percentage. The Ti increases from below 1% at 2 nm to above 20% at 8 nm as the Si decreases from above 25% to below 1% in both Figs. 12(b) and 12(c). We believe that the boundary between the SiO2 and TiO2 /uniFB01 lm was at about 5 nm. Meanwhile, the boundary between the TiO2 /uniFB01 lm and CF polymer is unclear in both the upper portion [Fig. 12(b)] and

In both portions, Ti decreased from above 20% at 20 nm to below 1% at 25 nm, C increased from below 3% at 15 nm to above 80% at 24 nm, and F was above 3% in the range from 14 to 22 nm. Therefore, there were Ti, C, and F in the range from 15 to 20 nm. This means that TiO2 /uniFB01 lm and CF polymer were mixed at the boundary

regardless of the depth. We believe from these results that the sidewall surface was modi /uniFB01 ed by C4F8 plasma treatment, the same as for the blanket surface.

Second, we etched the sidewall TiO2 /uniFB01 lm on a trench pattern with an aspect ratio of 46. Figure 13(a) shows the TEM image of the trench pattern sample as TiO2 was deposited. Figures 13(b) -13(d) shows enlargements of Fig. 13(a) at the top, a 1400 nm depth from the top, and the bottom, respectively. We used two O2 plasma treatment times in the cyclic process. One was 30 s and the other was 60 s. The C4F8 plasma treatment time and the number of cycles were held constant at 30 s and eight cycles, respectively. TEM images after the cyclic process with O2 plasma for 30 s are shown in Figs. 13(e) -13(g) while those for 60 s are shown in Figs. 13(h) -13(j). Figure 14 shows the thickness of sidewall TiO2 as deposited and after the cyclic processes. The etched amounts were 0.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.5, 3.1, and 4.2 nm at the top of the pattern, a depth of 700 nm from the top, a depth of 1400 nm, a depth of 2100 nm, a depth of 2800 nm, and the bottom, respectively. The sidewall TiO2 at the top was not etched and the average etched amount except at the top was 3.5 nm. The amount increased with an increase in the O2 plasma treatment time from 30 to 60 s. The etched amounts after 60 s were 2.9, 4.3, 4.2, 5.1, 4.3, and 4.0 nm, respectively; i.e. the top sidewall TiO2 was etched by 2.9 nm and the average etched amount except at the top was 4.4 nm. We believe that O2 plasma treatment for insuf /uniFB01 cient time cannot remove the CF polymer completely. The remaining CF polymer then prevents the modi /uniFB01 ed TiO2 from being removed. Consequently, the etched amount increases with the O2 plasma treatment time. Furthermore, the CF polymer

<!-- image -->

thickness at the top is greater than that of the sidewall in the trench as shown in Fig. 12(a), which results in a smaller amount of etching at the top.

## 4. Conclusions

Cycle etching of TiO2 was performed using C4F8 and O2 plasma. We con rmed /uniFB01 that C4F8 plasma formed a CF polymer layer on TiO2 and a modi /uniFB01 ed TiO2 layer under the CF polymer, and most of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer was removed by the following O2 plasma treatment. We believe that the modi /uniFB01 ed layer comprises several types of titanium /uniFB02 uoride, and they do not desorb from the surface in the C4F8 plasma step because of their low vapor pressure and the CF polymer formed on the modi /uniFB01 ed layer. In addition, the desorption

amount of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer in the O2 plasma step depends on the temperature, and we can thus control the etched amount per cycle using the temperature of the step. The cyclic process of these two steps successfully etched TiO2 and the etching amount increased in proportion to the number of cycles. The etch rate was 0.67 nm/cycle. We also con /uniFB01 rmed uniform sidewall etching of TiO2 /uniFB01 lm formed on a trench patterned sample with an aspect ratio of 46. We believe that the C4F8 and O2 plasma cyclic process is a promising way to etch a sidewall uniformly in futuregeneration 3D devices.
