Etching mechanism

As integrated circuit devices continue to shrink, achieving sub-3 nm technology nodes requires innovative 3D architectures along with the advent of advanced materials and processes. From an etching perspective, traditional reactive ion etching (RIE), which uses reactive ions and neutral species, becomes increasingly inadequate for atomic-scale dimensions due to surface damage from ion bombardment and the high surface-to-volume ratio. Atomic layer etching (ALE) presents a superior alternative, utilizing two complementary self-limiting steps. By alternating between surface modification and removal phases, ALE enables atomic-level control over etching, surpassing the limitations of traditional RIE methods. In this study, we utilized hexafluoroacetylacetone (Hhfac) and O radicals, generated by a hollow cathode plasma source, as the primary etching agents for various high-k including HfO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, and Y2O3 thin films. Our research focused on elucidating the adsorption dynamics of Hhfac, which contribute to significant volatilization upon interaction with O radicals, leading to self-limiting etching with atomic-scale precision. Detailed surface reactions, mass variations, and volatile etch byproducts were systematically analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in-situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and in-situ residual gas analyzer (RGA). These analyses provided both theoretical and experimental insights  into  the  etching  mechanisms.  This  work  presents  a  layer-by-layer  removal  method  for  various  highκ materials, enabling the creation of sharp interfaces and high aspect ratio patterns and contributes to a deeper understanding of etching pathways, particularly in the Å ngstrom era of device scaling. ¨

## 1. Introduction

As  the  dimensions  of  complementary  metal -oxide -semiconductor (CMOS)  devices  continue  to  shrink  with  advances  in  electronic manufacturing, it is expected that the technology node for modern logic devices will scale down to below 3 nm, enabling higher performance and increased transistor density [1]. This ongoing reduction in device dimensions has necessitated the adoption of new materials and processes compatible with advanced 3D nanodevice integration, such as gate-allaround (GAA) transistors, which feature high surface-to-volume ratios [2 -4]. Particularly, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high-k oxides such as HfO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, with their high dielectric constants (k), low electrical leakage, and excellent thermal stability, has been widely utilized as replacements for SiO2 in modern semiconductor devices for over 10 years [5]. More recently, there has been a need to precisely reduce the  thickness  of  high-k  oxides  while  preserving  the  crystallinity  that emerges  beyond  a  certain  thickness,  driven  by  performance  and

geometric limitations. Additionally, achieving precise etching profiles of high-k oxides without footing issues has led to their consideration as potential  hard  mask  materials  in  next-generation  EUV  lithography, enabling accurate pattern transfer with vertical sidewalls [6].

In this context, precise etching techniques are essential to remove such high-k materials with atomic-scale fidelity while avoiding overetching  and  preventing  damage  to  underlying  substrates,  crucial  for meeting the stringent demands of device performance in complex 3D semiconductor  architectures  [7 -9].  Traditional  reactive  ion  etching (RIE),  which  relies  on  the  exposure  of  chemically  reactive  ions  and neutral  species,  has  long  been  the  foundational  etching  technology [10,11].  However,  as  the  critical  dimensions  and  profiles  approach atomic-scale  levels, particularly within  extremely  downscaled  3D structures,  such  conventional  RIE  method  has  become  increasingly inadequate for satisfying the demanding requirements of plasma etching [12].  Furthermore,  miniaturized  and  thinner  device  structures  are highly  vulnerable  to  surface  damage  from  ion  bombardment  during

plasma etching, which can lead to performance degradation, increased variability, and reduced reliability [12].

Accordingly,  compared  to  the  RIE  process,  atomic  layer  etching (ALE)  has  emerged  as  a  self-limited  technique  designed  to  achieve monolayer-level precision in material removal [12,13]. Each ALE cycle consists of two distinct reactions. The first reaction, known as the surface modification step, involves the interaction of incoming chemical species, such as precursors or activated radicals, with the underlying substrate, resulting in the formation of a chemically modified layer [10]. This  modified  layer  reduces  the  threshold  energy  required  for  its removal and prevents unintended etching of the underlying material. The second reaction involves ion bombardment, where moderate-energy ions provide sufficient kinetic energy to selectively remove the chemically modified layer [10,13]. This removal step ensures precise elimination  of  the  modified  layer  while  protecting  non-targeted  areas, enabling outstanding etch selectivity, layer-by-layer etching, and minimal damage to the material beneath.

In the first step of chemical modification, thermal adsorption can be utilized  in  lieu  of  plasma  modification,  enabling  the  formation  of  a modified layer with greater atomic-scale fidelity. This method offers a more precise and controlled  modification  compared  to  plasma-based techniques, ensuring better consistency and minimizing damage to the underlying  material.  This  thermal  adsorption  method  is  particularly advantageous when combined with diketones, which have been studied as one of effective precursors for ALE of metal or metal oxide films due to their exceptional reactivity and strong affinity for metals [14 -17]. These diketones feature two oxygen atoms capable of simultaneously binding to a single metal center, forming stable chelate complexes. The tunable nature  of  diketones  allows  for  modifications  to  the  ligand  groups, impacting steric effects, acidity, and volatility, thereby enabling tailored etch rates and selectivity [17]. When used in ALE of metal or metal oxides  with  diketonates,  the  ALE  process  typically  begins  with  an oxidation or chlorination step to elevate the metal to a higher oxidation state. This is followed by the chelation step, where diketones, such as hexafluoroacetylacetone (Hhfac) and acetylacetone (Hacac), form volatile  metal -ligand complexes [15 -19]. However, while diketones are well-known for their remarkable coordination capabilities, their use in ALE  for  metal  oxides  has  been  primarily  limited  to  those  with + 2 oxidation states, such as ZnO and CoO. This limitation arises from the steric  hindrance  associated with  higher  oxidation states,  which complicates the formation of stable, volatile chelate complexes. Specifically, the requirement for three or four acac or hfac ligands to induce volatility is  hindered  by  spatial  constraints,  making  it  difficult  to  form  stable complexes with high-valency metals. As a result, no prior studies have specifically explored ALE for high-k thin films such as HfO2  and ZrO2, which exhibit 4 + oxidation states (i.e., Hf 4 + ,  Zr 4 + ) and present additional challenges in forming volatile complexes. Indeed, previous ALE studies on ZnO films using Hacac and O2  plasma demonstrated exceptional selectivity against Al2O3  (~8:1) and SiO2/HfO2  (~80:1), highlighting the inefficiency of diketone-based volatilization for these oxides [17]. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the exact etch byproducts  and  underlying  etching  mechanisms  remains  yet  to  be explored. Furthermore, although several attempts have been made to utilize  theoretical  calculations  and  modeling  to  elucidate  reaction mechanisms at the atomic-scale processing, [20 -22] a comprehensive understanding  of  the  exact  etch  by-products  and  underlying  etching mechanisms remains yet to be explored.

In this study, therefore, we introduce the use of Hhfac molecules as a diketonate precursor to chemically induce the formation of a surfacemodified layer on various high-k dielectric materials, including HfO2, ZrO2,  Al2O3 and  Y2O3 films.  To  optimize  the  volatilization  of  the modified layer in the subsequent step of the ALE process, we employed a remote hollow cathode plasma (HCP) source, which generates neutral oxygen radicals. Compared to direct capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) sources, this remote plasma configuration provides higher radical densities while minimizing plasma-induced damage to the substrate. This study  systematically  investigates  the  ALE  characteristics  and  fundamental aspects of the proposed ALE chemistry, primarily focusing on the temperature-dependent adsorption dynamics of Hhfac molecules, which pertain to their crucial role in volatilization upon exposure to subsequent O radicals, especially for high-k oxides with 4 + oxidation states. To uncover the detailed molecular interactions and mechanistic pathways,  a  combination  of  techniques  was  employed,  including  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition analysis, insitu quartz  crystal  microbalance  (QCM)  for  real-time  mass  variation monitoring, and residual gas analysis (RGA) for identifying volatile etch byproducts. By advancing our understanding of the ALE mechanism for high-k materials, these findings pave the way for the practical integration of ALE into semiconductor manufacturing, enabling precise etching of high-k oxide films such as HfO2 and ZrO2.

## 2. Experimental details

## 2.1. ALE process

In  this  study,  the  ALE  process  was  performed  using  a  4-inch traveling-wave type ALE reactor (Atomic Classic, CN-1 Co.) equipped with a hollow cathode plasma (HCP) system (Series 50, Meaglow Ltd.). The HCP source, operating at a 13.56 MHz radio frequency (RF), was positioned approximately 10 cm above the substrate. One ALE cycle consists of  sequential exposure of 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedione (Hhfac) (98 + %, Alfa Aesar) precursor and oxygen radicals. The Hhfac  precursor  was  stored  in  a  room-temperature  stainless  steel canister and delivered at 0.3 Torr via a metering valve. To remove any excess molecules and etching by-products, a 30-second purge with highpurity N2  (99.999%) was carried out between each pulse. A parallel plate capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) reactor (Nexusbe Co., Ltd.) was employed to evaluate etching performance.

## 2.2. Substrate preparation

For  the  ALE  experiments,  HfO2,  ZrO2,  Y2O3  and  Al2O3  thin  films deposited by ALD methods on a Si substrate. HfO2, ZrO2 and Y2O3 ALD processes were conducted at a deposition temperature of 320  C using ◦ cyclopentadienyl tris(dimethylamino)hafnium [CpHf(NMe2)3] (iChems Co., Ltd.), cyclopentadienyl tris(dimethylamino)zirconium [CpZr (NMe2)3]  (iChems  Co.,  Ltd.),  and  (RCp)2Y(iPr-amd)  (IYA02,  iChems Co.), respectively, with ozone (O3, 220 g/m ) as the co-reactant. The 3 Al2O3  ALD process involved the use of trimethylaluminum [Al(CH3)3] (iChems Co., Ltd.) as the precursor, with H2O as the co-reactant at 150 ◦ C. Si substrates, 23 nm thick SiO2 grown thermally, and 32 nm thick SiN fabricated using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) were separately prepared as references for etching.

## 2.3. Analytical methods

The etched thickness of the films was characterized using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (MG-1000, Nano View Co.) with a spectral range of 380 -900 nm at a 70 ◦ fixed incidence light angle. The layer density of the films was  estimated  by  energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) (ARL Quant X, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.). The film surface ' morphology  was  analyzed  using  an  atomic  force  microscope  (AFM) (Park XE-100) with a scan size of 5 x 5 μ m 2 , and the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness values were extracted from the standard deviation of the height values in the AFM images. The elemental composition and chemical binding structures of various surfaces were analyzed by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS) (K-alpha plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.) with an Al K α X-ray source of 1486.6 eV,  using  the  C  1  s  (C-C  bonding,  284.5  eV)  peak  as  a  reference  to calibrate the measured core levels. The built-in quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) (SQM-160, Inficon) with a 6 MHz quartz crystal (285  C ◦ optimized  crystals,  14  mm  gold),  positioned  at  a  typical  substrate

location and at almost the same azimuthal angle as that of the substrate, was used to determine the mass change per cycle during the ALE process. To identify a plausible etching reaction mechanism, in-situ mass spectrometry measurements were conducted using a residual gas analyzer (RGA-200, Stanford Research Systems) in the range of 1 to 200 amu with a mass resolution of 1 amu. The ionization energy of the RGA was fixed at 70 eV. Prior to etch measurements, the RGA was calibrated using Ar, CO,  CO2,  H2,  and  H2O  to  ensure  accurate  quantification  of  gas components.

## 3. Results and discussion

± 0.07, 0.82 ± 0.13, and 1.20 ± 0.20 Å/cycle. The EPC values for Y2O3 increased steadily from 0.21 ± 0.05 Å/cycle at 350  C to 0.93 ◦ ± 0.20 Å/ cycle at 400 ◦ C, while SiO2  and SiN films exhibited almost negligible etching  behavior  (see  Fig.  S1  in  Supplementary  Information).  These temperature-dependent etching behaviors are summarized in Table S1, which presents the detailed EPC values for HfO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, and Y2O3 across the temperature range of 100 -400  C under a constant RF bias ◦ power of 200  W. The prominent increase in EPC with rising substrate temperature can be attributed to the thermally activated nature of the modification and desorption reactions.

Fig. 1a illustrates the four principal repetitive steps of the ALE process:  the  Hhfac-induced surface  modification step and the  O radicalinduced  removal  step  via  oxidative  bond  cleavage,  separated  by  N2 purging steps that effectively remove undesired etching residues and prevent cross-contamination. Fig. 1b schematically illustrates the overall etching mechanism. Initially, Hhfac molecules adsorb onto the high-k oxide surface, where dissociative chemisorption results in the formation of  fluorinated  surface  species  such  as  CFx and  OCFx.  These  species chemically passivate and modify the topmost layer, thereby lowering its binding energy. In the subsequent step, oxygen radicals generated from the HCP source react with the modified surface. These radicals induce a series of oxidation reactions that cleave molecular bonds, forming volatile  compounds  such  as  Hf -CFx  and  Hf -OCFx.  This  process  enables chemical fragmentation and volatilization of surface species, rather than physical  desorption  of  intact  layers.  The  layer-by-layer  removal  is corroborated by in-situ QCM measurements of mass variation and RGA analysis of volatile byproducts.

As depicted in Fig. 2a, the ALE process was conducted for 100 cycles, with each cycle consisting of a 5 s Hhfac pulse, a 30 s N2 purge, a 15 s O radical pulse, and another 30 s N2  purge, applied under a 200 W bias power. Substrate temperatures ranging from 100 to 400  C were used to ◦ evaluate the etch per cycle (EPC) of HfO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, Y2O3, Si, SiO2, and SiN films. The EPC values for HfO2  (black circles in Fig. 2) were estimated to be 0.01 ± 0.01, 0.03 ± 0.01, 0.12 ± 0.07, 0.24 ± 0.06, 0.59 ± 0.11, 0.67 ± 0.08, and 0.81 ± 0.16 Å/cycle at substrate temperatures of 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 ◦ C, respectively. Similarly, ZrO2  (red circles in Fig. 2) exhibited EPC values of 0.04 ± 0.02, 0.08 ± 0.02, 0.25 ± 0.06, 0.66 ± 0.10, 0.84 ± 0.09, 0.93 ± 0.09, and  1.33 ± 0.12  Å/cycle  over  the  same  temperature  range.  Under identical temperature conditions, Al2O3  (blue circles in Fig. 2) showed EPC values of 0.04 ± 0.01, 0.06 ± 0.04, 0.21 ± 0.08, 0.35 ± 0.05, 0.69

Fig. 2b-d illustrate the EPCs for HfO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, which were obtained by varying the bias power and injection time of the etchant sources over 100 ALE cycles at 300  C. Fig. 2b shows that ALE is highly ◦ dependent on the energy and flux of O radicals, which can be controlled through substrate biasing. At bias power below 150 W, referred to as the incomplete  etch  regime,  the  EPC  for  all  samples  increased  with increasing bias power. Once the bias power exceeded 150 W within the ALE window, O radicals above the desorption threshold facilitated the complete removal of the modified layer. The physical sputtering region, including Y2O3, Si, SiO2, and SiN films, was not observed up to a bias power of 500 W, as reported in Fig. S1. Table S2 summarizes the detailed EPC values for the same oxide materials as a function of RF bias power (0 -300  W) at a fixed temperature of 300  C, providing insight into RF ◦ power-dependent etch characteristics. The saturated EPC values were found to be 0.57 Å/cycle for HfO2, 0.85 Å/cycle for ZrO2, and 0.68 Å/ cycle for Al2O3, with respective Hhfac and O radical feeding times of 1 s/ 8 s, 1 s/7 s, and 1 s/6 s, demonstrating the self-limiting nature of the ALE process, as shown in Fig. 2c and 2d. The EPC values measured by EDXRF were 0.058 μ g/(cm 2 ⋅ cycle) for HfO2 and 0.044 μ g/(cm 2 ⋅ cycle) for ZrO2 over 300 ALE cycles, as detailed in Fig. S2. The AFM-derived RMS surface roughness images and line scans of the HfO2 film before and after etching are shown in Fig. S3. During 50 cycles of ALE, which removed 2.76 nm of HfO2, the RMS roughness decreased from 0.634 nm to 0.547 nm, resulting in a smoother surface.

Fig.  3a  demonstrates  the  examination  of  the  synergistic  etching mechanism for Hhfac and oxygen sources through three approaches: Hhfac-only dosing, cyclic dosing of Hhfac with O2 gas, and cyclic dosing of Hhfac with O radicals, each yielding distinct trends in film thickness evolution. Mohimi et al. previously reported that copper oxide reacts with  Hhfac  to  yield  volatile  Cu(hfac)2;[16]  however,  in  our  results, merely injecting Hhfac on all samples did not result in any thickness changes. This observation confirms the fundamentally different surface

reactivity of HfO2  and ZrO2  compared to CuO, as their highly coordinated, dense oxide lattices restrict access of bulky Hhfac ligands to the metal centers, thereby rendering the cooperative coordination required for  highly  volatile  metal-hfac  complexes,  such  as  Hf(hfac)4 and  Zr (hfac)4,  both  sterically  hindered  and  thermodynamically  unfavorable [23 25]. Moreover, film thicknesses remained constant under consec--utive  pulses  of  Hhfac  and  O2 gas,  establishing  that  O2 gas  alone  is insufficient to remove the Hhfac-modified surface layer. Remarkably, the consistent thickness decrease observed when Hhfac and O radicals are  sequentially  combined  highlights  that  radical-driven  chemical removal is essentially required for an effective ALE process.

In-situ QCM experiments were conducted to further investigate the synergistic etching effect by successively dosing Hhfac with O2 gas or O radicals. Fig. 3b illustrates the mass change per cycle for real-time QCM measurements during 12 cycles of repeated Hhfac and O2  gas dosing, followed by 40 ALE cycles on HfO2 at a substrate temperature of 300  C. ◦ The first 12 cycles using O2 gas showed no significant mass loss, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3a. For the following 40 cycles of Hhfac and O radical dosing, a mass gain of approximately 10 ng/cm 2 per cycle was observed after Hhfac dosing, attributed to the passivation effect  from  the  adsorption  of  Hhfac  molecules  onto  the  surface. Following the O radical pulse, a cumulative mass loss of about 60 ng/ cm 2 per  cycle  was  observed,  corresponding  to  the  radical-driven removal of the modified HfO2 layer. The QCM measurements revealed a mass gain of only ~ 10 ng/cm 2 per Hhfac pulse, quantitatively confirming the steric hindrance phenomenon hypothesized in our etching mechanism and demonstrating restricted surface coverage of Hhfac ligands.  Based  on  its  molecular  weight  (~616  g/mol)  and  crystallographic footprint (100 -130 Å 2 per molecule) [23], a densely packed monolayer would correspond to approximately 80 -100 ng/cm 2 .  This notable discrepancy is primarily attributed to dissociative adsorption at 300  C, where Hhfac molecules decompose upon surface contact rather ◦ than adsorbing intact. Although steric hindrance around Hf(IV) centers limits molecular adsorption, the dominant factor is temperature-driven dissociation, resulting in a surface terminated by smaller CFx and OCFx fragments. This analysis supports our overall etch mechanism, which proposes  a  transition  from  molecular  to  dissociative  adsorption  as  a function of temperature, essential for achieving effective etching during subsequent O radical exposure.

Next, the surface modification of HfO2 was examined using AR-XPS

measurements before and after 60 s of Hhfac exposure at 100 ◦ C and 300  C, following 60 s of O radical pre-clean. Fig. 4a ◦ -d present highresolution Hf 4f, O 1 s, C 1 s, and F 1 s spectra acquired at an emission angle of 80 ◦ with respect to the sample normal. Fig. 4a shows the deconvolution of the Hf 4f spectrum, revealing two peaks corresponding to Hf 4f7/2  and Hf 4f5/2, located at 16.8 eV and 18.4 eV, respectively, which are characteristic of Hf -O bonds [26]. Compared to pure HfO2, the  Hhfac-treated  samples  exhibit  an  increase  in  binding  energy  of approximately 0.1 eV for both the Hf 4f7/2 and Hf 4f5/2 peaks. This shift might be associated with the formation of a modified fluorocarbon layer on the HfO2  surface or the partial passivation of oxygen vacancies by incorporated  fluorine  atoms  [27].  The  O  1  s  core-level  spectrum  in Fig. 4b was deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.2 eV, 532.1 eV, and 532.0 eV, corresponding to lattice oxygen (Hf -O bonding), non-lattice oxygen (O O bonding), and a combination of ester or carboxylic and -fluorinated carbonyl groups (O -C, O = C, and O CFx  bonding), respec--tively [28,29]. Upon exposure to Hhfac molecules at 300 ◦ C, the proportion of fluorinated carbonyl bonds increased to 26.22%, attributed to the  surface  adsorption  of  hfac  ligands  ( i.e. ,  associative  adsorption  in monodentate, bidentate, and chelate forms, as illustrated in Fig. S4 in the Supporting Information) [30].

Unlike the Hf 4f and O 1 s spectra, which exhibited no significant changes in peak positions or intensities after Hhfac exposure, the C 1 s and  F  1  s  spectra  showed  distinct  spectral  variations,  reflecting  the formation  of  fluorinated  carbon  species.  The  C  1  s  spectrum  was deconvoluted into five distinct peaks: 284.5 eV, assigned to aliphatic carbon (C -C) [31]; 287.8 eV, corresponding to C -O, C = O, and O CFx -bonds [32]; 88.7 eV, attributed to the -CF bond [33]; 291.0 eV, associated with the  CF2 bond [34]; and 295.0 eV, assigned to the  CF3 bond, --as displayed in Fig. 4c [35]. Similarly, the F 1 s spectrum in Fig. 4d exhibited five deconvoluted peaks: Hf -OFx at 685.5 eV,  CF at 688.5 eV, --CF2 at 689.0 eV, and  CF3 at 691.0 eV [36 --38]. In comparison with the C 1 s and F 1 s spectra at 100  C, the emergence of several CFx ◦ -related surface moieties at 300 ◦ C, suggests that thermal modification at the elevated  temperature  facilitates  the  dissociative  adsorption  of  Hhfac molecules [39]. This dissociative adsorption leads to the formation of CFx species on the surface, which contribute to the formation of volatile etching products upon exposure to subsequent oxygen radicals, rather than  being  removed  through  the  formation  of  volatile  Hf(hfac)4 complexes.

The atomic composition after 60 s of Hhfac ◦ exposure was obtained from the XPS spectra of the same samples shown in Fig. 4a -d, while the data for 30 cycles of ALE was derived from the XPS spectra in Fig. S5. For all samples, the atomic C content remains above 10% due to adventitious C contamination from the ex-situ nature of the XPS measurement. Upon exposure to Hhfac at 100  C, the atomic ◦

composition reveals that C constitutes 23.4% and F accounts for 4.1%, primarily attributed to the molecular adsorption of Hhfac without significant  decomposition.  As  the  temperature  increases,  the  thermal decomposition of Hhfac may lead to a relatively higher accumulation of residual C and F species on the surface, reaching atomic percentages of 42.6% and 9.6%, respectively, at 300  C. For the ALE samples at 100  C, ◦ ◦ no significant difference in the residual C and F contents was observed

compared to the Hhfac exposure-only samples. This might be attributed to  the  minimal  etching  observed  in  Fig.  2a,  suggesting  that  at  low temperatures, only limited chemisorption of Hhfac molecules occurs. Alternatively, the incorporation of persistent C and F species likely results from the continuous ALE process. In contrast, for the ALE samples at  300 ◦ C, a substantial reduction in C and F contents was observed compared to the Hhfac exposure-only samples. This reduction is likely due to the efficient dissociative adsorption of Hhfac molecules at the higher  temperature,  coupled  with  the  formation  of  volatile  etching byproducts  through  interaction  with  O  radicals.  Nevertheless,  the presence of persistent C and F components at levels similar to those observed at 100  C was still detected. ◦

To investigate the dissociated ion species during each temporal reaction, in-situ residual gas analyzer (RGA) measurements were utilized, as shown in Fig. 5. The RGA cracking patterns of Hhfac exposure at stage temperatures  between  100 ◦ C  and  300 ◦ C  are  displayed  in  Fig.  5a, showing mass-to-charge ratios ( m z / ) from 1 to 100 amu, while Fig. 5b focuses on the 100 to 200 m z / range. Notable signals were detected at 20, 28, 31, 47, 50, 69, 119, and 139 m z / , corresponding to HF + , CO + , CF , OCF + + ,  CF2 ,  CF3 + + ,  [hfac-CF3-HF] + ,  and [hfac-CF3] + ,  respectively. The formation of HF + and [hfac-CF3-HF] + is  proposed  to  arise  from intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between O -H and F C -groups, which act to stabilize the intermediates during the reaction [40]. CF + and CF2 + species are presumed to result from the homolytic cleavage of CF3 as fluorine atoms are transferred to the substrate.

With increasing stage temperatures, the ion intensities for CF + , CF2 , + and CF3 + peaks increase, as also observed in Fig. S6, whereas the signals for [hfac-CF3-HF] + and [hfac-CF3] + progressively diminish and eventually vanish due to the heat-induced decomposition of Hhfac. Annealing  to  temperatures  exceeding  300 ◦ C  causes  the  Hhfac  moiety  to completely decompose, leaving surface-bound species containing fluoroalkyl ether groups, which contribute to the etching process. The proposed mechanism  likely involves the chemisorption and partial decomposition of Hhfac molecules on the oxide surface, leading to the incorporation of ligand-derived fluorine into the outermost layer [41]. This fluorinated surface layer represents an essential intermediate phase in the etching sequence. Subsequent exposure to oxidative species initiates  the  breakdown  of  this  modified  layer,  facilitating  material removal in a controlled and self-limiting manner.

Fig. 5c and 5d depict the RGA mass spectrum and the time-resolved ion intensity profiles showing etch products recorded over 60   s of O radical interaction with Hhfac-coated HfO2 at 300  C, respectively. After ◦ 500 cycles of ALD HfO2, the Hhfac exposure was maintained for 10  min at 300 ◦ C to enhance adsorption efficiency and strengthen RGA signal amplitude. The absence of signals aside from O + and O2 + ions during O2 gas utilization implies that O2  gas lacks the capability to energetically remove the polymerized layer on the material surface. On the other hand, the significant m z / at 18, 20, 28, 31, 44, and 47 are assigned to H2O , HF + + , CO + , CF + , CO2 , and OCF + + , respectively. Considering these main ion signals and Langmuir -Hinshelwood kinetics, the addition of

oxygen radicals leads to the formation of volatile byproducts, including Hf-Fx, Hf-CFx, Hf-OCFx, CO, CO2, and H2O, through chemical sputtering between oxygen radicals and the less-volatile modified layer [42]. Fluorocarbonated surfaces serve as active sites for this radical-stimulated combustion reaction. The RGA used in this study, with a measurable range  limited  to  1 -200  amu,  cannot  directly  identify  high-mass  Hfmediated fluoroalkyl compounds; for instance, Hf-CF, Hf-OCF2, and HfCF3, which have m z / values around 209, 244, and 247, respectively. Therefore, these compounds are instead tracked indirectly via CFx  or OCFx  fragments. The systematic increase in these fragment intensities ( m z / 20, 28, 31, 44, and 47) specifically observed during O radical injection supports the formation of volatile Hf-containing etch byproducts during the ALE process.

To further elucidate the proposed etching mechanism, we performed an ALE process using a CCP system, where both Hhfac and O2 sources were directly ionized. Fig. 6 presents the thickness evolution of the HfO2 film as a function of ALE cycles under repeated exposures to Hhfac gas/ O2 plasma and Hhfac plasma/O2 plasma for up to 50 cycles at 100  C. ◦ Notably, a consistent thickness reduction with an EPC of 1.49 Å/cycle was observed even at 100  C, demonstrating a sustained etching effect as ◦ the number of ALE cycles increased to 50. This observation clearly indicates  that  the  decomposed  adsorption  of  Hhfac  molecules  during exposure is essential for effective etching. To reiterate the adsorption mechanism as illustrated in Fig. S7, thus, the gaseous Hhfac molecules are subject to bind to the surface in monodentate, bidentate, and chelate forms without any significant thermal decomposition at low temperatures. During the subsequent O radical pulse, these chemisorbed fluoroketone moieties are not effectively removed through the formation of volatile  Hf-fluoroketone  complexes,  resulting  in  negligible  etching. However, elevating the substrate temperatures or turning on plasma can trigger  decomposition  of  Hhfac  ligands,  promoting  the  dissociative adsorption of fluorine-related Fx, CFx  and OCFx  groups. These dissociated species can undergo through the following oxidative destruction with O radicals, leading to the synergistic etching in the various form of volatile products such as Hf-CF, Hf-OCF2, and Hf-CF3.

Therefore, it is worthy to note that the etching behavior of high-k oxides  with  4 + oxidation  states  such  as  HfO2 is  fundamentally  governed  by  the  temperature-dependent  adsorption  modes  of  the  Hhfac precursor.  Specifically,  while  chemisorption  alone  is  insufficient  for etching, dissociative adsorption plays a crucial role in facilitating the formation of volatile etch products, overcoming the inherent difficulty in  volatilizing  high-valency  metal  oxides.  By  systematically  investigating this mechanism through a combination of experimental results and both ex-situ and in-situ spectroscopic analyses, we have established an ALE strategy that enables the effective etching of materials with 4 + oxidation states, a challenge that has remained unresolved in conventional  Hacac-  or  Hhfac-based  processes.  This  advancement  not  only provides critical insights into the etching chemistry of high-k materials but also lays the groundwork for integrating ALE into next-generation semiconductor  manufacturing.  Given  the  increasing  complexity  of future device architectures, our findings offer a promising solution for atomic-level control in advanced patterning and material engineering.

## 4. Conclusions

We have successfully developed an ALE method effective for various high-k dielectrics, including HfO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, and Y2O3  films, using Hhfac in sequential combination with the Hhfac molecules and O radicals. The ALE process exhibited temperature-dependent etching behaviors,  yielding  the  EPC  values of  0.59 Å/cycle,  0.84 Å/cycle, 0.69 Å/ cycle, and 0.05 Å/cycle for HfO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, and Y2O3, respectively, within  the  optimal  ALE  bias  power  window  at  300 ◦ C.  In  contrast, negligible etching was observed for Si, SiO2, and SiN films under the same conditions. Surface roughness measurements confirmed a significant improvement in film smoothness after etching, demonstrating the capability of ALE for precise, atomic-scale material removal. Through

various spectroscopic analyses, we identified that thermal dissociation during Hhfac adsorption plays a key role in enabling an efficient ALE process. At lower temperatures, chemisorption is the dominant adsorption  mode,  while  at  elevated  temperatures,  it  transitions  to dissociative  adsorption.  Subsequently,  oxygen  radicals  interact  with fluoro-ether  fragments  generated  from  the  dissociative  adsorption  of Hhfac  molecules,  facilitating  the  release  of  volatile  Hf-fluoroketone complexes.  The  current  ALE  work  demonstrates  significant  efficacy, particularly  in  the  precise  etching  of  high-k  dielectrics  with  high oxidation  states, overcoming  challenges  typically  associated  with Hacac- or Hhfac-based processes. These findings provide a comprehensive  understanding  of  the  chemical  and  mechanistic  aspects  of  ALE, laying a solid foundation for future advancements in nanoscale device fabrication and semiconductor integration.
