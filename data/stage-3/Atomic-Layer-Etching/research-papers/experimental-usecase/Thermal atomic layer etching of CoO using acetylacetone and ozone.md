Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of CoO was demonstrated using sequential exposures of acetylacetone (Hacac) and ozone (O3). During the surface reactions, Hacac can remove CoO according to: CoO + 2Hacac → Co(acac)2 + H2O. Ozone was employed to eliminate carbon residue resulting from Hacac adsorption. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry observed a linear decrease in CoO film thickness versus Hacac and O3 exposures with an etch rate of 0.43 Å/cycle at 250  C. The surface of the CoO film was also observed to undergo changes in oxidation state and crystal structure with ◦ each reactant exposure. Ex situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) studies revealed that the initial h-CoO thin films were oxidized to c-Co3O4  by O3. Subsequently, the GIXRD analysis showed that the c-Co3O4  thin films were reduced to c-CoO by Hacac. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations confirmed the oxidation state of the various cobalt oxides. Quadrupole mass spectrometry measurements observed Co(acac)2 etch products during Hacac exposures on Co3O4 and CoO powder. Atomic force microscopy measurements also monitored a reduction in surface roughness during CoO ALE. These studies reveal that alternating changes in oxidation state and crystal structure occur during the sequential Hacac and O3 exposures that define CoO thermal ALE.

## 1. Introduction

Cobalt oxide is an industrially important material with applications in catalysis [1,2], water oxidation [3], Li-ion batteries [4,5], and gassensing  [6].  Cobalt  is  also  a  potential  next-generation  interconnect material and cobalt oxide may provide a pathway for cobalt etching during semiconductor processing [7,8]. Cobalt is known to have two stable oxides: Co(II) oxide (CoO) and the mixed valence Co(II, III) oxide (Co3O4) [9]. CoO typically crystallizes in a rocksalt-type cubic structure (c-CoO).  However,  metastable  wurtzite-type  hexagonal  CoO  (h-CoO) can  be  synthesized  and  stabilized  at  ambient  conditions  [10,11].  In comparison, Co3O4 is usually found in a spinel cubic structure (c-Co3O4).

volatile release reactions [15 -18]. During thermal ALE that produces isotropic etching, the volatile release reaction is typically a thermal reaction involving ligand exchange or ligand addition [17]. During plasma ALE that produces anisotropic etching, the volatile release reaction involves sputtering by energetic ions or neutral species [18].

Many useful properties of thin films can be tuned by precisely controlling  the  film  thickness  and  morphology  [12 -14].  Atomic  layer etching (ALE) is an etching technique that provides precise, atomic level removal of a thin film using alternating self-limiting reactions [15 -18]. ALE is usually accomplished with sequential surface modification and

Thermal ALE has been demonstrated for a variety of metal oxides [19 26], metal nitrides [27 --29], and elemental metals [30 -34]. Various semiconductor  materials  have  also  been  etched  using  thermal  ALE methods such as Si [35], Si3N4  [36], and SixGe1-x  [37]. Many of these thermal ALE processes have involved fluorination for surface modification and ligand exchange for volatile release [17,20,21]. In addition, oxidation and conversion reactions are often used together with fluorination and ligand exchange to define thermal ALE processes [30,35,38].

The first row transition metals are more difficult to etch using the ligand-exchange mechanism for volatile release. Besides acetylacetonate (acac) and cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands, there are not many ligands that will form volatile products during ligand exchange for the first row

transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu. Consequently, other etching mechanisms have been utilized such as halogenation or oxidation to change the oxidation state, and then ligand addition or ligand substitution with hydrogen transfer to volatilize the surface layer. Chlorination and ligand addition have been employed for the thermal ALE of Ni and  Co  [33,34].  Chlorination  and  ligand  substitution  with  hydrogen transfer have also been developed for the thermal ALE of Co and Fe [31,39,40]. Oxidation and ligand substitution with hydrogen transfer have also been demonstrated for the ALE of Co [41], Cu [32], and a variety of other metals [42].

(GIXRD)  was  employed  to  determine  the  crystalline  structure  of  the various cobalt oxide films after the Hacac and O3 reactions. XRD studies were also conducted on Co3O4  and CoO powders to monitor possible Hacac reduction reactions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the oxidation state of the various cobalt oxide films. Quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) was also employed to measure the etch products during the Hacac and O3  reactions. These combined SE, XRD, XPS and QMS investigations were able to reveal the intricacies of  sequential  thermal  ALE  reactions  when  the  oxidation  states  and crystal structures can change with each reactant exposure.

Previous work has also concentrated on the thermal ALE of first row transition  metal  oxides  using  chlorination  and  ligand  addition.  The thermal ALE of CoO, ZnO, Fe2O3  and NiO, has been developed using sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) for chlorination and N,N,N ,N -tetramethy-' ' lethylenediamine (TMEDA) for ligand addition [43]. The spontaneous etching  of  metal  oxides  has  also  been  demonstrated  using  hexafluoroacetylacetone  (Hhfac)  and  acetylacetone  (Hacac).  Hhfac  and Hacac can undergo ligand substitution and hydrogen transfer with a variety of metal oxides to form volatile metal hfac or metal acac complexes [44 -48]. In addition, the acidic proton of Hhfac and Hacac can transfer to the metal oxide to form H2O.

One advantage of Hhfac over Hacac is that Hhfac has a lower pKa value [49,50]. Hhfac can generally form more stable and volatile cobalt complexes than Hacac [51]. However, despite forming less stable metal complexes, Hacac is more attractive as a halogen-free option for semiconductor processing. Hacac avoids potential problems with fluorine surface  contamination  and  device  performance  degradation  that  can originate from fluorine in Hhfac.

In this study, thermal ALE of CoO was demonstrated using Hacac and O3 as the reactants. Based on the sequential reactions shown in Fig. 1, Hacac can etch CoO according to the ligand substitution with hydrogen transfer reaction: CoO + 2Hacac → Co(acac)2 + H2O. Hacac has also been  proposed  to  decompose  on  some  metal  oxides  and  block  the spontaneous etching of the metal oxide [52]. To clean the metal oxide surface, O3  was employed in this investigation to remove the carboncontaining species after the Hacac exposure. There is also the possibility that CoO can be oxidized to Co3O4  by the O3  exposures. Hacac exposures  may  then  be  able  to  reduce  the  Co3O4  back  to  CoO  by  the combustion of Hacac.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Reactor, spectroscopic ellipsometry and precursors

The CoO thin films were etched in a warm wall, hot-stage type ALE reactor.  A  detailed  description  of  this  apparatus  has  been  given  in  a previous publication [35]. The walls of the reactor were kept at 160  C ◦ for all experiments. The sample holder was heated to achieve the desired sample temperature. The experiments were conducted at sample temperatures of 200, 250 and 275  C. These temperatures are higher than ◦ the reported melting points for Co(acac)2 and Co(acac)3 of 168 -171  C ◦ and 195 205  C, respectively [53]. The sample was held on the sample -◦ holder by gravity.

The  experimental  apparatus  was  equipped  with in  situ thickness monitoring capabilities using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam model M-2000UI). Using this ellipsometer, the changes in the CoO film thickness were measured during etching. For the SE experiments, cobalt oxide films with an initial thickness of 60 nm were deposited by ALD using CoCl2(TMEDA) and H2O at 250  C directly on a silicon wafer ◦ with native oxide [54]. This deposition was performed at ASM Microchemistry Oy.

At  a  deposition  temperature  of  250 ◦ C,  x-ray  diffraction  (XRD) analysis reveals that the as-deposited CoO ALD films have diffraction peaks that are mostly from the hexagonal phase and some cubic phase [54]. The silicon wafers containing CoO were precut to 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm coupons  from  the  300  mm  wafers.  The  B-Spline  model  was  used  to determine thickness change from the ellipsometry results during CoO etching.

This paper measured the etch rates during CoO thermal ALE using spectroscopic  ellipsometry  (SE).  Grazing  incidence  X-ray  diffraction

Acetylacetone  ((Hacac) &gt; 99%,  Millipore  Sigma)  and  industrial grade O2 (Airgas) were the chemical precursors. The O2 was used as the

feed  gas  for  the  O3 generator.  The  O3  was  produced  by  a  generator (O3ONIA CFS-1A) with an ozone output of ~15 wt%. Hacac was kept in a gold-plated  stainless-steel vessel to minimize  contact  with  the stainless-steel  walls.  Ultra-high  purity  (UHP)  grade  N2 (99.9999%, Airgas) was utilized as the carrier and purge gas. The reported reactant pressures refer to their partial pressures with respect to the background N2 gas pressure of ~1 Torr.

diameter and entered the differentially pumped QMS region [56]. The distance between the aperture and skimmer was 29.2 mm. The ionization voltage was 70 eV for all the QMS experiments. In this work, the QMS scans from m z / 2 500 with a 1.0  s  scan  time  were  performed -continuously during the 120 s reactant exposures with 300 s purges between exposures. Spectra were obtained by averaging 100 s of each 120 s dose and subtracting the baseline from the previous N2 purge.

## 2.2. X-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

For the cobalt oxide thin films, XRD was employed to determine the crystalline phase before and after the reactant exposures. GIXRD scans were  obtained  by  a  high-resolution  X-ray  diffractometer  (Bede  D1, Bruker) using Cu K α ( λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation. All the GIXRD thin film results were collected using an incidence angle Ω = 0.5 , a scan step size ◦ of 0.03 , and a count time of 5 s per step. An atomic force microscope ◦ (Park  Systems  NX10)  employing  non-contact  mode  was  also  used  to measure surface roughness of the cobalt oxide films before and after ALE.

For the cobalt oxide nanopowder, powder XRD was used to analyze the crystalline phase before and after Hacac exposures. A Bruker AXS D8 Advance A25 with Cu K α radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) was used for these powder XRD studies. Each 2 Theta scan was from 30 ◦ to 80 ◦ with a step size  of  0.03 ◦ .  Powder  diffraction  of  unprocessed  metallic  Co  micropowder (99.9%, 1.3 µ m, trace metals basis) supplied by US Research Nanomaterials was also utilized for comparative study.

The CoO and Co3O4 nanopowders were processed in a separate hotwalled reactor for subsequent analysis by ex situ powder XRD [55]. CoO and Co3O4 nanopowders with a mass of ~1.0 g were loaded into the hotwalled reactor. The nanopowders were then subjected to 15 sequential Hacac exposures at a pressure of 5.0 Torr for 60 s at a temperature of 250  C. There were N2 purges for 120 s between each Hacac exposure. ◦ Prior to the Hacac exposures, the reactor was preconditioned without the nanopowder samples using ten Hacac exposures. Each Hacac exposure was at 5.0 Torr for 60 s.

X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  (PHI  5600)  was  used  to determine the binding energy of Co to identify the oxidation state. A monochromatic  Al  K α x-ray  source  (1486.6  eV)  was  used  to  collect survey scans with a pass energy of 93.9 eV and step size of 0.400 eV. Auger  Scan  software  package  (RBD  Instruments)  was  employed  to collect the data. Casa XPS (Casa Software) was used to determine the surface  concentrations  using  the  peak  areas  and  the  corresponding sensitivity factors.

The Co 2p results presented in the paper are shown with Shirley background subtraction. All data represent the average of 10 consecutive survey scans. All spectra were referenced to the adventitious carbon peak  centered  at  285.0  eV.  XPS  was  also  used  to  determine  the composition of the initial cobalt oxide ALD film. After 2 min of Ar + sputtering  on  an  as-deposited  cobalt  oxide  ALD  thin  film,  the  bulk showed a composition of: O 1s (48.07 at.%), Co 2p (51.93 at.%). The Ar + ion  sputtering  energy  and  ion  current  were  3  keV  and  1.6 μ A, respectively.

## 2.3. Quadrupole mass spectrometry

The etching of CoO and Co3O4  powders by Hacac was studied at 250  C using gas phase quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) to identify ◦ volatile  etch  products  in  a  separate  experimental  setup  [43,56].  A detailed description of this QMS reactor design has been given in previous publications [43,56]. The average N2  background pressure was 2.6 Torr and the average precursor pressure was 2.4 Torr. During the QMS experiments, the N2  carrier gas and precursor and product gases were used to form a molecular beam [56]. The molecular beam formed as  a  fraction  of  the  gases  traveled  through  a  300 µ m  aperture  and expanded into a differentially pumped region.

The molecular beam then passed through a skimmer with a 1.4 mm

The CoO (99.7 %, 50 nm) and Co3O4 ( &gt; 99.5 %, 30 -50 nm) powders used  in  the  QMS  experiments  were  supplied  by  US  Research  Nanomaterials.  CoO and Co3O4  nanopowders with a mass of 1.00 g were loaded and degassed in the reactor using a turbomolecular pump at the reaction temperature for &gt; 12 h prior to experiments.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Spectroscopic ellipsometry studies of CoO thin film etching

Initial experiments determined if Hacac could spontaneously etch a crystalline CoO thin film. In agreement with previous reports, the initial CoO thin film grown using CoO ALD was determined by GIXRD to be mostly crystalline h-CoO [54]. The SE measurements of the CoO film thickness versus number of Hacac doses at 250 and 275  C are shown in ◦ Fig. 2. Hacac was repeatedly exposed at a pressure of ~0.23 Torr for 1.0 s with 30 s purges in between the Hacac doses. SE measurements were recorded after each Hacac dose during the purge step. The results show a relatively slow spontaneous etch of CoO by Hacac at a rate of 0.08 ± 0.004 Å per Hacac dose at 250  C and 0.09 ◦ ± 0.009 Å per Hacac dose at 275  C. ◦

The slow spontaneous etching of CoO by Hacac is believed to occur by a ligand substitution and hydrogen transfer reaction:

$$\begin{smallmatrix} \dots \dots \dots \end{smallmatrix} \quad \begin{smallmatrix} \text{Co} 0 + 2 Hacac \rightarrow \text{Co} (acac) _ { 2 } + H _ { 2 } 0 \end{smallmatrix} \quad \begin{smallmatrix} ( 1 ) \end{smallmatrix}$$

The acac ligand substitutes for O in CoO to form Co(acac)2. The H on Hacac also transfers to CoO to form H2O. Earlier studies observed the spontaneous etching of cobalt oxide by Hacac [41,57]. The cobalt oxide was formed by oxidation of metallic cobalt using an O2 plasma.

The spontaneous etch of CoO by Hacac could be hindered by surface bound Hacac species as well as Hacac decomposition products that block CoO etching.  Consequently,  the  CoO  was  subsequently  etched  using sequential Hacac and O3 exposures as illustrated in Fig. 1. The O3  was assumed to provide cleaning that could remove carbon-containing species from  the  surface.  O3 exposures  should  yield  CO2 and  H2O

combustion products during the removal of carbon species. Hacac exposures can then etch CoO until the Hacac reaction is again blocked by Hacac or carbon species on the CoO surface.

Fig. 3 shows the SE results observed during etching at 200 and 250  C ◦ using  sequential  exposures  of  Hacac  and  O3.  Etching  was  performed using an Hacac exposure for 1.5 s at 0.12 Torr, a purge for 40 s, an O3 exposure for 1.0 s at 0.28 Torr, and then another purge for 40 s. The cobalt oxide film thickness decreased linearly at a rate of 0.09 ± 0.001 Å/cycle at 200  C and 0.43 ◦ ± 0.001 Å/cycle at 250  C. ◦

The inclusion of the O3  exposure increased the etch rate at 250 ◦ C from 0.08 Å per Hacac dose in Fig. 2 to 0.43 Å/cycle in Fig. 3. This increase in etch rate is attributed to the ability of O3  to clean carboncontaining  species  from  the  CoO  surface.  These  carbon  species  may result from surface-coordinated Hacac species or the decomposition of Hacac on the surface. Additional experiments were performed under identical conditions at a lower temperature of 200 ◦ C. The lower temperature resulted in a smaller etch rate of 0.09 Å/cycle. This smaller etch rate indicates that CoO thermal ALE is a thermally-activated process.

The self-limiting nature of the Hacac and O3  reactions at 250 ◦ C is explored  in  Fig.  4.  The  experiments  for  Hacac  were  conducted  by varying the Hacac exposure times from 1.0 to 2.5 s while fixing the O3 exposure  time  at  1.5  s.  The  experiments  for  O3 were  performed  by varying the O3 exposure times from 1.0 to 2.5 s while fixing the Hacac exposure time at 1.5 s. The purge times for both experiments were 40 s. The CoO etch rate increases rapidly with increasing Hacac or O3 exposure time. The etch rate then levels out at longer Hacac or O3 exposure times. There is reasonably self-limiting behavior versus both the Hacac and O3 exposures.

Self-limiting behavior for the O3 exposures would be expected if the role of the O3 is to remove carbon-containing species from the surface. The etch rate would be expected to reach a limit when the carbon species have been removed from the surface. The self-limiting behavior for the Hacac  exposures  would  be  expected  if  the  Hacac  species  adsorb  or decompose and block the spontaneous etching of CoO. The etch rate may become  negligible  after  a  particular  Hacac  exposure  time.  Further spontaneous etching would then require an O3  exposure to clean the CoO surface.

deposited CoO thin film showed diffraction peaks at 2 θ values of 31.90, 34.63, 36.4, 47.87, 56.80, and 67.90 . These diffraction peaks corre-◦ spond  to  the  (100),  (002),  (101),  (102),  (110)  and  (112)  crystal planes of hexagonal CoO (h-CoO). These assignments are based on the reference powder diffraction data for hexagonal CoO (JCPDS, card no. 89-2803). There are also diffraction peaks at 2 θ values of 42.59 ◦ and 61.9 attributed to the (200) and (220) crystal planes of cubic CoO (cCoO). In agreement with earlier studies, the initial CoO thin films grown by ALD using CoCl2(TMEDA) and H2O at 250  C are mostly hexagonal ◦ phase with some cubic phase [54].

Fig. 5b shows the GIXRD results for a CoO thin film etched by 300 cycles  of  alternating  Hacac  and  O3  exposures  at  250 ◦ C.  The  GIXRD results are shown after the Hacac exposure. The CoO thermal ALE was performed using sequential exposures of Hacac for 2 s and O3  for 2 s. There was a purge for 40 s between the Hacac and O3 exposures. This diffraction pattern differs from h-CoO in Fig. 5a. The diffraction peaks at 2 θ = 36.50, 42.30, and 61.90 ◦ in Fig. 5b correspond to the (111), (200),

Fig. 5. XRD diffractograms for: (a) initial CoO thin film on Si prior to etching (h-CoO); and (b) CoO thin film after 300 ALE cycles using sequential Hacac and O3 exposures at 250  C (c-CoO). ◦

and (220) crystal planes of c-CoO (JCPDS, card no. 09-0402).

The results in Fig. 5b indicate that the initial CoO thin film phase has transformed from mostly h-CoO to c-CoO after the thermal ALE. Cubic CoO is reported to be a more thermodynamically stable phase than hCoO [58,59]. Two peaks at 59.53 and 65.38 ◦ in Fig. 5b are attributed to the (511) and (440) crystal planes of cubic crystalline Co3O4 (c-Co3O4) (JCPDS, card no. 42-1467). The appearance of these two peaks suggests that CoO was produced by Hacac reduction of Co3O4 that was formed during the previous O3 cleaning step.

penetration depth in CoO is calculated to be between 36 and 43 nm [63]. This calculation employed CoO with a density of 6.44 g/cm 3 and two linear attenuation coefficients of µ = 1450 and µ = 1737 from the NIST standard  reference  database  [64].  These  were  the  two  closest  linear attenuation  coefficients  for  CoO  exposed  to  X-rays  at  8.04  keV.  The calculated penetration depth of 36 -43 nm is consistent with the GIXRD measurements not observing the Si substrate underneath the CoO films. The GIXRD results are representative of the majority of the 60 nm CoO film and are not selective to the near surface region.

Fig. 6 displays the GIXRD results for initial CoO thin films and after 2, 10, and 410 consecutive O3  doses for 1.0 s at 0.12 Torr. New samples were used for each experiment. There was a purge of 70 s between each O3  dose. The diffraction spectrum of the initial CoO sample after 2 O3 doses shown in Fig. 6b is different than the diffraction pattern of the initial  CoO  sample  shown  in  Fig.  6a.  Peaks  at  47.87,  and  56.80 ◦ in Fig. 6a corresponding to (102) and (110) crystal planes of h-CoO are not observed in Fig. 6b. In addition, a new peak at 42.3 ◦ assigned to the (200) crystal planes of c-CoO appears in Fig. 6b.

Diffractograms of the cobalt oxide films after 10 and 410 of O3 doses are shown in Fig. 6c and 6d, respectively. After 10 O3  doses, Fig. 6c shows new peaks at 19.1, 31.30, 36.94, and 44.68 ◦ corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), and (400) crystal planes of c-Co3O4 (JCPDS, card no. 42-1467). In addition, the broad peaks around 31 and 37 ◦ can be also assigned to the (100) and (101) crystal planes of h-CoO and/or (111) crystal planes of c-CoO. After 110 O3  doses, Fig. 6d illustrates that the cobalt oxide film has converted almost completely to c-Co3O4. These results suggest that c-CoO is a transition phase between h-CoO and cCo3O4 during oxidation [9,60].

There is a direct relationship between the incident x-ray angle and the penetration depth of GIXRD measurements [61]. There is also an inverse relationship between the x-ray linear attenuation coefficient and the x-ray energy [62]. For an incident x-ray angle of Ω = 0.5 ◦ and an xray energy of 8.04 keV ( λ = 1.54056 Å) used in this study, the x-ray

## 3.3. XPS analysis of CoO thin films after O3 exposures and after CoO ALE

Fig. 7 shows the XPS Co 2p spectral region of three separate samples: the initial CoO thin film; the initial CoO film after 2 doses of O3; and the initial CoO film after 300 cycles of Co thermal ALE. The original h-CoO sample  was  etched  using  300  cycles  of  CoO  thermal  ALE  at  250 ◦ C ending with the Hacac exposure. These Co 2p spectra show spin -orbit splitting into 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 components and shake-up satellites above the main photoemission lines.

The Co 2p spectrum recorded for the as-deposited CoO film is shown in Fig. 7a. This spectrum is characterized by binding energy values of 780.05 eV for 2p3/2 and 796.12 eV for 2p1/2. There are also strong shakeup satellites at higher energies than the main photoemission lines. The binding energy of the strong satellite for the Co 2p3/2 peak is 785.15 eV. The Co 2p3/2 peak can be deconvolved into two peaks at 780.15 (light blue line) and 782.55 eV (green line). Both the shape of the spectrum and the binding energies are characteristic of h-CoO [65].

The XPS Co 2p spectrum after 2 O3 doses is shown in Fig. 7b. The Co 2p3/2  peak  at  780.3  eV  and  the  Co  2p1/2 peak at 795.05 eV can be assigned to c-Co3O4 [66]. In addition, a weak Co 2p3/2 satellite feature

for  Co3O4 at  788.71  eV  is  observed  with  significantly  less  intensity compared with the intense satellite for CoO. The Co 2p3/2 peak can be deconvolved into two peaks at 779.91 (light blue line) and 781.91 eV (green line). While Co 3 + shows relatively narrow 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 lines with minor satellites, Co 2 + generally exhibits broad 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 lines accompanied by intense  satellite  structures  [65,67 -69].  Very  similar spectra  to  the  spectrum  in  Fig.  7b  were  observed  for  the  CoO  films oxidized by 10 and 410 doses of O3 (not shown). These results suggest that two O3 doses are sufficient to oxidize CoO to Co3O4.

These results indicate that O3 exposures can both clean carbon from the surface and oxidize the underlying CoO substrate to Co3O4. The CoO to Co3O4  transformation is in agreement with previous reports where both h-CoO and c-CoO have been oxidized to Co3O4 when annealed in air at 240 ◦ C [60]. The oxidation reaction can be written as:

$$3 C o O + O _ { 3 } ( g ) \to C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } + O _ { 2 } ( g ) & & ( 2 ) & & \underline { \underline { \underline { \Theta } } }$$

This reaction is thermochemically favorable with a standard free energy change of Δ G ◦ (250  C) ◦ = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 71.8 kcal [70].

XPS results  for  the  CoO  film  after  300  cycles  of  Co  thermal  ALE ending with the Hacac exposure are shown in Fig. 7c. The Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks are observed at 781.5 and 795.22 eV, respectively. These peaks are shifted to higher energies compared with c-CoO and can be assigned to c-Co(OH)2 [68]. There are also strong shake-up satellites at higher energies than the main photoemission lines. The binding energy of the strong satellite for the Co 2p3/2  peak is 787.08 eV. The Co 2p3/2 peak can be deconvolved into two peaks at 781.48 (light blue line) and 783.88 eV (green line). This etched sample is consistent with Co in the + 2  oxidation  state  [67].  Cobalt  hydroxide  could  form  as  a  result  of exposure  to  ambient  air  after  the  etching  process  prior  to  the  XPS measurements [71,72].

The  XPS  measurements  are  surface  sensitive  because  only  photoelectrons produced near the surface can escape into vacuum [73]. The inelastic mean free path for photoelectrons at ~1000 eV is 1.5 -2.0 nm for many metals [74]. The photoelectron attenuation length at ~1000 eV is ≈ 2 nm for metal oxide materials such as FeO [75]. Consequently, most of the Co 2p photoelectrons emitted from the cobalt oxide sample are derived from depths of ≤ 6 nm [73]. The XPS measurements provide information regarding the near surface region of the initial cobalt oxide film.

The XRD measurements in Fig. 5b show some Co3O4 structure after the last Hacac exposure. The XPS measurements in Fig. 7b indicate that the initial CoO film can be easily oxidized to Co3O4 after 2 doses of O3. These results suggest that the surface of the cobalt oxide film is mostly Co3O4 after the O3 exposures during CoO thermal ALE. In addition, the XPS spectrum in Fig. 7c is consistent with the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO after the last Hacac exposure during CoO thermal ALE. These results argue that Hacac can react with Co3O4 to produce combustion products and reduce Co3O4 to CoO.

## 3.4. XRD analysis of cobalt oxide powders before and after Hacac exposures

XRD powder spectra were also utilized to monitor the effect of Hacac exposure on CoO and Co3O4  powders. Fig. 8a displays the diffraction patterns for the as-received c-CoO powder control samples. The main three diffraction peaks for c-CoO are located at 2 θ = 36.5, 42.4, and 61.5.  These  diffraction  peaks  are  assigned  to  the  (111),  (200)  and (220) crystal planes, respectively, of c-CoO (JCPDS, card no. 09-0402). Fig. 8b shows the diffraction patterns of c-CoO after 15 Hacac exposures at 250 ◦ C. The diffraction patterns for the c-CoO powders before and after Hacac exposure are very similar. This similarity indicates that the Hacac exposure has not affected the c-CoO powders.

Fig. 9a displays the diffraction patterns for the as-received Co3O4 powder samples. Seven main peaks are located at 2 θ = 19.0, 31.3, 36.9, 38.5,  44.8,  55.6,  59.4,  and  68.6 ◦ .  These  peaks  are  identified  as  the

(220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystal planes of c-Co3O4  (JCPDS, card no. 42 -1467). Fig. 9b shows the diffraction patterns  of  Co3O4 after  15  Hacac  exposures  at  250 ◦ C.  The  diffraction patterns in Fig. 9a and Fig. 9b are different. The differences indicate that Hacac exposure has reacted with the Co3O4 powders.

The diffraction peaks associated with the (220) and (422) crystal planes of Co3O4  in Fig. 9a are greatly reduced in Fig. 9b after Hacac

exposure. Concurrently, there is a rise of diffraction peaks at 2 θ = 42.4 and 61.5 in Fig. 9b. These peaks are assigned to the (200) and (220) crystal planes of c-CoO. These changes suggest that the Co3O4  powder has been partially reduced to CoO by the Hacac exposure.

A  Co3O4  reduction  to  cubic  CoO  could  proceed  through  a  Hacac combustion reaction:

$$C _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } + 1 / 1 2 \, C _ { 5 } H _ { 8 } O _ { 2 } \to 3 C o O + 5 / 1 2 \, C O _ { 2 } ( g ) + 1 / 3 \, H _ { 2 } O ( g ) \quad \ \ ( 3 ) \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \$$

prominent ion signal intensities are observed at m z / = 257 and 242. These ion signals are attributed to Co(acac)2 + and Co(acac)(C4H4O2) + . These  ion  signals  are  both  derived  from  the  parent  Co(acac)2 etch product. The acac ligand has the formula C5H7O2. C4H4O2 + results from acac that has lost one -CH3 group. Ion signals were also observed for Co (acac) + with the largest ion signal intensity observed at m z / 158. In addition, the Co(acac) + ion signal had a higher intensity than Co(acac)2 + in agreement with the reported cracking pattern of Co(acac)2 [81].

This reaction is thermochemically favorable with a standard free energy change of Δ G (250  C) ◦ ◦ =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 23.6 kcal [70]. This reduction process is also consistent with the XPS observations after Hacac exposure to Co3O4 thin films. Co3O4 reduction could also result from vacuum annealing. However, reduction by vacuum annealing is less likely because of the higher temperatures and lower pressures required for this reduction [76].

There is a possibility that CoO could be further reduced to metallic Co by Hacac combustion [77,78]. However, Hacac exposure to either CoO  or  Co3O4 powder  did  not  show  any  evidence  of  reduction  to metallic Co. Metallic Co powder was analyzed by XRD to establish a background reference. These powder XRD scans showed evidence for both fcc-Co and hcp-Co. Diffraction peaks were observed at 2 θ = 42.1, 44.5, and 47.2 for hcp-Co and 2 θ = 44.2 and 51.3 ◦ for fcc-Co (JCPDS cards no. 00-105-0806 and 04-001-3273). None of these metallic Co diffraction peaks were observed in Fig. 8b or Fig. 9b.

## 3.5. Quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis of reaction products

Quadrupole  mass  spectrometry  (QMS)  studies  were  performed  to identify the gas phase products from the reaction of Hacac with c-CoO and Co3O4 powders. Initially, control QMS experiments were performed without c-CoO and Co3O4  powders in the reactor. These experiments demonstrated  that  Hacac  was  thermally  stable  at  250 ◦ C.  The  QMS spectrum was consistent with the fragmentation pattern of Hacac reported  in  the  NIST  Chemistry  WebBook  [79].  These  results  are  also consistent with the previously reported decomposition temperature for acetylacetone at ~480  C [80]. ◦

Fig. 10 shows the gas-phase reaction products in the high mass region from m z / 235 263 during Hacac exposure to c-CoO and Co3O4 -powders at 250 ◦ C.  Cobalt  acetylacetone  etch  products  are  observed during  the  spontaneous  etch  of  c-CoO  and  Co3O4 powders.  The

<!-- image -->

The signal intensity of Co(acac)2 + etch product from the CoO and Co3O4  powders are shown in Fig. 10a and Fig. 10b, respectively. The Co3O4  powder  yields  a  signal  about  2.5  times  larger  than  the  CoO powder.  This  larger  signal  intensity  could  indicate  a  more  efficient spontaneous etching reaction for Hacac exposures on the Co3O4 powder. The larger signal intensity could also be attributed to the slightly higher surface area of the Co3O4  powder with 30 -50 nm particle diameters compared with the c-CoO powder with ~50 nm particle diameters. The smaller particle diameter for the Co3O4  powder also led to the powder packing more tightly in the sample holder mesh. This tighter packing increased the Hacac partial pressure in the sample holder given the same 8.0 Torr manifold Hacac pressure. The Hacac partial pressure on Co3O4 was 3.4 Torr and the Hacac partial pressure on CoO was 1.4 Torr above the N2 base pressure.

In  addition,  no  Co-containing ion signal intensities were detected above m z / 260. Despite observation of trace levels of Cr(acac)3 + and Fe (acac)3 + ion intensities attributed to etching products from the stainless steel chamber walls at m z / 349 and m z / 353, there was no evidence for an ion signal for Co(acac)3 + at m z / = 356. These results argue that Co (acac)2  is the main etch product. The oxidation state for cobalt in Co (acac)2  is 2 + .  Cobalt in the 3 + oxidation state would be expected to yield Co(acac)3  as the etch product. Co(acac)3  is unlikely as an etch product based on these QMS investigations. These results are consistent with the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO during Hacac exposures.

There  were  also  some  minority  ion  signal  intensities  observed  in Fig. 10 at m z / 239 and 254. These smaller ion signals are attributed to Fe (acac)2 + and Fe(acac)(C4H4O2) + . Trace Fe(acac)3  was also observed at m z / 353 as mentioned above. Fe(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3 may be formed by the  reaction  between  Hacac  and  iron  oxide  on  the  stainless-steel chamber walls. Alternatively, there may be a possible ligand transfer between the Co(acac)2 etch product and iron on the chamber walls [82]. There is also a small ion signal for Cr(acac)2 + at m z / 250 in Fig. 10. This Cr product is also attributed to an etch product from the stainless-steel chamber walls.

Fig. 11 displays an expanded view of the mass spectrum from m z / 256 to 261 during the Hacac exposure on the Co3O4  powders. This region of the mass spectrum displays the Co(acac)2 + ion signal intensity. The largest ion signal intensity is observed for Co(acac)2 + at m z / 257. There is also a smaller peak for Co(acac)2  with one 13 C at m z / 258. Fig. 11 shows that the experimental ion signal intensities are in excellent agreement with the calculated signal intensities based on the natural isotopic abundances. The ion signal intensity at m z / 258 is 11.2 % of the ion  signal  intensity  at m z / 257  as  expected  for  the  natural  isotopic abundance of 13 C.

QMS analysis was also utilized to study the combustion of Hacac by CoO and Co3O4  powders at 250 ◦ C. These measurements are difficult because CO2 and H2O are the combustion products and CO2 and H2O are also in the residual background gas in the reactor. However, the QMS analysis revealed that more combustion products were observed for the reaction of Hacac with Co3O4  powder. These combustion products are consistent with the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO during Hacac exposures.

Fig. 12a and Fig. 12b show mass spectra from m z / 10 to 50 during the first 9 s of Hacac exposure on fresh Co3O4 and CoO powder, respectively, at 250  C. These mass spectra have been normalized using the C2H3O ◦ + ion signal from Hacac at m z / 43. The ion signal intensities for CO2 at m z / 44 and H2O at m z / 18 are both larger for the Co3O4 powder in Fig. 12b. These larger CO2 and H2O ion signals argue for more Hacac combustion on the Co3O4 powder.

## 3.6. Atomic force microscopy analysis of surface roughness

The effect of CoO thermal ALE on surface roughness was studied using AFM measurements. Surface smoothing by ALE has been previously  reported  during  the  ALE  of  many  materials  such  as  Al2O3 [21,23,26], HfO2  [19], and Si3N4  [36]. The AFM measurements were conducted on CoO films that were etched with sequential Hacac and O3 exposures at 250  C. Fig. 13a shows the AFM image and AFM line-scan ◦ for the initial CoO film. This surface has an RMS surface roughness of 40.4  Å.  The  surface  consists  of  large  grains,  previously  identified  as hexagonal  pyramid-like  crystallites,  surrounded  by  a  smoother  layer consisting of smaller grains [54].

Fig. 13b shows the AFM image and AFM line-scan for the initial CoO

film after 300 ALE cycles of Hacac and O3 at 250  C. This surface has a ◦ lower RMS surface roughness of 14.0 Å. The observed decrease in surface roughness can result from the CoO thermal ALE. The decrease in surface roughness could also result from the change in film crystallinity. The initial CoO film was largely h-CoO according to XRD analysis. The hCoO and was converted to c-CoO after CoO thermal ALE ending with an Hacac exposure. Previous studies showed that c-CoO films possess lower roughness values compared to h-CoO films [54].

## 3.7. CoO thermal ALE reaction mechanism

Fig. 14 shows a more detailed mechanism for CoO thermal ALE using Hacac and O3  as the reactants. This mechanism incorporates the key findings of this investigation. During the first O3 exposure (step B ), the ' O3  cleans residual carbon from the h-CoO surface. In addition, the O3

J.L. Partridge et al.

exposure  also  oxidizes  the  top  layer  of  the  CoO  film  to  Co3O4.  The oxidation state of initial cobalt oxide changes from 2 + in h-CoO to a mixture of 2 + and 3 + in Co3O4.

The  steady  state  CoO  thermal  ALE  process  is  then  defined  by sequential  Hacac  (step  A)  and  O3 (step  B)  reactions.  The  Hacac  undergoes combustion on Co3O4 and reduces Co3O4 to CoO. CO2 and H2O combustion  products  are  also  observed  in  the  gas  phase.  The  Hacac exposure also removes cobalt and produces Co(acac)2 etch products in the gas phase. The H in Hacac also reacts with oxygen in CoO to produce H2O. The etching of CoO by Hacac is then progressively blocked by the adsorption and decomposition of Hacac to produce carbon species on the CoO surface. The O3  reaction (step B) then cleans carbon species from the surface. In addition, the O3 exposure oxidizes the surface layer from c-CoO to c-Co3O4.

thin films by Hacac alone was shown to be slow at 0.08 Å per Hacac dose at 250  C. This slow spontaneous etching was attributed to the adsorp-◦ tion and decomposition of Hacac and the buildup of carbon species on the surface that blocks the etching. After adding O3 exposures to remove carbon from the CoO surface, an etch rate of 0.43 Å/cycle was obtained at 250  C using sequential Hacac and O3 exposures. The Hacac and O3 ◦ reactions were demonstrated to be reasonably self-limiting after long exposures.

The primarily h-CoO phase of the initial CoO ALD film does not return after the Hacac and O3 exposures during CoO thermal ALE. The CoO structure  after  the  Hacac  exposure  is  identified  as  c-CoO.  The  CoO thermal  ALE  proceeds  with  the  surface  layer  alternating  between oxidation to Co3O4 and reduction to CoO by the O3 and Hacac exposures, respectively. The transition between c-CoO and c-Co3O4 has previously been shown to be reversible [9]. The ease of switching between c-Co3O4 and c-CoO can be attributed to an epitaxial relationship between these two phases [9,60] as well as the nanocrystalline nature of the films [83].

## 4. Conclusions

The O3 exposures were also observed to oxidize the top layer of the CoO thin film to Co3O4. This oxidation increased the oxidation state from 2 + to 2 + /3 + and converted the initial mostly h-CoO crystalline phase to c-Co3O4. The subsequent Hacac exposures then reduced the oxidation state back to 2 + by converting the c-Co3O4 film to c-CoO. This reduction resulted from the combustion of Hacac to produce CO2  and H2O combustion products. In addition, the Hacac also removed cobalt oxide by forming Co(acac)2 and H2O gas phase etch products.

Experiments with Co3O4 and CoO powders confirmed the oxidation state  changes  during  Hacac  exposures.  Crystalline  c-Co3O4 powders were reduced and converted to crystalline c-CoO by Hacac exposures. In contrast, crystalline c-CoO powders exposed to Hacac did not display noticeable change. These studies reveal that the sequential O3 and Hacac reactant exposures during CoO thermal ALE can oxidize CoO to Co3O4 and reduce Co3O4 back to CoO, respectively, as they etch the CoO surface. CoO thermal ALE also displays distinctive changes between c-CoO and c-Co3O4 crystal structures during the alternating Hacac and O3 exposures that volatilize the surface layer.

The thermal atomic layer etching of CoO was demonstrated using Hacac and O3 as the reactants. Initially, the spontaneous etching of CoO
