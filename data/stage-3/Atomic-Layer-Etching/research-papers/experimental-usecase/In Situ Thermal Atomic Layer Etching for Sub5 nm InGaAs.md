ABSTRACT: Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) was demonstrated on ternary III -V compound semiconductors. In particular, thermal ALE on InGaAs and InAlAs was achieved with sequential, self-limiting /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions using hydrogen /uniFB02 uoride (HF) as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant and dimethylaluminum chloride (DMAC) as the ligand-exchange reactant. Thermal ALE was investigated on planar surfaces and three-dimensional nanostructures. The measured radial etch rates on In 0.53 Ga0.47 As and In0.52 Al0.48 As vertical nanowires (VNWs) at 300 ° C were 0.24 and 0.62 Å/cycle, respectively. An optimized thermal ALE process did not increase the surface roughness after 200 cycles.

The etching process also displayed selectivity and orientation dependence. This new thermal ALE process in combination with in situ atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to fabricate InGaAs gate-all-around structures with minimum width down to 3 nm. The in situ ALE-ALD process produced a sharp vertical MOS interface. Finally, the merits of thermal ALE were demonstrated in the fabrication of n-channel InGaAs FinFETs with record ON-state and OFF-state transistor performance. On the basis of this transistor demonstration, thermal ALE shows great promise for high-volume device manufacturing.

A s complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to scale following Moore s ' law, device fabrication has entered the era of nanoscale threedimensional (3D) structures. Since the introduction of Si multigate metal-oxide-semiconductor /uniFB01 eld-e /uniFB00 ect transistors (MOSFETs), there has been a relentless e /uniFB00 ort using smaller and higher aspect ratio structures to overcome short-channel e /uniFB00 ects and achieve higher current density. State-of-the-art Si FinFETs have /uniFB01 n widths ( W f ) as narrow as 7 nm and /uniFB01 n heights ( H f ) as tall as 50 nm. 1 To keep scaling, future generations of CMOS will employ gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire structures 2 -4 and alternative channel materials, such as Ge and III -V compound semiconductors. 5 -8 To realize devices beyond the 5 nm node, fabrication technology demands etching and deposition with unprecedented precision.

Thermal ALE is another type of ALE that avoids using plasma and is a more recent development. Thermal ALE was /uniFB01 rst reported for Al O 2 3 in 2015. 14,15 The reaction sequence of thermal ALE closely resembles the reaction sequence of thermal ALD. Thermal ALE consists of surface modi /uniFB01 cation usually by /uniFB02 uorination. The surface /uniFB02 uorination can be followed by desorption usually resulting from ligand-exchange reactions. Thermal ALE can be performed in an ALD reactor without the aid of plasma and enables selective and damage free etching. The etching can also be isotropic if there are no crystallographic e /uniFB00 ects. Thermal ALE has been successfully reported for various thin/uniFB01 lm materials, including metal oxides (Al2 O3, HfO2, ZrO2), 15 -17 metal /uniFB02 uorides and nitrides (AlF , 3 TiN), 18,19 and recently Si as well. 20

In recent years, atomic layer etching (ALE) has emerged as an etching technique with atomic-level precision. 9,10 ALE comprises two sequential reactions that are self-limiting. One type of ALE is plasma ALE. In plasma ALE, the /uniFB01 rst step is an activation step in which the surface of the /uniFB01 lm is modi /uniFB01 ed by reactive species, such as Cl2 plasma. 9 The second step is a desorption step in which the modi ed layer /uniFB01 is removed by energetic ions or neutrals, such as Ar plasma. 11 -13 Plasma ALE is driven by ion /uniFB02 ux and is highly anisotropic. Plasma ALE is also useful for many processes that involve pattern transfer.

Still in its youth, thermal ALE research has mainly focused on developing new recipes to etch various thin /uniFB01 lms. However, the usefulness of thermal ALE needs to be demonstrated through the fabrication of transistors. In this work, thermal ALE is investigated for etching of /uniFB01 ns or nanowires with minimal damage. Integration with ALD in an in situ process should also be possible to eliminate air exposure during the

gate stack process. Preventing contamination and oxidation of the etched channel surface is highly desired in CMOS fabrication.

In this Letter, thermal ALE was performed on III -V compound semiconductors, which constitute an important family of semiconductors for their potential as future highmobility transistor channel materials. 21,22 Thermal ALE was also demonstrated on ternary compounds. The device worthiness of thermal ALE in combination with in situ ALD was illustrated by fabricating high aspect ratio In 0.53 Ga0.47 As nchannel FinFETs.

and Al(CH3)3 (timethylaluminum, TMA). Gaseous hydrogen /uniFB02 uoride (HF) derived from HF-pyridine was the /uniFB02 uorination reactant. TMA was the reactive reagent for ligand-exchange. 24 HF/TMA has been employed for the thermal ALE of Al2O3 and HfO2. 17 TMA may be able to etch In and Ga compounds because In(CH3)3 and Ga(CH3)3 are volatile. However, HF/ TMA was not able to etch InGaAs. Figure 1a shows XRR scans of InGaAs ALE performed with HF/TMA for 200 cycles at reaction temperatures of 250 and 300 ° C. The XRR scans revealed negligible change in the InGaAs /uniFB01 lm thickness at both reaction temperatures.

The experiments were performed in a viscous/uniFB02 ow, hot-wall ALD reactor. 23 The baseline pressure was 5 -10 mTorr and the ambient pressure was ∼ 1 Torr with 150 sccm of N2 /uniFB02 ow. The starting heterostructure used to develop the process consisted of 70 nm of In0.53 Ga0.47 As on a 300 nm In0.52Al0.48 As bu /uniFB00 er, grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a semi-insulating InP substrate. Planar substrates were /uniFB01 rst examined to establish the ALE process before moving to vertical structures. For planar substrates etched by various thermal ALE processes, Xray re /uniFB02 ectivity (XRR) measurements were used to determine the etching rates.

In this work, three etching processes were employed for thermal ALE on InGaAs: (1) HF/TMA, (2) ozone/HF/TMA, and (3) HF/DMAC. These experiments showed that the HF/ DMAC process provided the best working conditions for InGaAs thermal ALE. The details of each etching process are described as follows.

Figure 1a -c shows XRR measurements of planar InGaAs surfaces after thermal ALE using sequential exposures of HF

The /uniFB02 uorination of InGaAs may be di /uniFB03 cult with HF. To facilitate /uniFB02 uorination, a three-step process with an oxidation step was tested using ozone (O3) before HF/TMA. Ozone forms oxides, such as In O3 2 and Ga2O3, on the InGaAs /uniFB01 lm. Fluorination of oxides such as In O 2 3 and Ga2O3, which form InF3 and GaF3, respectively, is more favorable than /uniFB02 uorination of metal arsenides such as InAs and GaAs. 25 Figure 1b shows XRR scans before and after 200 cycles of O /HF/TMA at 250 3 ° C. The XRR scans are consistent with the formation of a 34 Å oxide layer on the surface without noticeable decrease in the total /uniFB01 lm thickness. These experiments indicate that TMA is not an e /uniFB03 cient metal reactant for InGaAs thermal ALE. TMA can only provide CH3 ligands during the ligand-exchange reaction. Alternative ligands may be needed for InGaAs thermal ALE.

A di /uniFB00 erent metal precursor, AlCl(CH3)2 (dimethylaluminum chloride, DMAC) was also tested using a O3/HF/DMAC three-step sequence. 17 DMAC can provide two di /uniFB00 erent ligands, CH3 and Cl, for the ligand-exchange reaction. To

test DMAC, 200 cycles of O3/HF/DMAC exposure were examined at 250 ° C as shown in Figure 1b. The XRR scans are consistent with a 50 Å decrease in total /uniFB01 lm thickness and a 23 Å oxide remaining on the surface. These results demonstrate the promise of DMAC for InGaAs thermal ALE.

DMAC may work for InGaAs thermal ALE without an oxidation step. To test this idea, DMAC was employed with HF without ozone. Figure 1c shows XRR scans for HF/DMAC thermal ALE at 250 ° C. The InGaAs /uniFB01 lm thickness was decreased by 19 Å after 200 cycles and an additional 22 Å after a total of 400 cycles. The average etch rate over 400 cycles was 0.1 Å/cycle. XRR modeling was consistent with a negligible oxide thickness. These results con /uniFB01 rm InGaAs thermal ALE using the HF/DMAC process.

The etch products in (2) that include Cl, such as InCl(CH3)2 and GaCl(CH3)2, are expected to be produced because TMA does not work as a ligand-exchange reactant in InGaAs thermal ALE. DMAC may play an essential role by providing Cl ligand during the ligand-exchange reaction. Equation 2 assumes that each ligand-exchange reaction involves a separate AlCl(CH3)2 precursor. Ligand-transfer between Cl and F will produce AlF(CH3)2. Ligand-transfer between CH3 and F will produce AlClF(CH3). These proposed etch products need to be con /uniFB01 rmed by mass spectrometer studies.

Figure 1d illustrates the proposed reaction mechanism for the HF/DMAC thermal ALE chemistry. During the /uniFB01 rst halfcycle, a HF pulse /uniFB02 uorinates the InGaAs surface. HF forms nonvolatile metal /uniFB02 uorides, such as InF 3 and GaF3, and releases gaseous AsH3 byproducts that are purged away. The surface chemistry is proposed as follows

$$\ln _ { 0. 5 } G a _ { 0. 5 } A s ( s ) + 3 H F ( g ) \to 0. 5 I n F _ { 3 } ( s ) + 0. 5 G a F _ { 3 } ( s ) + A s H _ { 3 } ( g ) \quad ( 1 ) \quad \text{int} _ { 2 }$$

In the second half-cycle, a DMAC pulse is introduced to remove InF3 and GaF3 by ligand-exchange reactions. DMAC provides Cl and CH3 to form volatile etch products, such as GaCl(CH3)2 and InCl(CH3)2. The proposed surface chemistry in the second half-cycle is as follows

InF(s)

Performing thermal ALE on planar thin /uniFB01 lms facilitates process development and con /uniFB01 rms etching behavior. However, examination of thermal ALE on realistic device structures, especially on nonplanar nanostructures, is critical. Imaging of nanoscale structures can be used to provide direct etch rate measurement in both lateral and vertical directions. In contrast, most thin/uniFB01 lm thickness measurements rely on parameter /uniFB01 tting and only measure thickness in the vertical direction. Etching 3D structures also examines important aspects of integration of thermal ALE in advanced transistor fabrication.

Before investigating the integration of thermal ALE in a full transistor process, thermal ALE was /uniFB01 rst be applied to etch /uniFB01 n and vertical nanowire (VNW) sidewalls. Figure 2a shows InGaAs/InAlAs VNWs fabricated by BCl3/SiCl4/Ar reactive ion etching (RIE). 26 Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) was used as the etch hardmask. VNW diameters and etch rates were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After RIE, the VNWs were 28 nm in diameter and 185 nm in height. Subsequently, the VNWs were etched by thermal ALE with the HF/DMAC process for 300 cycles at 250 ° C. The diameters of

the InGaAs and InAlAs portions of the VNWs have decreased to 24 and 18 nm, respectively. The changes in radius of the InGaAs and InAlAs VNWs versus number of cycles at 250 ° C are summarized in Figure 2d. These results demonstrate a substantially di /uniFB00 erent etching rate between InGaAs and InAlAs by thermal ALE.

0.41 Å/cycle on average, respectively. The thermal ALE of InGaAs at 300 ° C also slows down after a large number of cycles, whereas the etch rate of InAlAs ALE remains relatively linear. The changes in radius of the InGaAs and InAlAs VNWs versus number of cycles at 300 ° C are summarized in Figure 2d.

The partial etching selectivity between InGaAs and InAlAs is an important /uniFB01 nding. This selectivity might occur because /uniFB02 uorination of AlAs (Gibbs free energy Δ G ° = -86.0 kcal/ mol) is thermochemically more favorable than the /uniFB02 uorination of GaAs ( Δ G ° = -17.4 kcal/mol) at 250 ° C. This behavior is also consistent with the faster oxidation of InAlAs versus InGaAs at 300 -500 ° C. 27 Fluorination/oxidation of InAlAs is probably more favorable than for InGaAs because Al -F/Al-O bonds are stronger than Ga -F/Ga-O bonds. 28

At 300 ° C, the radial etch rates of InGaAs and InAlAs VNWs for the /uniFB01 rst 250 cycles are 0.24 and 0.62 Å/cycle on average, respectively. After the second 250 cycles, the radial etch rates of InGaAs and InAlAs VNWs decrease to 0.10 and

After the 300 cycles of thermal ALE at 250 ° C, another 300 cycles of thermal ALE were performed at 250 ° C. Figure 2a shows that the diameter of InAlAs VNWs continued to shrink to 10 nm, whereas the etching of InGaAs VNWs nearly stopped. The negligible etching of InGaAs after 300 cycles of thermal ALE at 250 ° C may be caused by the low temperature of 250 ° C. Consequently, thermal ALE was examined at a higher reaction temperature of 300 ° C. Figure 2b shows InGaAs/InAlAs VNWs with an initial diameter of 35 nm. After 250 cycles of thermal ALE at 300 ° C, the diameters of InGaAs and InAlAs VNWs have decreased to 24 and 4 nm, respectively. The average radial etch rate for the InGaAs VNWs is 0.22 Å/cycle. This etch rate is close to the average etch rate of 0.18 Å/cycle determined by the XRR measurements on a planar InGaAs /uniFB01 lm that is shown in Figure 2c (0.21 Å/cycle for the /uniFB01 rst 200 cycles, and 0.16 Å/cycle for the second 250 cycles).

To understand why the etching of InGaAs VNWs stops at 250 ° C, an XPS study was performed on pristine and thermal ALE-etched planar InGaAs /uniFB01 lms (see Supporting Information). After 300 and 600 cycles of thermal ALE at 250 ° C or 300 cycles at 300 ° C, the In/As ratio remained constant, while the In/Ga ratio decreased. The XPS data suggest the di /uniFB03 culty in GaAs thermal ALE, which is consistent with the more favorable /uniFB02 uorination of InAs ( Δ G ° = -26.8 kcal/mol) than GaAs ( Δ G ° = -17.4 kcal/mol). The di /uniFB03 culty in etching GaAs may result in a Ga-rich layer accumulated on the surface that may reduce the etch rate. If the temperature is not high enough, the etching may eventually stop, as observed at 250 ° C. In addition, the higher etch rate of InGaAs during earlier cycles might have its origin in the relatively fast etching of a damaged layer produced by the RIE patterning process. The damaged initial surface may be easier to remove by thermal ALE.

An interesting observation in Figure 2b is that the VNWs did not collapse after 250 cycles of thermal ALE. The narrowest part of the VNW has a diameter of only 4 nm, with a 70 nm tall InGaAs mushroom-shape head. Thermal ALE is able to produce such delicate VNWs because thermal ALE is a gas-phase process without a wet etchant. In contrast, conventional solution-based self-limiting etching techniques, such as the digital etch, 29 can be destructive to fragile nanostructures.

One of the most important aspects of an etching process is the impact of etching on surface topography. Surface roughness is a critical concern in MOSFETs because surface roughness a /uniFB00 ects both device performance and device-to-

device variability. Thermal ALE and plasma ALE are known to have a smoothening e /uniFB00 ect on roughness on planar surfaces. 9,16 Resulting from its similarity to ALD, thermal ALE is expected to be isotropic on three-dimensional nanostructures. Therefore, thermal ALE is an attractive method to etch FinFETs or nanowire sidewalls to mitigate RIE damage and produce smooth, high-quality surfaces.

particular, can have a signi /uniFB01 cant impact on FinFET performance. 30

Planar and nonplanar surface roughness was investigated after thermal ALE using SEM studies. Figure 3a -d shows SEM images of InGaAs/InAlAs /uniFB01 ns after RIE and subsequent thermal ALE processes. The InGaAs/InAlAs sidewall and InAlAs /uniFB02 oor surface help visualize the resulting roughness. Here, three thermal ALE conditions with HF/DMAC were examined: (1) DMAC pressure, P DMAC = 40 mTorr at 250 ° C; (2) P DMAC = 140 mTorr at 250 ° C; and (3) P DMAC = 40 mTorr at 300 ° C.

In case (1) at lower DMAC pressure and lower temperature, the /uniFB01 n sidewalls become rougher after 250 and 600 cycles. In the cases of (2) or (3), with a higher P DMAC or higher temperature, the quality of the sidewall and planar surfaces signi /uniFB01 cantly improves. Overall, process (3) with the higher temperature of 300 ° C for 250 cycles produces the smoothest /uniFB01 n sidewall and planar surfaces. The higher temperature may help the ligand-exchange reaction to become more self-limiting which may facilitate the smoothening of the initial surface roughness. The SEM images in Figure 3a -d qualitatively show that the /uniFB01 n sidewall roughness produced by the RIE process can be reduced after thermal ALE. Thermal ALE can preserve or possibly improve sidewall quality even after hundreds of cycles. The improvement in /uniFB01 n sidewall roughness, in

Figure 3e,f shows the evolution of surface topography of an InGaAs wafer etched after the same /uniFB01 n RIE process. The surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The initial root mean-square surface roughness, R rms , after RIE is 0.52 nm. Figure 3f shows that the surface topography is preserved after 150 and 200 cycles ( R rms ∼ 0.5 nm). R rms slightly increased to 0.69 nm after 250 cycles of thermal ALE.

The slight increase of R rms after 250 thermal ALE cycles may occur because InGaAs and InAlAs are ternary materials. When they are etched, the surface can su /uniFB00 er from preferential etching of one metal over the other. XPS analysis (see Supporting Information) con /uniFB01 rmed that the In/Ga ratio decreased from 1.0 to 0.8 -0.9 after 600 thermal ALE cycles at 250 -300 ° C as expected from the preferential etching of InAs compared with GaAs. There was also increased Al content perhaps resulting from partial conversion of InGaAs/InAlAs to AlAs during the DMAC reaction.

Having developed InGaAs/InAlAs thermal ALE, the next step was to integrate thermal ALE into a MOSFET fabrication /uniFB02 ow. On the basis of the above observations, thermal ALE o /uniFB00 ers multiple new possibilities in device processing, such as precise and low damage etching. Another important feature of thermal ALE is its potential to be integrated with ALD into an in situ process, which can completely prevent air exposure of the MOS interface.

To illustrate these advantages, a process was developed that is depicted in Figure 4a. The InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure

was /uniFB01 rst patterned and dry etched into /uniFB01 ns with a minimum W f = 24 nm. Subsequently, the HSQ hardmask was removed by BOE etch, and the /uniFB01 ns were etched by alcohol-based digital etch for eight cycles, using O2 plasma and 0.1 M HCl:IPA. This process had an etch rate of 1.0 nm/cycle. 29 The digital etch process helps to decreases the initial /uniFB01 n width. This step is not necessary when a completely dry process is desired and accessible.

was revealed, suggesting a lower etch rate on [111] plane. This is reasonable because the {111} planes have the highest packing density. Slower etch rates have indeed been observed at higher packing density surfaces in the chemical etching of Si and GaAs by Cl2. 31,32

Next, the InGaAs /uniFB01 ns were etched by thermal ALE with HF/DMAC for 250 cycles at 300 ° C. Note that for very narrow /uniFB01 ns, the thermal ALE released the InGaAs /uniFB01 ns by undercutting the InAlAs bu /uniFB00 er layer due to the selectivity of thermal ALE. Following thermal ALE, the InGaAs /uniFB01 ns were covered by 4.7 nm of Al2O3 and 20 nm of W by ALD. The thermal ALE and Al2O3 ALD were performed in situ in the same reactor. The undercutting of the InAlAs bu /uniFB00 er layer resulted in a gate-all-around (GAA) structure.

Figure 4b -i shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section images of the fabricated InGaAs /uniFB01 n with /uniFB01 n widths W f = 43 -3 nm. The /uniFB01 nal /uniFB01 n widths were consistent with the previous assessment of the etch rate. The InGaAs /uniFB01 ns were released when the /uniFB01 nal W f was &lt;20 nm as shown in Figure 4f -i.

Etching of InAlAs was found to be orientation-dependent, as shown in Figure 4j, which is a close-up image of the InGaAs/ InAlAs interface in Figure 4e. For these samples, the wafer orientation is [001] and the /uniFB01 n sidewall orientation is [011]. After thermal ALE, the InAlAs [111] plane underneath InGaAs

Figure 4k shows a close-up TEM image of Figure 4i, the narrowest /uniFB01 n with W f = 3 nm in the upper part and W f = 4 nm in the middle. For comparison, a TEM image of an earlier InGaAs FinFET ( W f = 5 nm) is also shown. 7 This device was fabricated using the same heterostructure with the /uniFB01 ns formed by RIE and digital etch. A much sharper MOS interface is obtained by the in situ thermal ALE-ALD process, illustrating the unique advantage of preventing oxidation of the MOS interface.

Lastly, and in an e /uniFB00 ort to demonstrate active device worthiness, the in situ thermal ALE-ALD technique was integrated in a complete InGaAs n-channel FinFET process /uniFB02 ow. Figure 5a shows the starting MBE heterostructure. The channel consisted of 50 nm of In 0.53 Ga0.47 As on top of a Si δ -doping layer of 5 nm ( N d = 4 × 10 12 cm -2 ). The capping layer was 30 nm n + In0.53 Ga0.47 As ( N d = 3 × 10 19 cm -3 ) on a 4 nm InP etch stopper. Device fabrication followed an ohmic contact/uniFB01 rst, gate-last, self-aligned /uniFB02 ow. 7

Figure 5b shows schematics of the /uniFB01 nal device along the source-drain and /uniFB01 n cross sections. There is an undercut below the channel made by thermal ALE. The FinFETs have an inverted trigate geometry because the HSQ hardmask remained in the /uniFB01 nal device. The ohmic contact was a Mo/

Wrefractory contact, 33 and the MOS gate stack consisted of 3 nm HfO2 (e /uniFB00 ective oxide thickness, EOT ≈ 0.8 nm) and 30 nm W, both deposited by ALD. Prior to MOS stack formation, 162 cycles of thermal ALE with HF/DMAC were performed at 300 ° C with P DMAC = 40 mTorr. W f and L g in the /uniFB01 nished devices were measured by TEM and SEM, respectively. Final W f ranged from 2.5 to 18 nm, and the minimum gate length L g was 60 nm.

Figure 5c shows TEM images of the narrowest FinFET with W f = 2.5 nm, which corresponds to a /uniFB01 n aspect ratio (AR = H f / W f ) of 20. Figure 5d,e shows output and subthreshold characteristics, respectively, normalized to the total gate periphery (2 H c + W f ) of the most scaled FinFET with W f = 2.5 nm and L g = 60 nm. The device exhibited well-behaved MOSFET characteristics with nearly ideal linear ( V DS = 50 mV) and saturation ( V DS = 0.5 V) subthreshold swing, S lin and S sat , of 62 and 68 mV/dec, respectively. DIBL of this device was 40 mV/V. The o /uniFB00 -state current was dominated by the gate leakage current. A peak transconductance of g m = 850 μ S/ μ m was achieved at V DS = 0.5 V. More details of the process and electrical characteristics can be found in the 2018 IEDM conference proceedings. 34

Figure 5f benchmarks the maximum g m as a function of W f for InGaAs FinFETs as well as state-of-the-art Si FinFETs. Among the InGaAs FinFETs, the devices in this paper are the most aggressively scaled in the width dimension. In addition to the results listed above for W f = 2.5 nm, the InGaAs FinFET in this paper demonstrated a record g m at W f below 20 nm ( g m,max = 1.9 mS/ μ mat V DS = 0.5 V, W f = 18 nm, L g = 60 nm). The g m of the InGaAs FinFETs around W f = 7 nm also approaches that of the second generation Si FinFETs 35 despite a lower V DD = 0.5 V and longer L g = 60 nm ( V DD = 0.7 V and L g ≈ 20 nm for Si FinFETs). These results highlight the great potential of this novel technique for future generations of CMOS technology and other device applications.

In summary, a thermal ALE process to etch ternary III -V compound semiconductors, such as InGaAs and InAlAs, with atomic-level precision has been presented. Several process conditions were investigated and the best thermal ALE was obtained using HF as the /uniFB02 uorination reactant and DMAC as the ligand-exchange reactant. Thermal ALE was performed on planar substrates and nonplanar nanostructures. The etching rate and the resulting surface roughness exhibited temperature dependence. Optimized etching was achieved with a DMAC pressure of 40 mTorr and a reaction temperature of 300 ° C. The average radial etch rates over 250 cycles for InGaAs and InAlAs VNWs were 0.24 and 0.62 Å/cycle, respectively. The surface quality was maintained after 200 ALE cycles.

A device fabrication process was also developed based on a novel in situ thermal ALE-ALD process. GAA /uniFB01 n structures were fabricated with a minimal W f = 3 nm. Thermal ALE on InGaAs/InAlAs /uniFB01 ns exhibited orientation-dependent etching. Thermal ALE also produced a much sharper MOS interface, compared with previous generations of FinFETs made without the new technique. Lastly, thermal ALE was integrated into an n-channel InGaAs FinFET process and led to the successful demonstration of a transistor. Using combined in situ thermal ALE and ALD, the most aggressively scaled InGaAs FinFETs to date were fabricated with minimum W f as narrow as 2.5 nm. The electrical characteristics of the FinFETs indicated that thermal ALE yields excellent device performance and electrostatic control.

As an early device-level study of this technique, there is still much to understand about the thermal ALE process. Future research is required to verify the detailed reaction mechanisms of III -V thermal ALE, and the resulting surface stoichiometry. A more extensive exploration of process conditions is also needed to optimize thermal ALE. In conclusion, this work proves the concept of applying thermal ALE, one of the most advanced etching techniques today, to fabricate future generations of CMOS devices with unprecedented control at the atomic scale.
