CONSPECTUS: Atomic layer control of semiconductor processing is needed as critical dimensions are progressively reduced below the 10 nm scale. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods are meeting this challenge and produce conformal thin /uniFB01 lm growth on high aspect ratio features. Atomic layer etching (ALE) techniques are also required that can remove material with atomic layer precision. ALE processes are de /uniFB01 ned using sequential, self-limiting reactions based on surface modi cation and volatile release. Plasma ALE methods employ energetic ion or /uniFB01 neutral species to release the modi /uniFB01 ed material anisotropically using sputtering. In contrast, thermal ALE processes utilize gas species to release the modi /uniFB01 ed material isotropically using thermal reactions. Thermal ALE can be viewed as the ' reverse of ALD . '

There are a number of mechanisms for thermal ALE that have developed over the last /uniFB01 ve years. This Account will /uniFB01 rst examine the /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange mechanism for thermal ALE. This mechanism is applicable for many metal oxide and metal nitride materials. Subsequently, the ' conversion etch ' mechanisms will be explored that are derived from the conversion of the surface of the substrate to a new material. The ' conversion etch ' mechanisms are needed when the initial material does not have a viable etching pathway via /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange or when the material has a volatile /uniFB02 uoride. The thermal ALE mechanisms founded on either oxidation or halogenation of the initial substrate will then be examined with an emphasis on metal thermal ALE. Lastly, thermal ALE mechanisms will be considered that are based on self-limiting surface ligands or temperature modulation mechanisms. These various mechanisms o /uniFB00 er a wide range of pathways to remove material isotropically with atomic layer control.

Thermal ALE will be required to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices. This fabrication will increasingly occur beyond the limits of lithography and will extend into the third dimension. The situation is like Manhattan during the advent of skyscrapers. When there was no more room on the ground, building started to move to the third dimension. Three-dimensional devices require a sequential series of deposition and etching steps to build the skyscraper structures. Some etching needs to be vertical and anisotropic to make the elevator shafts. Other etching needs to be horizontal and isotropic to form the hallways. The mechanisms of thermal ALE will be critical for the de /uniFB01 nition of isotropic ALE processes.

Reaching beyond the limits of lithography will also increase the need for maskless processing. The mechanisms of thermal ALE lead to strategies for selective etching of one material in the presence of many materials. In addition, area-selective deposition can bene /uniFB01 t from the ability of thermal ALE to enhance deposition on the desired growth surfaces by removing deposition from other surrounding surfaces. Looking ahead, thermal ALE will continue to provide unique capabilities and will grow in importance as a nanofabrication processing technique.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

With continued miniaturization, atomic layer processing is increasingly important for nanofabrication. There is a need for atomic layer control for both deposition and removal of material. Sequential, self-limiting surface reactions provide the foundation for atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atomic layer etching (ALE). ALD is a well-established technique that underlies semiconductor device fabrication and many other applications. 1 ALE is a relative newcomer that is still in the developmental stage. 2,3

ALE can be subdivided into two categories: plasma ALE 2,4 and thermal ALE. 5 Both plasma and thermal ALE utilize sequential surface modi /uniFB01 cation and removal reactions. Plasma ALE removes surface species with energetic ions or neutral

atoms. 2,4 Because of the directionality of the energetic ions and neutral atoms, plasma ALE yields anisotropic etching that is needed to fabricate high aspect ratio features. 2 In contrast, the randomness of gas species and the self-limiting nature of thermal ALE reactions produce isotropic and conformal etching. 6,7

Thermal ALE can be viewed as the reverse of ALD. 1,8 Both thermal ALE and ALD rely on binary surface reaction sequences.

A schematic for thermal ALE based on surface modi /uniFB01 cation and volatilization reactions is shown in Figure 1. The /uniFB01 rst surface

modi cation reaction /uniFB01 produces an altered surface layer. The second reaction then liberates volatile etch products from this altered surface layer. Ideally, both of these surface reactions are self-limiting. The repetition of these surface modi /uniFB01 cation and volatilization reactions de /uniFB01 nes the thermal ALE process.

This Account considers the mechanisms of ALE processes that are only dependent on temperature or involve thermal annealing. ALE processes that involve ions or energetic neutral atoms for the volatile release process are not considered in this survey. Some plasma processes that are utilized only for surface modi cation /uniFB01 are included in this Account. The goal is to introduce the many possible pathways for thermal ALE and to inspire the development of new mechanisms.

## 2. FLUORINATION AND LIGAND-EXCHANGE MECHANISM

The main thermal ALE mechanism for metal oxides is based on /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. 9 Fluorination is the surface modi /uniFB01 cation reaction. Fluorination is thermochemically favorable because most metal /uniFB02 uorides are more stable than their corresponding metal oxides. 9 One di /uniFB03 culty with /uniFB02 uorination is that some metal /uniFB02 uorides are volatile. These metal oxides require a di /uniFB00 erent thermal ALE mechanism.

Ligand-exchange is the reaction that volatilizes the modi /uniFB01 ed surface. Ligand-exchange is a metal-exchange transmetalation reaction between adjacent metal centers. 10,11 Ligand-exchange reactions are useful to replace /uniFB02 uorine in the metal /uniFB02 uoride with ligands that break the strong metal -/uniFB02 uorine -metal bridge bonding that stabilizes the metal /uniFB02 uoride. 12 This ligand replacement leads to volatile complexes that can desorb from the surface.

## 2.1. Thermal Al2O3 ALE

The /uniFB01 rst /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reaction utilized HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants for Al2 O3 ALE. 5 The original intent of using these reactants was to grow SnF 2 by an ALD process on an Al2O3 ALD surface. However, these reactions were observed to etch the Al2 O3 instead of depositing SnF . 2 5 Figure 2 shows quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) results that observed the linear loss of mass versus number of Al O 2 3 ALE cycles at 200 ° C. The mass loss of -8.4 ng/(cm 2 cycle) is

equivalent to an etch rate of 0.28 Å/cycle. 5 These results suggested that a new class of reactions similar to the ' reverse of ALD was possible to remove material. '

Subsequent studies explored the mechanism of Al2O3 ALE with HF and Sn(acac)2. 13 These investigations identi /uniFB01 ed the growth of surface /uniFB02 uoride and loss of Al2 O3 during the HF exposure. Likewise, the loss of surface /uniFB02 uoride was monitored during the Sn(acac) 2 exposure. 13 The ligand-exchange reaction transfers acac ligands to the AlF3 surface layer. Presumably, SnF(acac) remains volatile after the ligand-exchange reaction. The Al species probably become volatile as AlF(acac)2 or Al(acac)3 after multiple ligand-exchange reactions or redistribution of acac ligands on the surface.

Additional studies explored other precursors for the ligandexchange reaction. Trimethylaluminum (TMA) was observed to etch Al2 O3 together with HF for the /uniFB02 uorination reaction. 14 These results were remarkable because TMA is the main precursor for Al O 2 3 ALD using H2O as the oxygen precursor. 15 With only the change of H O to HF, the TMA reactant can etch 2 Al2 O3. The ligand-exchange reaction between TMA and AlF3 is shown in Figure 3. This reaction produces AlF(CH3)2

(dimethylaluminum /uniFB02 uoride, DMAF) from the TMA reactant. 6,14 In addition, AlF(CH3)2 may also be the volatile etch product from the AlF3 surface after two ligand-exchange reactions or redistribution of CH 3 ligands on the surface. 6

The overall reaction for Al O 2 3 ALEusing HF and TMA can be written as

$$\text{Al} _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + 6 \text{HF} + 4 \text{Al} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \to 6 \text{AlF} ( \text{CH} _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } + 3 \text{H} _ { 2 } O \quad \text{A} \\ ( 1 ) \quad \text{Al} _ { 2 } C \text{A} \quad \text{A} \quad \text{A} \quad \text{A} \quad \text{A}$$

This reaction can be divided into individual HF and TMA reactions: 14

$$( A ) A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ^ { * } + 6 H F \to A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | 2 A l F _ { 3 } ^ { * } + 3 H _ { 2 } O \quad ( 2 ) \quad \text{cycl}$$

$$( B ) A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } | 2 A l F _ { 3 } ^ { * } + 4 A l ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } \to A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ^ { * } + 6 A l F ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } \quad \text{that} \\ ( 3 ) \quad \text{The}$$

The Al2O3 that is etched during the ALE reactions is designated by Al2O3 * . The asterisks indicate the surface species and the vertical lines separate the various species. A schematic for Al O 2 3 ALE is also displayed in Figure 4.

Mass spectrometry studies con /uniFB01 rmed the presence of AlF(CH3)2 etch products. 6 However, DMAF was observed as the dimer of DMAF with itself (DMAF/DMAF) or with TMA (DMAF/TMA). 6 These dimers are favored because of strong bridge bonding between /uniFB02 uorine and the Al metal centers. Fluorine forms stronger bridge bonds between the Al metal centers than CH3. 6 Knowledge of the bridge bonding strengths suggests that /uniFB02 uorine forms bridge bonds in the dimers and CH 3 ligands are in the terminal positions. The terminal CH 3 ligands facilitate desorption of the dimer from the surface. 6

Temperature also was a key variable for Al O 2 3 ALE. The HF and TMA reactants led to Al O3 2 ALE at &gt;250 ° C. 14,16 The etch rates were progressively larger at higher temperatures where the sequential reactant exposures yield etching by /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange. 14 The HF and TMA reactants could also produce AlF3 ALD at T &lt; 250 ° C where the sequential reactant exposures led to metal /uniFB02 uoride growth by an ALD process. 16 Competition between Al2 O3 ALE and AlF3 ALD was also observed in studies on SiO 2 nanoparticles. 17

There is also competition between Al2 O3 ALE and AlF3 growth when using HF and TMA as the reactants during rapid Al2 O3 ALE. 18 For rapid Al O 2 3 ALE, there is no purge time, and the HF and TMA exposures overlap in time and produce AlF3 CVD. 18 The subsequent TMA exposure outside of the overlap with HF is then able to spontaneously etch AlF3. 16 After removing the AlF3 CVDlayer, TMA can proceed to remove the AlF3 layer on the surface of the Al2 O3 substrate. The spontaneous etch of AlF3 by TMA allows rapid Al2O3 ALE to be performed with a short cycle time without a purge.

Additional experimental studies explored the /uniFB02 uorination of Al2 O3 by HF. 19 Higher HF pressure increased the Al2 O3 /uniFB02 uorination and the Al O3 2 etch rate. Fluoride thicknesses up to 5 -6 Å were measured for higher HF pressures of 4 -8 Torr. 19 These high HF pressures yielded Al2O3 etch rates of ∼ 2.5 Å/ cycle at 300 ° C. 19 Theoretical studies have also examined the /uniFB02 uorination of Θ -Al O3 2 by HF. 20 These investigations revealed that a self-limiting /uniFB02 uoride coverage is obtained on Θ -Al O3. 2 The experimental studies were consistent with a /uniFB02 uoride composition of Al OF4. 2 19

## 2.2. Other Materials, Reactants, and E /uniFB00 ect of Film Structure

The /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange mechanism is applicable for many other metal oxides including HfO 2 and ZrO2. 7,21,22 In addition to Sn(acac)2 and TMA, many di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors such as AlCl(CH3)2 (dimethylaluminum chloride (DMAC)), SiCl4 and TiCl4, have been e /uniFB00 ective for the ligandexchange reaction. 7,22,23 These metal precursors provide various ligands, such as acac, CH , and Cl. Di 3 /uniFB00 erent degrees of etching selectivity are derived from these ligands.

Etching selectivity results for TMA are shown in Figure 5a. 23 Together with HF for /uniFB02 uorination, TMA is able to etch Al O 2 3

and HfO2. However, TMA is not able to etch TiN, ZrO2, SiO2, or Si N . Al O 3 4 2 3 is able to etch because AlF(CH ) 3 2 is a stable and volatile etch product. HfO 2 etches at a lower rate, presumably because possible etch products such as HfF(CH ) 3 3 or Hf(CH3)4 are not as stable and volatile as AlF(CH ) . In comparison, ZrO 3 2 2 etches at a negligible rate. The di /uniFB00 erences between HfO2 and ZrO2 are surprising because the properties of Hf and Zr are usually similar. However, Hf(CH3)4 has a higher stability than Zr(CH3)4 and the Hf-CH3 bond energy is larger than the ZrCH3 bond energy. 24,25

Another example of selectivity for DMAC is displayed in Figure 5b. 23 In similarity to the results for TMA in Figure 5a, Al2 O3 and HfO2 are etched by DMAC together with HF for /uniFB02 uorination. These results are anticipated because TMA and DMACboth have CH3 ligands for the ligand-exchange reaction. In addition, DMAC is able to etch ZrO . The ability of DMAC 2 to etch ZrO 2 is believed to be linked to the Cl ligand on DMAC. A ligand-exchange reaction between DMAC and the /uniFB02 uoride layer on ZrO2 can transfer Cl ligands that can form stable and volatile Zr complexes.

Stronger /uniFB02 uoride precursors than HF may be needed for thermochemically favorable /uniFB02 uorination. SF 4 and XeF2 are two stronger /uniFB02 uorination reactants that have been explored for thermal ALE. SF4 was demonstrated for Al2O3 ALE and VO2 ALE. 26 Metal nitrides can also be etched using thermal ALE based on /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. XeF 2 was reported to be necessary for GaN ALE. 27 In contrast, SF 4 and HFwere not successful for GaN ALE. 27 The di /uniFB03 culty in etching GaN may be related to the crystallinity of the GaN /uniFB01 lms. However, AlN ALE was observed for crystalline AlN /uniFB01 lms using HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. 28

The e /uniFB00 ect of /uniFB01 lm crystallinity has been studied for amorphous and crystalline HfO , ZrO , and HfZrO 2 2 4 /uniFB01 lms. 29 Theamorphous /uniFB01 lms all etched faster than the crystalline /uniFB01 lms under the same reaction conditions. HfO2 ALE results for amorphous and crystalline HfO 2 /uniFB01 lms using HF and TiCl 4 as the reactants at 250 ° C are displayed in Figure 6. 29 Crystallinity reduces the etch rate. This reduction may be related to the higher density of the crystalline /uniFB01 lms. Fluorination of the metal oxides results in a

volume expansion. This volume expansion may be easier for the amorphous /uniFB01 lms. 29

## 3. CONVERSION MECHANISMS

Many materials do not have a direct pathway for thermal ALE based on /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. Some metal oxides will form a volatile /uniFB02 uoride and etch spontaneously. Other metal /uniFB02 uorides after /uniFB02 uorination may not easily form stable and volatile etch products with various metal precursors. For example, Figure 5 showed that the TMA and DMAC metal precursors were not able to etch TiN, SiO , or Si N 2 3 4 under the reaction conditions employed at 250 or 300 ° C. 23 These materials do not have accessible pathways to stable and volatile etch products.

One possible strategy for these materials is to use a metal precursor to convert the surface of the original metal oxide to another metal oxide. This conversion process occurs because the original metal oxide is not as stable as the resulting metal oxide. The stability of the metal oxides can be determined by their heats of formation. In addition, Ellingham diagrams or thermochemical calculations can be used to predict the possible conversion of one oxide to another more stable oxide. A metal nitride can also be converted to another more stable nitride.

## 3.1. Conversion, Fluorination, and Ligand-Exchange

The conversion mechanism was initially observed for ZnO ALE using HF and TMA. 30 QCMstudies revealed much larger mass losses during TMA exposures than expected from ligandexchange reactions. These large mass losses suggested that TMA converts the surface of the ZnO substrate to a more stable Al O 2 3 surface layer. The Al O 2 3 surface layer can then be /uniFB02 uorinated and subsequently removed by the TMA ligand-exchange reaction. The TMA can continue to convert the underlying ZnO surface to Al2O3. A schematic illustrating the ZnO ALE surface chemistry via the conversion, /uniFB02 uorination, and ligandexchange mechanism is shown in Figure 7. 30

Another example of the conversion, /uniFB02 uorination, and ligandexchange mechanism is thermal SiO2 ALE using HF and TMA. 31 TMA is able to convert the surface of SiO 2 to Al O3. 2 This conversion process requires higher pressures of TMA than the TMA pressures of ∼ 40 mTorr that were utilized in the TMA results shown in Figure 5a. 23 At reactant pressures of 1.0 and 4.0 Torr, SiO 2 etch rates were 0.18 and 0.27 Å/cycle, respectively. 31 Corresponding Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy

studies con /uniFB01 rmed the conversion of Si -O stretching vibrations to Al -O stretching vibrations. The FTIR investigations also observed greater conversion at higher reactant pressures. A schematic of thermal SiO2 ALE via conversion to Al2 O3 or aluminum oxide silicate is shown in Figure 8. 31

## 3.2. Conversion and Fluorination to Volatile Fluoride

Another class of conversion reactions produce metal oxides that spontaneously etch to produce volatile /uniFB02 uorides after /uniFB02 uorination. These conversion reactions readily lead to pathways for thermal ALE. One useful reactant for conversion and /uniFB02 uorination to a volatile /uniFB02 uoride is BCl3. BCl3 can convert metal oxides to B O 2 3 because B2O3 is a very stable metal oxide. In addition, B O 2 3 can be etched spontaneously using HF. 32 The spontaneous etch products are believed to be BF 3 and B(OH)F2.

WO3ALEusingBCl3 and HF is an example of an ALE process that may occur via conversion and /uniFB02 uorination to a volatile /uniFB02 uoride. The proposed mechanism for WO3 ALE is shown in Figure 9. 32 The surface of WO3 is /uniFB01 rst converted to a B2O3 surface layer by BCl 3 exposure. Subsequently, the B O 2 3 surface layer is spontaneously etched by HF. The underlying WO 3 is not spontaneously etched by HF and serves as an etch stop. Mass spectrometry studies are needed to con /uniFB01 rm this etching mechanism.

## 4. OXIDATION MECHANISMS

Oxidation is a useful step for many thermal ALE pathways. Oxidation changes the oxidation number of the element that maybecritical to obtain the correct oxidation state for the stable, volatile etch product. Oxidation can oxidize elemental metals to metal oxides. Elemental metals have an oxidation state of zero. Manyvolatile metal etch products have the metal oxidation state

in 2+, 3+, or 4+. Oxidation can also convert metal nitrides to metal oxides. Many metal nitrides have the metal in the 3+ oxidation state. However, many stable etch products require the metal in the 4+ oxidation state.

## 4.1. Oxidation and Fluorination to Volatile Fluoride

TiN ALE using O3 and HF as the reactants is an example of oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination to a volatile /uniFB02 uoride. 33 The oxidation state of Ti in TiN is 3+. The oxidation state for most stable volatile Ti complexes is 4+. TiN can be oxidized to TiO 2 using ozone. This oxidation converts the Ti oxidation state to 4+. After the oxidation of TiN to TiO2, the TiO2 surface layer can be spontaneously etched using HF. A schematic of TiN ALE is displayed in Figure 10. 33 TiN etch rates of 0.2 Å/cycle were measured at 250 ° C. The TiN etch rate was also self-limiting versus O3 and HF exposure times. 33

WALEusingO2 and WF6 is another example of oxidation and /uniFB02 uorination to a volatile /uniFB02 uoride. 34 For W ALE, the W surface is /uniFB01 rst oxidized to WO3 using O2. This oxidation changes the oxidation state of W from 0 to 6+. Subsequently, WF 6 is able to etch the WO3 surface layer by forming volatile WO F x y species. This W ALE procedure is consistent with previous studies where WF6 was observed to spontaneously etch WO3 at &gt;180 ° C during WO3 ALD. 35,36

## 4.2. Oxidation, Conversion, Fluorination, and Ligand-Exchange

Oxidation can also be used together with conversion to de /uniFB01 ne other thermal ALE mechanisms. The oxidation and conversion pathway is critical to de /uniFB01 ne thermal Si ALE. 37 For thermal Si ALE, Si is /uniFB01 rst oxidized to produce a surface SiO2 layer. Subsequently, the surface SiO 2 layer is converted to Al O 2 3 or an aluminum oxide silicate using TMA at higher pressures as discussed in Section 3.1. The Al O 2 3 or aluminum oxide silicate is then removed by /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions as discussed in Section 2.1. A schematic for thermal Si ALE is shown in Figure 11. 37

Figure 11. Schematic for Si ALE using O2, HF, and Al(CH3)3. O2 oxidizes Si to SiO . HF converts the top Al O 2 2 3 layer to AlF . Al(CH ) 3 3 3 removes the AlF3 surface layer by a ligand-exchange reaction and then converts SiO2 to Al2 O3. Reproduced with permission from ref 37. Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

Results for Si ALE based on spectroscopic ellipsometry studies are displayed in Figure 12. 37 Si ALE using a O , HF, and 2 TMA reaction sequence yields a Si etch rate of 0.4 Å/cycle at 290 ° C. 37 The ellipsometric investigations also monitor a SiO 2 layer with a thickness of ∼ 11 Å that exists on the Si surface during Si ALE. This SiO 2 layer is continuously formed from Si oxidation and then converted to an Al O 2 3 or aluminum oxide silicate surface layer by the TMA exposure prior to removal by /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions.

Si N4 3 ALE can also be accomplished using the oxidation, conversion, /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange mechanism. 38 Because Si N4 3 is more di /uniFB03 cult to oxidize than Si, O3 is preferable to O 2 for the oxidation reaction. Similar etch rates are measured for Si N 3 4 ALE and Si ALE under comparable reaction conditions with O3 as the oxidant for Si N 3 4 ALE and O2 as the oxidant for Si ALE. A Si3N4 etch rate of 0.47 Å/cycle was measured at 290 ° C using an O3 -HF -TMA reactant sequence. 38

## 4.3. Oxidation, Conversion, and Fluorination to Volatile Fluoride

Oxidation can also be combined with conversion and /uniFB02 uorination to a volatile /uniFB02 uoride to de /uniFB01 ne another thermal ALE mechanism. This pathway was utilized for thermal W ALE. 32 The W substrate was /uniFB01 rst oxidized using ozone to form a

WO3 surface layer. The WO3 surface layer was then removed using BCl3 and HF as the reactants as discussed in Section 3.2. BCl3 converts the WO3 surface layer to a B O 2 3 surface layer. HF can then spontaneously etch the B O 2 3 surface layer. A schematic showing this three-step process is given in Figure 13. 32

In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements monitored both the WO3 surface layer and the underlying W /uniFB01 lm thickness during W ALE. Figure 14 shows the WO3 and W thicknesses during W ALE at 207 ° C. 32 The WO3 thickness displayed in Figure 14a oscillates as the WO 3 layer is increased in thickness by O3 exposures and then etched by BCl /HF exposures. While 3 the WO3 thickness is oscillating, the underlying W /uniFB01 lm thickness decreases linearly as W is progressively converted into WO . The 3 results in Figure 14b yield a W etch rate of 2.44 Å/cycle. 32 Additional experiments determined that the individual O , BCl , 3 3 and HF exposures were self-limiting. 32

## 4.4. Oxidation and Ligand Volatilization

Oxidation is critical for thermal metal ALE. Oxidation increases the oxidation state of the metal. Subsequently, various ligands can extract the oxidized metal and produce a metal complex that is both stable and volatile. Copper thermal ALE is an example of this mechanism using oxidation with O 2 or O3 to increase the Cu oxidation number and yield Cu2O or CuO, respectively. 39 The Cu2O is then believed to interact with hexa /uniFB02 uoroacetylacetone (hfacH) in a disproportionation reaction to form volatile Cu(hfac)2 and elemental Cu. 39 This process produced an etch rate of 0.9 Å/cycle at 275 ° C. 39 Alternatively, the CuO is thought to interact with hfacH to produce Cu(hfac) 2 and H2O. 39 This process yielded an etch rate of 84 Å/cycle at 275 ° C. 39

Metal ALE using oxidation and ligand volatilization has also been performed using an O2 plasma to oxidize the metal. Fe, Cu, Co, Pd, and Pt have been oxidized using an O 2 plasma to change the oxidation state of the metal. 40 Subsequently, the metal oxide has been removed using various organic ligands such as formic acid. 40 Themetal etch rates varied from 5 Å/cycle for Pt to 42 Å/ cycle for Fe. 40 The etch rates also were proportional to the oxide thicknesses produced by the O2 plasma. 40

## 5. HALOGENATION MECHANISMS

Halogenation is another key step for the thermal ALE of metals. Like oxidation, halogenation changes the oxidation state of the metal. This change may be necessary for the metal to obtain the correct oxidation state to yield stable, volatile etch products. The metal complexes will have an oxidation state determined by the number of halide ligands. In addition, the metal complexes will also contain additional two-electron donor ligands to obey the ' 18 electron rule ' or ' 16 electron rule . ' 41

Guidelines to determine stable metal complexes are given by the Covalent Bond Classi /uniFB01 cation (CBC) method. 42 X ligands are one-electron donors such as halogens like Cl. L ligands are two-electron donors like PR 3 or NR3. The stable metal complex has an initial number of d-electrons. The metal will add electrons by binding X and L ligands to obtain 18 or 16 electrons in its outer shell. 42 For example, Ni has 10 d-electrons, and Ni complexes typically have NiX L 2 3 or NiX2L2 con /uniFB01 gurations. One approach for Ni ALE is to create volatile nickel compounds that are either NiX2L3 or NiX2L2 formed by sequential surface reactions.

## 5.1. Halogenation and Ligand Volatilization

Halogenation followed by ligand exposure has been demonstrated for Co ALE. 43 The pathway to volatilization involved chlorination using Cl2 to form CoCl x surface species. The oxidation state of cobalt was increased by chlorination. Subsequently, hfacH exposures are believed to extract the oxidized Co species by forming Co(hfac) Cl x y volatile complexes. A schematic showing this halogenation and ligand volatilization process is given in Figure 15. 43 Co etch rates were determined

using scanning electron microscopy of Co /uniFB01 lm cross sections before and after Co ALE. The Co etch rates varied from 2 Å/ cycle at 140 ° C to 16 Å/cycle at 185 ° C. 43

## 5.2. Chlorine/Fluorine Ligand Exchange

Halogenation is also an e /uniFB00 ective mechanism for thermal ALE if the /uniFB02 uorides and chlorides of materials have di /uniFB00 erent volatilities. In the /uniFB01 rst step, a self-limiting /uniFB02 uorination process can be used to form a stable /uniFB02 uoride layer on the substrate. In the second step, a chlorine/ /uniFB02 uorine ligand-exchange process can be employed to yield volatile chloride species. This chlorine/ /uniFB02 uorine ligandexchange mechanism was utilized to de /uniFB01 ne TiO2 ALE with WF6 and BCl3 as the reactants. 44 The TiO2 ALE process was viable at temperatures ≤ 170 ° C because the /uniFB02 uoride is stable but the chloride is volatile. 44 A TiO2 etch rate of ∼ 0.6 Å/cycle was observed at 170 ° C. In contrast, TiO 2 was etched spontaneously by WF6 at higher temperatures because the /uniFB02 uoride is volatile. 44 TiO2 ALE has also been used together with TiO 2 ALD for areaselective TiO 2 ALD. 45

## 6. SELF-LIMITING SURFACE LIGAND MECHANISMS

Some materials are etched by precursors where the buildup of species on the surface from the precursor eventually stops the etching. The species that limit the etching can then be removed by a second precursor to de /uniFB01 ne the ALE process. An example of this self-limiting surface ligand mechanism is AlF3 ALE using Sn(acac)2 and HF as the reactants. 46 Sn(acac)2 can undergo a

ligand-exchange reaction with AlF3. This ligand-exchange reaction is believed to produce volatile SnF(acac) from Sn(acac)2. In addition, the ligand-exchange reaction also yields AlF2(acac) on the surface.

The etching of AlF 3 by Sn(acac)2 is self-limiting and is known to saturate with acac species on the surface. 46 A subsequent HF exposure is required to maintain the AlF 3 ALE process. The HF exposure is thought to lead to the /uniFB02 uorination reaction: AlF2(acac) + HF(g) → AlF3 + acacH(g). This /uniFB02 uorination reaction reforms the AlF3 surface and allows the AlF3 ALE process to continue versus Sn(acac) 2 and HF exposures.

Another related example is ZnO ALE using acetylacetone (acacH) and O2 plasma as the reactants. 47 acacH is proposed to etch ZnO by forming Zn(acac)2 and H2O. However, the ZnO surface also becomes covered by acacH adsorption products that limit the reaction. The subsequent O2 plasma reaction then removes these acacH adsorption products and allows the ZnO ALE to continue versus sequential acacH and O2 plasma exposures. A schematic of the proposed mechanism for ZnO ALE is shown in Figure 16. 47 ZnO etch rates varied from 0.5 to 1.3 Å/cycle at temperatures between 100 and 250 ° C. 47

## 7. TEMPERATURE MODULATION MECHANISMS

Another class of thermal ALE reactions is based on temperature annealing. A surface modi /uniFB01 cation reaction is /uniFB01 rst performed at lower temperature. Subsequently, the surface modi /uniFB01 ed layer is desorbed by heating to higher temperature. The temperature is then returned to the initial temperature to repeat the thermal ALE process.

For example, a thermal modulation mechanism for Si N 3 4 ALE is based on the formation of an (NH ) SiF 4 2 6 layer on the Si N 3 4 surface. 48 This ammonium salt layer can be formed by exposure of a hydro /uniFB02 uorocarbon plasma to the Si N4 3 surface at 20 ° C. Subsequently, the substrate is thermally annealed to 150 ° C to desorb the (NH4)2SiF6 layer. 48 A schematic of Si N 3 4 ALE using this temperature modulation mechanism is shown in Figure 17. 48 This Si N4 3 ALE process produced a Si3N4 etch rate of 16 Å/cycle. 48

A temperature modulation mechanism has also been employed for Si ALE. 49 The Si surface is /uniFB01 rst oxidized to a SiO2 layer using an O 2 plasma. The SiO2 layer is then converted

to an (NH4)2SiF6 layer using a NH /NF3 3 plasma. Subsequently, the substrate is thermal annealed to desorb the ammonium salt layer. 49 In addition, MoS 2 ALE has been performed using an O2 plasma to form an amorphous MoO3 monolayer on the MoS2 surface at 200 ° C. 50 Subsequently, the MoO3 monolayer can be desorbed by thermal annealing to 500 ° C. 50

## 8. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

Thermal ALE has developed rapidly over the last /uniFB01 ve years. The Intel etch group proposed the possibility of thermal ALE using sequential, self-limiting surface reactions in their seminal perspective in 2015. 3 Many materials, including metal oxides and metal nitrides, can now be etched using thermal ALE mechanisms. A current important challenge is the development of thermal ALE mechanisms for metals. Another critical goal for thermal ALE is selectivity between various materials. Many studies have illustrated that the di /uniFB00 erent ligands involved in ligand-exchange reactions can provide pathways for selectivity. 23 Investigations of new ligands for thermal ALE are needed to expand the options for selectivity between di /uniFB00 erent materials. In addition, a deeper understanding of thermal ALE requires spectroscopic analysis of the species formed on the surface and the volatile products released to the gas phase.

Thermal ALE will become increasingly critical for nanofabrication as dimensions continue to shrink and devices become more three-dimensional. A key application for thermal ALEwill be fabrication of advanced devices such as FinFETs and gate-all-around FETs. 51 Plasma ALE and thermal ALE will need to be used together to provide anisotropic and isotropic etching. There also may be possibilities for hybrid approaches where low energy ions may remove self-limiting surface species during thermal ALE. 28 These hybrid approaches may be able to allow thermal ALE to display anisotropic properties similar to those of plasma ALE.
