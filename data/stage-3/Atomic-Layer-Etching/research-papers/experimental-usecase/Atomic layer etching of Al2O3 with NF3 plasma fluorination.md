## ABSTRACT

In this study, a cyclic isotropic plasma atomic layer etching (ALE) process was developed for aluminum oxide that involves fluorination with NF3 plasma and ligand exchange with trimethylaluminum (TMA). The isotropic plasma ALE consists of two steps: fluorination and removal. During the fluorination step, the Al2O3 surface was fluorinated to AlOFx with NF3 plasma at 100 °C. The formation of the AlOFx layer was confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and the atomic fraction of fluorine on the surface was saturated at 25% after 50 s of plasma fluorination. The depths of the fluorinated layers were in the range of 0.79 -1.14 nm at different plasma powers. In the removal step, the fluorinated layer was removed by a ligand exchange reaction with TMA at an elevated temperature range of 250 -480 °C. The etch per cycle (EPC) was 0.20 -0.30 nm/cycle and saturated after 30 s in the temperature range of 290 -330 °C. No etching was observed below 250 °C, and the EPC increased in the temperature range of 250 -300 °C during the removal step with the ligand exchange reaction and reached the maximum at 300 °C. Then, the EPC was significantly reduced at high temperatures, possibly due to TMA decomposition. The fluorine atomic fraction on the surface was reduced to 14% after the removal. In conclusion, Al2O3 was successfully etched at the atomic scale by the cyclic plasma ALE process. The average surface roughness of Al2O3 was reduced from 8.6 to 5.3 Å after 20 cycles of etching.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Over the last several decades, the critical dimensions (CD) of semiconductor devices have reduced as expressed by Moore s law and ' recently reached the nanometer scale. 1 4 -The CD reduction has also induced the thickness reduction of gate silicon dioxide for metal -oxide -semiconductor field-effect transistors and a reduction of the lateral dimensions. 5,6 However, the continuous decrease in SiO2 thickness, approaching the permissible limits, has led to large gate leakage currents. 5,7 -9 High-dielectric constant ( κ ) materials have been adopted to replace SiO2 to enable the thickness reduction by blocking the leakage current at the limited thickness. 6,7,10,11 Highκ materials, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and HfO2, provide the specific capacitance required for the gate dielectric at a considerable thickness with a reduced leakage current of transistors. 10,12,13 Among them, Al2O3 is considered a potential candidate for the blocking oxides in chargetrap flash memory applications owing to its larger bandgap (7 eV) than other highκ materials, such as ZrO2 (4.6 eV) and HfO2 (5.7 eV). 14,15 However, Al2O3 is difficult to etch because of its physical and chemical stabilities and is typically etched by reactive ion etching (RIE). 16 18 -The use of three-dimensional (3D) structures is another miniaturization solution that requires a different etching technology than the conventional methods. 4 The RIE results in anisotropic patterns and, therefore, cannot be applied to make 3D structures that require isotropic etching. 4,19,20 Isotropic atomic layer etching (ALE) technologies are required to fabricate 3D structures with atomic scale dimensions. 20 24 -

Isotropic ALE for Al2O3 is typically carried out by the surface fluorination and removal reactions, which are separated by purge steps. 22,25 -29 The fluorination is typically the first modification step

that converts the surface of Al2O3 to AlF3 using hydrogen fluoride at elevated substrate temperatures. 25,26,30 -32 Al2O3 at the surface is converted into an AlF3 layer by reacting with HF because AlF3 is more thermodynamically stable and reactive than Al2O3. 4,25,26 However, the use of HF should be restricted owing to safety issues related to its highly corrosive nature. 30 Fluorine-containing plasma processing can be an alternative method to replace HF for the fluorination of surfaces. 22,25,30 The high reactivity of plasma can broaden the choice of the fluorinating agent for isotropic ALE. 21,22 The second stage of isotropic ALE comprises the removal step using thermal reactions, such as ligand exchange reactions, to remove the fluorinated surface. 29,30,33 -35 The isotropic plasma ALE for Al2O3 has been previously studied, but not as much as thermal ALE. 22,36 A previous ALE study using plasma was characterized by etch rate and etch profiles. 22 However, the study on fluorination on the surface and that in different depths using plasma fluorination has not been reported yet.

In this study, a cyclic isotropic plasma ALE process was developed for Al2O3 by employing NF3, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and trimethylaluminum (TMA) ligand exchange. The Al2O3 surface was fluorinated to AlOFx with NF3 plasma in the fluorination step, and the fluorinated layer was removed by a ligand exchange process with TMA at elevated temperatures in the removal step. The depth of the fluorinated layer was analyzed for different radio frequency (RF) powers in the fluorination step and etched. Surface analysis was performed after each half cycle. The etch per cycle (EPC), which was dependent on the exposure time of TMA, was saturated at various temperatures. The surface roughness of Al2O3 decreased after the cyclic isotropic plasma ALE process.

## II. EXPERIMENT

A cyclic isotropic plasma ALE was studied in an ICP reactor with halogen lamps surrounding the quartz tube, as shown in Fig. 1(a). RF power was supplied through an inductive coil at 13.56 MHz to generate plasma. Six halogen lamps were used for heating the sample to 480 °C. Al2O3 films that are 50 nm-thick were prepared on a silicon substrate by physical vapor deposition sputtering to study the isotropic plasma ALE. Al2O3 test samples of dimensions 1.5 × 1.5 cm 2 were positioned on 5 × 5 cm 2 Si carrier wafers and placed at the center of the heating lamp.

The isotropic plasma ALE process sequence for Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 1(b). One cycle is composed of two steps: fluorination and removal. The first step in surface fluorination is the conversion reaction of the Al2O3 layer to the AlOFx layer using plasma at 100 °C. The temperature of the fluorination step was maintained at 100 °C for 60 s, and the halogen lamps were turned on to elevate the temperature by 300 °C for 30 s after the fluorination in the first purge step. NF3, at a mass flow rate of 3.0 SCCM was exposed to surface fluorination, and the pressure was maintained at 35 mTorr. The applied RF power source was operated at 10 W for 60 s. The second step, AlOFx layer removal, was achieved by a ligand exchange reaction with TMA at elevated temperatures. The temperature was increased to 300 °C by turning the halogen lamps and the temperature was maintained for 30 s with 50 SCCM TMA and 50 SCCM Ar. After this removal step, the sample was cooled for 180 s in the following purge step before the

temperature reaches 100 °C. These two sequential steps were repeated to etch the Al2O3 layer.

The thickness of the fluorinated layer was measured using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS, IONTOF, TOF-SIMS-5) after the fluorination step. Cs + (1 keV, 40 nA) was used to remove the material forming a 150 × 150 μ m 2 sputter crater, and Bi1 ion (25 keV, 1 pA) was used for elemental analysis. The etch rate of the Al2O3 layer was measured by changing the thickness of the removed Al2O3 layer using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (Ellipso-Technology, Elli-SE-U) before and after the process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250) was used to characterize the chemical bonding structure and surface atomic composition of the Al2O3 surface. High-resolution atomic force microscopy (HR-AFM, JPK Instruments, Nano Wizard Ultra Speed) was used to confirm the surface roughness after etching.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As the first step, Al O3 2 was fluorinated with NF3 plasma, and the surface was analyzed by varying the plasma RF power and processing time. The depths of the fluorinated layers were investigated by SIMS depth profiling at various RF powers, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The F peak increased significantly with the RF power due to highly reactive fluorine radicals generated in the plasma. The fluorinated depth is defined as the depth at which the F intensity drops to 80% of its maximum intensity. 37 The fluorination thickness is not saturated with the RF power, and the increase in the depth of fluorination is attributed to an increase in fluorine radicals generated at high

RF powers. 38,39 A similar phenomenon is observed in the plasma oxidation of silicon. The oxidation thickness increased by plasma power without saturation. 34,40 The fluorination as a function of NF3 plasma processing time was investigated with the F1s peak at the binding energy of 686.3 eV in the XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 2(b). 41 The peak increases with NF3 plasma time up to 50 s and thereafter saturates at an RF power of 10 W. The F1s peak is saturated because the fluorinated layer acts as a diffusion barrier that prevents fluorine from further penetrating the Al2 O3 layer. 22 The atomic surface compositions of Al, O, and F were also plotted as a function of the fluorination time, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The atomic fraction of F increased to 25% and that of O decreased from 38% to 51% after 50 s of NF3 plasma. The decrease in O is caused by the removal of NO or NO2 in the NF3 plasma. 35 All the atomic compositions were saturated after 50 s of NF 3 plasma exposure time, and therefore, the plasma time of 60 s was selected as the standard time for the following fluorination step. The saturation in the fluorination step with NF 3 plasma allows precise control of the etch rate in the ALE process.

As the next step, the chemical composition of the fluorinated layer processed under the 60 s and 10 W conditions was investigated using XPS and SIMS depth profiles, as shown in Fig. 3. Al 2p peak was analyzed for fluorination, and the peak was deconvoluted into three peaks of 74.5, 75.8, and 76.5 eV, representing Al2O3, AlOFx, and AlF3, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(a). 42 The peak area fractions of AlOFx and AlF3 correspond to ∼ 56.7% and ∼ 7.6%, respectively, of the total area. The depth profiles of O, F, Al, AlO, and AlOF were analyzed by SIMS at different sputtering times, as shown in Fig. 3(b). High concentrations of F and AlOF were observed near the surface region, indicating a high degree of fluorination on the surface. The intensity of F increased slightly near the surface and decreased significantly with depth. The low O and AlO fractions near the surface are attributed to the replacement of O by F in the fluorination step. 43

The fluorinated Al2O3 and AlOFx were removed by a ligand exchange reaction with TMA in the next step, and the EPC was studied as a function of the temperature and TMA exposure time as shown in Fig. 4(a). The EPC plateaus after 30 s of TMA exposure at various temperatures, and, therefore, 30 s was selected as the standard TMA exposure time in the subsequent study on the removal step. TMA exposure time in this work is considerably longer than that of HF in previous studies. 21,35,44 -46 We believe that this longer TMA exposure time is attributed to a thicker fluorination depth formed with reactive fluorine radicals. The EPC increased from 0.20 to 0.30 nm/cycle when the temperature was increased from 290 to 300 °C and decreased to 0.27 nm/cycle at 330 °C. The EPC at 300 °C in this work is approximately 2 -7 times higher with plasma fluorination than that with HF. 21,35,44 -46 The saturated EPC at 30 s of TMA processing was plotted over the entire temperature range, as shown in Fig. 4(b). No etching was observed below 250 °C, and the EPC increases at the temperature range of 250 -300 °C. The EPC sharply decreases above 300 °C, and no etching was observed above 480 °C. We analyzed the surface composition with XPS at higher temperature of 280 -480 °C as shown in Fig. 4(c). C1s peaks were fit using C -C at 284.5 eV and C Fx -(x = 1, 2, 3) at 288.7 eV. 47,48 The C1s peaks maintained the similar intensity with and without TMA in the temperature range of 280 -300 °C after first cycle ALE process. The intensities of C -C

and C -Fx peaks increase at the temperature above 300 °C, and the increase of carbon on the surface is believed to be related to the decomposition of TMA at higher temperature. The monomers of TMAwere reported to decompose into dimethyl aluminum, monomethyl aluminum, C2H4, and CH3 at high temperatures in a previous study. 49 The decrease of EPC is attributed to the increased carbon on surface at higher temperature above 300 °C.

The etched depth after each ALE cycle was compared with the depth of the fluorinated layer at RF powers of 10, 50, and 100 W via SIMS depth profiling, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Both the fluorinated depth and etched depth increased with the increasing RF power. However, the etched depth was less than the fluorinated depth, indicating that the fluorinated layers were not completely removed from the surface after the ALE. The ratio of fluorinated layer depth to etched depth was almost constant at 2.6 at each RF power. The atomic compositions of the Al2O3 surface were analyzed at 10 W by XPS and are plotted in Fig. 5(b) after each fluorination and removal

step. The concentration of fluorine was increased by 25% owing to the formation of AlOFx layers on Al2O3 with NF3 plasma in the first fluorination step. The fluorine concentration of the surface dropped to 14% after the reaction with TMA during the first removal step. The concentration of fluorine increased to 25% after the second fluorination step and decreased to 14% after the second removal step. In conclusion, this ALE process removes Al2O3 at the atomic scale, even though the process leaves a fluorine residue on the surface after the plasma ALE process.

The surface roughness of the Al2O3 films were observed by HR-AFM to image and quantify the roughness after the isotropic plasma ALE process, as shown in Fig. 6. As the number of cycles increased, the surface morphology became smooth, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The average roughness of the initial Al2O3 surface was 8.6 Å and increased to 26.6 Å after first fluorination step possibly

due to reorganization into AlOFx layer. 25,50 The lower surface roughness was achieved by a chemical reaction between the fluorinated layer and TMA during the ligand exchange reaction. The average roughness of Al2O3 decreases significantly by 5.3 Å after a 20-cycle process as shown in Fig. 6(b). From the literature, the surface roughness, determined after a thermal ALE process using HF via x-ray reflectivity, decreased from 6.26 to 3.56 Å after 100 cycles of ALE process at 300 °C. 46 This study using plasma for ALE effectively lowers the surface roughness as smoothly as the thermal ALE within only 20 cycles.

## IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A plasma NF3 ALE process for Al2O3 was developed in this study. The depth of the fluorinated layer was confirmed to be 0.79 nm using NF3 plasma at 10 W. The Al2O3 surface was fluorinated to AlOFx with NF3 plasma, and all atomic fractions of this surface were saturated as a function of the NF3 plasma processing time at a fluorine concentration of 25%. The self-limiting characteristics were confirmed at various temperatures and TMA exposure times, and an EPC of 0.30 nm/cycle was achieved at a temperature of 300 °C. After the ALE process, the fluorine concentration of

the surface dropped to 14% after the reaction with TMA. The etched depth at 10 W increased with the increasing RF power and the plasma ALE process demonstrated atomic scale etching even though the surface remained fluorinated. The roughness of the Al2O3 substrate was decreased from 8.6 to 5.3 Å after a 20-cycle ALE process. We demonstrated that the proposed process with the use of plasma is an effective and nondestructive technique for the atomic level etching of 3D structures.
