We investigated the surface reaction of the thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of Al2O3 film using fluorine (F) radicals  and  trimethylaluminum (TMA). As a strong fluorination source to replace HF, we used NF3  remote plasma to generate F radicals without spontaneous or anisotropic etching by ion bombardment. The mass was increased by F radicals and decreased by TMA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that AlF3 and AlOxFy were formed by F radicals, and all AlF3 and a significant portion of AlOxFy were removed by TMA. At 250  C, the etch per cycle (EPC) was fully saturated at 1.58 Å/cycle for the NF3 remote plasma of 4 s and the TMA ◦ pulse  time  of  3  s.  Based  on  the  saturation  behavior,  isotropic  etching  was  demonstrated  for  the  Al2O3 film prepared on a trench pattern. The EPC increased progressively with temperature from 0.1 Å/cycle at 198  C to ◦ 4.2 Å/cycle at 320  C. Since the thickness of the fluorinated layer did not increase significantly with increasing ◦ temperature, the removal step determined the EPC.

## 1. Introduction

To overcome the miniaturization limitations of planar transistors, three-dimensional (3D) devices such as fin field-effect transistors (FETs), nanosheet FETs, and 3D vertical NAND architecture have been introduced [1 -7]. Accordingly, vertical, anisotropic etching and horizontal, isotropic etching are required to fabricate 3D devices [8]. Reactive ion etching (RIE) is currently a common anisotropic etching technique, and wet etching has been used for isotropic etching. However, wet etching is problematic for nanoscale device fabrication because the surface tension of the liquid causes pattern damage [9]. In addition, it is not easy to integrate with subsequent vacuum processes, and the etch rate needs to be controlled at the atomic level.

difference  between  the  two  is  the  directionality.  Plasma  ALE  is  an anisotropic etching process because it uses ion bombardment to form and remove the modified layer. On the other hand, thermal ALE is an isotropic etching process because chemical reactions form and remove a modified layer. Therefore, thermal ALE attracts much attention as the atomic-level isotropic etching process.

The process that can meet all of these requirements is thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) [8,10 -16]. An ALE cycle consists of at least two selflimiting steps, surface modification and removal, separated by purge steps. Therefore, by repeating the ALE cycle, it is possible to precisely etch the desired amount at the atomic level. The ALE process can be divided  into  plasma  ALE  and  thermal  ALE  [8,10,15,16].  The  main

Research on thermal ALE was first reported in 2015 [17,18]. Al2O3 films were etched by alternating fluorination with hydrogen fluoride (HF) and removal with Sn(acac)2. Many metalorganic compounds have been tested as precursors for the removal step [13,17,19 -29], and the thermal  ALE  process  using  HF  and  trimethylaluminum  (TMA)  is  the most popular for Al2O3  [27,30 -34]. However, the use of HF presents several problems. HF is difficult to handle, and equipment maintenance is problematic because it is toxic and corrosive. In addition, HF is a weak fluorination source [34], which would increase the ALE processing time. Therefore,  looking  for  other  fluorination  sources  to  replace  HF  is necessary.

Recently,  SF6 plasma  was  introduced  to  utilize  F  radicals  in  the modification  step  [35].  Because  the  reactivity  of  the  F  radicals  is

stronger than HF, the use of SF6 plasma has improved the etch per cycle (EPC). However, because SF6  plasma generates ions such as SF5 , ion + bombardment and sulfur contamination are concerns. SF4 was used as a fluorination source and showed better reactivity than HF, but it also has sulfur contamination issues [34]. NF3  has a higher decomposition rate than SF6 in plasma [36], resulting in a higher concentration of F radicals. In  addition,  N  radicals  recombine  rapidly  to  form  N2,  leaving  no  N residues on the surface. An ALE study using NF3  ICP plasma was reported, but the detailed surface reaction of the process has not been reported [37].

In this study, we investigated the surface reaction during the ALE Al2O3  process using the F radicals as the fluorination source. We used NF3 remote  plasma  to  generate  F  radicals  without  spontaneous  or anisotropic etching by ion bombardment. TMA was used as the removal precursor. The fluorination and removal steps were repeated at the same temperature, and the self-limiting behavior of each step was confirmed, resulting  in  isotropic  etching.  The  surface  reaction  was  analyzed  by changes in mass and composition for each half cycle.

## 2. Experimental

The ALE process of Al2O3 was studied in a reactor equipped with a remote  plasma  generator  and  an  in  situ  quartz  crystal  microbalance (QCM). The radicals were generated by the remote plasma generator (Litmas RPS 1501, ADVANCED ENERGY, USA), and the plasma power was set to 350 W. The etching process was monitored by the QCM system with a GaPO4 crystal resonator (R-30, Piezocryst, Germany). The details of the QCM measurements are reported elsewhere [38]. The susceptor was coated with Y2O3. 600 sccm of Ar (99.999 %) gas was continuously fed into the reactor, and the working pressure was maintained at 1 Torr. For the modification step, the remote plasma was ignited using only Ar gas, and then 20 sccm of NF3 gas (99.99 %, Korea Noble Gas Co., Ltd.) was added after 3 s. After the addition of NF3, there was a delay of more than 1 s before F radicals entered the chamber. For the removal step, TMA (99.99 %, Hansol Chemical Co.) was injected into the reactor. The modification and removal steps were separated by a 10 s pumping step and a 100 s Ar purging step.

The ALD Al2O3 thin films for etching were prepared on silicon wafers and GaPO4  crystal sensors by alternating exposure to TMA and O3  at 250 ◦ C. The thickness of the etched Al2O3  films was measured by an ellipsometer (Elli-SE, Ellipso Technology, Republic of Korea) and then confirmed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100F HR, JEOL Ltd., Japan; Tecnai Osiris, FEI Company, USA). The etching profile of the film was also observed by TEM. The chemical bonding of the surface species after the etching was analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system (Nexsa, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using a monochromatic Al K α (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with a beam size of 400 μ m × 400 μ m. The binding energy was calibrated to carbon C1s peak at 284.8 eV of adventitious carbon [39,40]. The baseline was corrected using the PeakFit 4.12 software (Jandel, Scientific Software) with zero second derivative condition. The deconvolution was performed based on the Gaussian function rule, and the R 2 values of the curve fitting were higher than 0.99. The fluorinated layer thickness was determined  by  time-of-flight  secondary  ion  mass  spectroscopy  (ToFSIMS; M6, IONTOF GmbH, Germany). The Cs + ion (1 keV, ~106nA) was used for the sputtering of the films, and the Bi + ion (30 keV, ~1.31 pA) was used for the analysis.

## 3. Results and discussion

First, the mass change was measured by QCM during the ALE process at 250  C. An ALE cycle consisted of 4 s of NF3 remote plasma and 3 s of ◦ TMA pulse, separated by Ar purges. Fig. 1 (a) shows the mass change during the first 30 ALE cycles. An almost linear behavior was observed from the beginning of the process. The average mass change per cycle (MCPC) was obtained from the slope of the graph. Fig. 1 (b) shows the

Fig. 1. Mass change as a function of processing time (a) during the first 30 ALE cycles and (b) during an ALE cycle. The wafer temperature was 250  C, and the ◦ ALE cycle consisted of an NF3  remote plasma, a purge, a TMA pulse, and a purge. Δ MAl2O3  indicates the mass loss by an ALE cycle. Δ MNF3  and Δ MTMA denote the mass change by NF3 remote plasma and TMA pulse, respectively.

mass change during an ALE cycle. The sudden mass change observed after the introduction of F radicals or TMA, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), is the apparent mass change resulting from the temperature variation of the sensor caused by the pumping step [41,42]. The mass increase after the NF3  remote plasma ( Δ MNF3) is due to the fluorination of Al2O3  by F radicals. As shown in Equation 1, Al2O3  is converted to AlF3  by the F radicals, increasing its mass.

$$A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } \left ( s \right ) + 6 F \cdot \left ( g \right ) \rightarrow 2 A l F _ { 3 } ( s ) + 1. 5 O _ { 2 } \left ( g \right )$$

The AlF3  was removed by the TMA pulse, resulting in a mass loss ( Δ MTMA).  As  a  result,  the  Al2O3 film  was  etched  by  an  ALE  cycle, resulting in a mass loss ( Δ MAl2O3).

The modification of the Al2O3 thin film and the removal of the AlF3 layer  were  investigated  by  XPS.  The  Al  2p  peak  in  Fig.  2  (a)  was deconvoluted into three peaks: 74.5  eV, 75.8  eV,  and  76.5  eV  [43], corresponding to the Al-O, AlOxFy, and Al-F bonds, respectively, indicating that AlF3  and AlOxFy  were formed by F radicals. The Al-F peak

was not detected, and the Al-Al peak was reported for ALE using HF [44]. Fig. 2 (b) shows that by the TMA pulse, the peak corresponding to the Al-F bond disappeared, and the intensity of the AlOxFy  peak was significantly reduced. The presence of a small amount of AlOxFy was also observed in the in situ XPS experiments using HF and TMA [32].

The self-limiting behavior of the ALE process was investigated. Fig. 3 shows the MCPC of the Al2O3 thin film at 250  C as a function of the NF3 ◦ remote plasma time or TMA pulse time. The MCPC was saturated at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 69.8 ng/(cm 2 ⋅ cycle) for the NF3  remote plasma over 3 s for a fixed

TMA pulse of 3 s, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Contrary to the report that NF3 molecules fluorinate Al2O3 films [45], NF3 molecules did not contribute to the etching reaction in our experiments (solid circle in Fig. 3(a)). It was also saturated with the TMA pulse over 3 s for a fixed NF3 remote plasma of 4 s, as shown in Fig. 3(b). No etching occurred by supplying only the NF3 remote plasma or TMA. Based on Fig. 3, the duration of the NF3 remote plasma and the TMA pulse were determined to be 4 s and 3 s, respectively. Unlike other ALE processes with quasi-saturation behavior [27,35], the NF3 remote plasma modification step of this work showed fully saturated results. In addition, the MCPC was quickly saturated by a relatively short remote plasma time.

Isotropic etching by ALE was demonstrated using an ALD Al2O3 film deposited over a trench pattern. The depth and bottom width of the trench were 64 nm and 8 nm, respectively, before the etching. Fig. 4 shows the cross-sectional TEM images of the Al2O3 film before and after 30 ALE cycles. The Al2O3  film was thinned in all directions, and the sharp  bottom  corners  were  rounded.  A  similar  phenomenon  was observed in the oxidation process of silicon. According to the experiments  and  modeling  [46,47],  the  oxide  growth  rate  on  the  concave surface is lower than that on the planar surface due to the lower oxidant

concentration at the Si/SiO2 interface. As a result, the Si/SiO2 interface becomes round. Analogous to the oxidation process, the fluorine concentration at the AlF3/Al2O3 interface would be lower than on the planar surface in the ALE Al2O3 process, so the growth rate of the fluorinated layer  would  be  slower  on  the  concave  surface,  resulting  in  a  round bottom. Before etching, the average thicknesses of the film at the top, sidewall, and bottom of the trench were 16.5 nm, 16.1 nm, and 16.7 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(a). After the ALE process, the average thicknesses were reduced to 11.2 nm, 11.4 nm, and 11.8 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(b). As a result, the EPCs at the sidewall and bottom of the trench were 88 % and 92 % of that at the top surface.

products. The EPC increased progressively with temperature from 0.1 Å/ cycle at 198  C to 4.2 Å/cycle at 320  C. Compared to the ALE with HF, ◦ ◦ the ALE with F radicals in this work showed higher EPCs [27], probably due to the higher reactivity of F radicals than HF molecules. On the other hand, the ALE with F radicals showed lower EPCs than the ALE with SF6 ICP [35], probably due to the absence of ion bombardment.

We investigate the effect of substrate temperature on the etching rate of the Al2O3 film in the range of 150 to 320  C, as shown in Fig. 5. The ◦ thickness change after 30 ALE cycles was measured by ellipsometry. The ALE-ALD transition temperature was close to 200  C, similar to the ALE ◦ using HF and TMA [27,31,48]. Since the ALE-ALD transition temperature is determined by the desorption temperature of the etch products, similar transition temperatures for HF and F radicals imply similar etch

The concentration profile of the fluorinated layer was analyzed at different process temperatures to investigate the rate-limiting step, as shown in Fig. 6. The ALE cycle was repeated 5 times, and the samples were analyzed by ToF-SIMS after the fluorination  step  and  after  the removal step. After the fluorination step, the intensity and depth of AlF2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; and AlOF2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; were not significantly different when the temperature was increased  from  200 ◦ C  to  300 ◦ C.  Therefore,  the  fluorinated  layer thickness could not explain the rapid increase in EPC with the change. In contrast,  the  ALE  with  HF  showed  that  the  EPC  increased  with increasing modified layer thickness [44].

On the other hand, a difference in the concentration profile of AlF2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; and AlOF2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; was observed after  the  removal  step.  The  amount  of  the fluorinated  layer  removed  by  TMA,  the  area  between  two  curves  in linear scale (not shown), increased with increasing temperature. The area of the AlF2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; peak decreased by 4.1 % at 200  C, 35 % at 250  C, and ◦ ◦ 57  %  at  300 ◦ C,  respectively.  The  area  of  the  AlOF2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; peak  was  also decreased by 8.0 %, 38 % at 250  C, and 59 % at 300  C, respectively. ◦ ◦ Therefore, the increase in EPC due to the increase in process temperature was due to the increase in the amount of removal. The byproduct of the  reaction  of  AlF3 with  TMA  is  known  as  Al2Fx(CH3)y,  dimer-type molecules with relatively low vapor pressure. For reference, the vapor pressure of an AlF(CH3)2 monomer is 80 Torr at 100  C [49]. Therefore, ◦ high process temperatures are advantageous to enhance the volatility of etching products. It was observed by QCM that the percentage of the fluorinated layer removed by TMA increased with temperature, 19 % at 250  C and 55 % at 300  C [27], which is similar to the result of the ◦ ◦ present work. Therefore, the removal step determined the EPC.

## 4. Conclusions

We studied the thermal ALE of Al2O3 film using NF3 remote plasma and TMA. The mass increased in the modification step by F radicals and decreased in the removal step by TMA. XPS analysis showed that AlF3 and AlOxFy  were formed by F radicals, and all AlF3  and a significant portion of AlOxFy were removed by TMA. At 250  C, the EPC was fully ◦ saturated at 1.58 Å/cycle for the NF3 remote plasma of 4 s and the TMA pulse time of 3 s. Based on the saturation behavior, isotropic etching by ALE was demonstrated for the Al2O3 film prepared on a trench pattern. The EPC increased progressively with temperature from 0.1 Å/cycle at

198  C to 4.2 Å/cycle at 320 ◦ ◦ C. The ALE-ALD transition temperature was close to 200  C. ToF-SIMS analysis showed that the thickness of the ◦ fluorinated layer did not increase significantly with increasing temperature. Therefore, the increase in EPC with temperature was due to the increased volatility of the etch products, and the removal step determined the EPC.
