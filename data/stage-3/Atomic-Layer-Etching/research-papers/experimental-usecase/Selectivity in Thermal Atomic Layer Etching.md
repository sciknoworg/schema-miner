ABSTRACT: Atomic layer etching (ALE) can result from sequential, selflimiting thermal reactions. The reactions during thermal ALE are de /uniFB01 ned by /uniFB02 uorination followed by ligand exchange using metal precursors. The metal precursors introduce various ligands that may transfer during ligand exchange. If the transferred ligands produce stable and volatile metal products, then the metal products may leave the surface and produce etching. In this work, selectivity in thermal ALE was examined by exploring tin(II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2), trimethylaluminum (TMA), dimethylaluminum chloride (DMAC), and SiCl4 as the metal precursors. These metal precursors provide acac, methyl, and chloride ligands for ligand exchange. HF-pyridine was employed as the /uniFB02 uorination reagent. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to

measure the etch rates of Al O , HfO , ZrO , SiO , Si N , and TiN thin 2 3 2 2 2 3 4 /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers. The spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements revealed that HfO2 was etched by all of the metal precursors. Al O 2 3 was etched by all of the metal precursors except SiCl . ZrO 4 2 was etched by all of the metal precursors except TMA. In contrast, SiO , Si N , and TiN were not etched by 2 3 4 any of the metal precursors. These results can be explained by the stability and volatility of the possible reaction products. Temperature can also be used to obtain selective thermal ALE. The temperature dependence of ZrO , HfO , and Al O 2 2 2 3 ALE was examined using SiCl4 as the metal precursor. Higher temperatures can discriminate between the etching of ZrO , HfO , and 2 2 Al2 O3. The temperature dependence of Al2 O3 ALE was also examined using Sn(acac)2, TMA, and DMAC as the metal precursors. Sn(acac)2 etched Al2 O3 at temperatures ≥ 150 ° C. DMAC etched Al2O3 at higher temperatures ≥ 225 ° C. TMA etched Al2 O3 at even higher temperatures ≥ 250 ° C. The combination of di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors with various ligands and di /uniFB00 erent temperatures can provide multiple pathways for selective thermal ALE.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic layer etching (ALE) can remove thin /uniFB01 lms with atomic scale precision using sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. 1,2 Most reported ALE processes have employed halogenation reactions followed by energetic ion or noble gas atom bombardment to etch the material. 1 -4 Thermal ALE processes have also been developed using sequential exposures of HF and metal precursors. 5 Thermal ALE is the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). 6 Thermal ALE studies have demonstrated Al2 O3 ALE, 7,8 HfO2 ALE, 9 and AlF3 ALE. 10 These thermal ALE investigations have utilized HF and Sn(acac)2 as the reactants. Other recent thermal ALE studies have demonstrated Al2O3 ALE using HF and trimethylaluminum (TMA) as the reactants. 11

precursor can accept /uniFB02 uorine from the metal /uniFB02 uoride. The ligand-exchange reaction can also transfer a ligand from the metal precursor to the metal /uniFB02 uoride. The transition state is believed to be a four-center ring formed by the metal in the metal precursor and the metal in the metal /uniFB02 uoride with /uniFB02 uorine and ligand bridging species. 12

The reactions during thermal ALE are based on gas-phase /uniFB02 uorination and ligand exchange as illustrated in Figure 1. 5 Fluorination /uniFB01 rst converts the metal-containing compound to the metal /uniFB02 uoride. Most /uniFB02 uorination reactions of metalcontaining compounds are thermochemically favorable. 5,8 The metal precursor then undergoes a ligand-exchange reaction with the metal /uniFB02 uoride. The ligand exchange can be characterized as a metal exchange transmetalation reaction 12 or a redistribution reaction. 13 During the ligand-exchange reaction, the metal

If the ligand-exchange reaction produces stable and volatile metal products, then the metal products may leave the surface and produce etching. The ligand-exchange reaction may not occur or may not produce etching if the possible metal products are not stable or volatile. This di /uniFB00 erence between the stability and volatility of the possible metal reaction products can lead to selective etching. Selectivity in thermal ALE may also be achievable based on the stability of the resulting metal /uniFB02 uoride or by tuning the etching temperature.

Selectivity in etching is required to remove one material in the presence of other di /uniFB00 erent materials. 1 Selective ALE has many applications in semiconductor device fabrication and surface cleaning. 1 The selectivity in thermal ALE may be much

Ligand-Exchange

Figure 1. Schematic for Al2 O3 ALE using HF and TMA as the reactants. HF /uniFB02 uorinates Al O3 2 to form an AlF3 layer on the surface. Subsequently, TMA accepts F from the AlF3 layer and donates a methyl ligand to the AlF 3 layer to form volatile reaction products such as AlF(CH3)2.

higher than the selectivity during plasma ALE. The selectivity in plasma ALE depends on the energy thresholds for sputtering that are not clearly di /uniFB00 erentiated for most materials. One example of selectivity in plasma ALE is between SiO2 and Si using /uniFB02 uorocarbon adsorption followed by Ar + ion bombardment. 4 Reasonable selectivity is observed for SiO2 etching versus Si etching at an Ar + ion energy of 25 eV. However, selectivity is largely lost at the slightly higher ion energy of 30 eV. 4

In this work, the selectivity in thermal ALE was explored using four di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors for ligand exchange with HF-pyridine as the /uniFB02 uorination precursor. The metal precursors were tin(II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2 ), trimethylaluminum (TMA), dimethylaluminum chloride (DMAC), and silicon tetrachloride (SiCl ). These metal precursors can transfer acac, 4 methyl, and chloride ligands during the ligand-exchange reaction. These reactants were used to etch Al2 O3, HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, Si N , and TiN thin 3 4 /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers. These six materials are all important in semiconductor device processing. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was then employed to measure the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus number of ALE cycles for each of the six materials. These experiments were able to determine the selectivity of thermal ALE to the di /uniFB00 erent materials using the various metal precursors and the relative etch rates.

Additional experiments explored the selectivity of thermal ALE resulting from substrate temperature. The etching of HfO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3 at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures was explored using SiCl 4 as the molecular precursor. Al2 O3 ALE was also examined at various temperatures using Sn(acac) , DMAC, and 2 TMA as the metal precursors. These etching studies revealed that temperature can provide an additional pathway for selective thermal ALE.

## II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

The thermal ALE reactions were performed in a viscous /uniFB02 ow ALD reactor. 14 The reaction temperatures from 150 to 350 ° C were maintained by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) temperature controller (2604, Eurotherm). The pressure was monitored by a capacitance manometer (Baratron 121A, MKS). A constant /uniFB02 ow of 150 sccm of ultra high purity (UHP) N 2 gas was supplied by mass /uniFB02 ow controllers (Type 1179A, MKS). This N2 gas /uniFB02 ow produced a base pressure of ∼ 1 Torr in the reactor pumped by a mechanical pump (Pascal 2015SD, Alcatel).

The /uniFB02 uorination reaction employed a HF-pyridine solution (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich) as the HF source. The HF-pyridine solution has an equilibrium with gaseous HF. The vapor pressure of HF over the HF-pyridine solution is 90 -100 Torr at room temperature. 9 Only gaseous HF, without measurable pyridine vapor, is observed in the gas phase. 15 HF derived from the HF-pyridine solution avoids the di /uniFB03 culty of handling high pressure HF gas cylinders. The HF-pyridine solution was transferred to a gold-plated stainless steel bubbler in a dry N2/uniFB01 lled glovebag. The HF-pyridine solution was held at room temperature. The pressure transients of HF derived from the HFpyridine source were adjusted to ∼ 80 mTorr using a metering bellowssealed valve (SS-4BMG, Swagelok).

The metal precursors for the ligand-exchange reaction were tin(II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2 , 37 -38% Sn, Gelest), trimethylaluminum (TMA) (97%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethylaluminum chloride (DMAC) (97%, Sigma-Aldrich), and silicon tetrachloride (SiCl ) (98%, Gelest). 4 The Sn(acac)2 precursor was maintained at 100 ° C. The Sn(acac)2 pressure transients were adjusted to ∼ 20 mTorr using a metering valve. The TMA, DMAC, and SiCl4 precursors were held at room temperature. The TMA and DMAC pressure transients were regulated at ∼ 40 mTorr using metering valves. The SiCl4 pressure transients were de /uniFB01 ned at ∼ 120 mTorr also using a metering valve. The etch rates reached constant values at longer metal precursor exposures using these pressure transients.

Various thin /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers were prepared by SEMATECH to measure the etch rates during thermal ALE. The TiN, Al O , HfO , 2 3 2 and ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms were deposited by semiconductor ALD processes in commercially available tools. Chemical vapor deposition was employed to prepare the SiO 2 and Si N4 3 /uniFB01 lms using typical process conditions in a high volume single wafer tool. The thickness of all the initial /uniFB01 lms was targeted to be ∼ 50 Å. Actual thicknesses were in the range of 39 -68 Å as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements. The ALE experiments were performed in parallel by placing the Al O , 2 3 HfO2, ZrO2, SiO2, Si3 N4, and TiN thin /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers in the viscous /uniFB02 ow reactor. For each experiment, there was one sample for each of the six materials. The six samples were each 1.25 cm by 1.25 cm in size.

The ALE reactions were performed using an optimized reaction sequence. This reaction sequence is represented as x -30 - -1 30 and consists of an exposure of metal precursor for x s, 30 s of N 2 purge, 1 s of HF exposure derived from the HF-pyridine solution, and 30 s of N 2 purge. The ALE reactions using Sn(acac)2 as a metal precursor were performed using a reaction sequence of 1 -30 - -1 30. The ALE reactions using TMA, DMAC, or SiCl4 as the metal precursor were performed using a reaction sequence of 2 -30 - -1 30. The reaction sequence is optimized when an additional increase in the exposure of the metal precursor does not produce a higher etch rate.

The thicknesses of the various /uniFB01 lms were measured by SE measurements. A spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000, J. A. Woollam) measured Ψ and Δ at 240 -900 nm with an incidence angle of 75 . ° The analysis software (CompleteEASE, J. A. Woollam) /uniFB01 tted Ψ and Δ to determine the thicknesses and refractive index of the /uniFB01 lm. A Sellmeier model was used for /uniFB01 tting the thickness of the Al O , HfO , 2 3 2 ZrO2, SiO2, and Si N4 3 /uniFB01 lms. A Lorentz model was used for /uniFB01 tting the TiN /uniFB01 lm. The /uniFB01 lm thickness versus number of ALE cycles determined the etch rate. Based on least-squares /uniFB01 tting of the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus number of ALE cycles, the reported etch rates are accurate to within ± 0.01 Å/cycle. Most of the individual least-squares /uniFB01 ttings are accurate to within ± 0.005 Å/cycle.

The temperature-dependent ALE experiments on Al2 O3 were performed using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in the viscous /uniFB02 ow ALD reactor. 14 The quartz crystal (gold coated and polished, RC crystal, 6 MHz, Phillip Technologies) was placed in a sensor head (BSH-150, In /uniFB01 con) and then sealed with high temperature epoxy (Epo-Tek H21D, Epoxy technology). The mass changes during the ALE reactions were recorded by a thin /uniFB01 lm deposition monitor (Maxtek TM-400, In /uniFB01 con). 7,8 The initial Al2 O3 /uniFB01 lms were grown on the QCM crystal using Al2O3 ALD with TMA and H2O as the reactants at the same temperature as the ALE reactions.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after 50, 100, 200, and 400 ALE cycles using sequential HF and Sn(acac)2 exposures at 200 ° C. The Al2 O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms were etched linearly versus the number of ALE cycles. In contrast, there were no measurable thickness changes for the SiO , Si N , and TiN 2 3 4 /uniFB01 lms. Figure 2b displays the /uniFB01 lm thickness versus the number of ALE cycles for the Al O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 2 /uniFB01 lms. The slopes from the linear least-squares /uniFB01 ttings of the data in Figure 2b yielded etch rates of 0.23 Å/cycle, 0.14 Å/cycle, and 0.06 Å/cycle for the Al O , 2 3 ZrO2, and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms, respectively. The etch rates of Al O 2 3 and HfO2 are consistent with earlier reported values. 7 -9 The etch rate of ZrO 2 was determined for the /uniFB01 rst time.

Additional control experiments were performed on the Al2 O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms to determine if both HF and Sn(acac)2 were necessary for the thermal ALE. Experiments using 200 cycles of HF exposures observed negligible thickness changes for the Al2 O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms. In addition, sequential exposures of HF and acetylacetone (acacH, SigmaAldrich &gt;99%) did not lead to the etching of Al O 2 3 at 200 ° C.

Without the metal acetylacetonate precursor, acetylacetone alone does not yield thermal ALE.

Both the metal and the ligands on the metal precursor were changed for the results for TMA shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a

displays the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after 25, 50, 100, and 200 ALE cycles using sequential HF and TMA exposures at 300 ° C. The Al2 O3 and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms were etched linearly versus the number of ALE cycles. There were negligible thickness changes during 200 ALE cycles for the ZrO2, SiO , Si N , and TiN 2 3 4 /uniFB01 lms. The /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus the number of ALE cycles for the Al O , 2 3 HfO2, and ZrO2 /uniFB01 lms are shown in Figure 3b. Etch rates of 0.45 Å/cycle and 0.10 Å/cycle were measured for the Al2 O3 and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms, respectively. The etch rate of Al O 2 3 is in agreement with the value measured earlier by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and SE experiments. 11 The etch rate of HfO 2 using HF and TMA was determined for the /uniFB01 rst time. A negligible etch rate of 0.01 Å/cycle was determined for the ZrO 2 /uniFB01 lm.

The metal remained Al and the ligands on the metal precursor were either chlorine or methyl for the results for DMAC that are displayed in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after 10, 25, 50, and 100 ALE cycles using sequential HF and DMAC exposures at 250 ° C. Linear etching was observed for the ZrO2, HfO2, and Al2O3 /uniFB01 lms versus the

number of ALE cycles. No measurable thickness changes were observed for the SiO2, Si N4, 3 and TiN /uniFB01 lms. The /uniFB01 lm thicknesses versus the number of ALE cycles are displayed for the ZrO2 , HfO2, and Al2O3 /uniFB01 lms in Figure 4b. Etch rates of 0.96 Å/cycle, 0.77 Å/cycle, and 0.32 Å/cycle were determined for the ZrO2, HfO2, and Al O3 2 /uniFB01 lms, respectively.

The metal was changed to Si and the ligands on the metal precursor were chlorine for the results for SiCl 4 that are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a displays the /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after 50, 100, 200, and 400 ALE cycles using sequential HF and SiCl 4 exposures at 350 ° C. The ZrO2 and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms were etched linearly versus the number of ALE cycles. In contrast, there were no measurable thickness changes during 400 ALE cycles for the Al O , SiO , Si N , and TiN 2 3 2 3 4 /uniFB01 lms. Figure 5b displays the /uniFB01 lm thickness versus the number of ALE cycles for the ZrO , 2 HfO2, and Al2O3 /uniFB01 lms. Etch rates of 0.14 Å/cycle and 0.05 Å/ cycle were measured for the ZrO 2 and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms, respectively. The etch rate of Al O 2 3 was negligible.

The etching results for SiCl 4 shown in Figure 5 were performed under self-limiting conditions. To con /uniFB01 rm selflimiting behavior, etch rates were measured versus increasing exposure times of SiCl 4 while keeping the HF exposure time constant at 1.0 s. These results are shown in Figure 6a. The etch rates for both ZrO 2 and HfO2 are self-limiting versus SiCl 4

exposure. The etch rates are constant at progressively larger SiCl 4 exposure times. The etch rates at each SiCl 4 exposure time were determined using at least 3 -4 measured /uniFB01 lm thicknesses after di /uniFB00 erent numbers of ALE cycles.

The etch rates were also determined versus increasing exposure times of HF while maintaining a constant SiCl 4 exposure time of 2.0 s. These results are displayed in Figure 6b. The etch rate for HfO 2 is self-limiting versus HF exposures. In addition, the etch rate for ZrO 2 begins to level o /uniFB00 at higher HF exposures. The slight increases at larger HF exposures for ZrO2 can be attributed to the di /uniFB03 culty purging HF from the reactor after longer HF exposures. Residual HF remaining in the reactor will lead to chemical vapor etching (CVE) during the SiCl 4 exposure. Similar in /uniFB02 uences of CVE on thermal ALE have been observed earlier after longer HF exposures. 8,9

Al2 O3 ALE is self-limiting using HF and Sn(acac)2 exposures 8 or HF and TMA exposures. 11 HfO2 ALE is also known to be self-limiting using HF and Sn(acac) exposures. 9 Additional studies have con /uniFB01 rmed that Al2 O3 ALE is selflimiting using HF and DMAC exposures. ZrO2 ALE using HF and Sn(acac)2 exposures, HfO2 or ZrO2 ALE using HF and DMAC exposures and HfO2 ALE using HF and TMA exposures were run under the same self-limiting reaction conditions as employed for Al O3 2 ALE.

The etch rates from the results in Figures 2 -5 are less than the unit cell length or a ' monolayer ' of the various materials. The thermal ALE process removes material progressively based on the /uniFB02 uorination and ligand-exchange reactions. The amount etched in one ALE cycle is determined by how much material is /uniFB02 uorinated and then how much of the metal /uniFB02 uoride is removed by ligand exchange. A similar situation occurs for ALD where the growth per ALD cycle is usually less than the unit cell length or a ' monolayer ' of the material. 16 In the case of ALD, the growth limits are de /uniFB01 ned primarily by the number surface sites that can react with the ALD precursors. 6

B. Discussion of Selectivity Based On Metal Precursor. Figures 2-5 illustrate that the etching depends on both the material and the metal precursor. The etching results can be explained by the stability and volatility of the reaction products. The Al2O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 /uniFB01 lms were etched by most of the metal precursors. The /uniFB02 uorination of Al O , HfO , and ZrO 2 3 2 2 by HF is thermochemically favorable. The reaction Al2 O3 + 6HF(g) → 2AlF3 + 3H2O(g) has Δ G values of -58.4, -53.8, -49.1, and -44.4 kcal/mol at 200, 250, 300, and 350 ° C, respectively. 17 The reaction HfO2 + 4HF(g) → HfF4 + 2H2O(g) has Δ G values of -19.1, -16.0, -12.8, and -9.6 kcal/mol at 200, 250, 300, and 350 ° C, respectively. 17 The reaction ZrO2 + 4HF(g) → ZrF4 + 2H2O(g) has Δ G values of -18.4, -15.2, -12.1, and -8.9 kcal/mol at 200, 250, 300, and 350 ° C, respectively. 17 The resulting AlF3, HfF4, and ZrF4 reaction products are not volatile. AlF , HfF , and ZrF 3 4 4 sublime at 1276, 970, and 912 ° C, respectively. 18

The subsequent ligand-exchange reactions can produce stable and volatile reaction products for most of the metal precursors with the AlF , HfF , and ZrF 3 4 4 metal /uniFB02 uorides. For example, for the Sn(acac) 2 results shown in Figure 2, Sn(acac) 2 can accept F and donate acac to produce volatile SnF(acac) and metal products with acac ligands. This ligand exchange is facilitated by the ability of /uniFB02 uorine to form bimetallic bridges. 19 The acac ligand from Sn(acac)2 can form stable metal acetylacetonate compounds with Al, Hf, and Zr. Al(acac) 3 has a vapor pressure of ∼ 3 Torr at 150 ° C. 20 Hf(acac)4 and Zr(acac)4 have vapor pressures &gt; ∼ 0.1 Torr at 150 ° C. 21 The exact metal products have not yet been identi /uniFB01 ed with mass spectrometry. Metal /uniFB02 uoro(acetylacetonate) etch products are also possible. Related chloro(acetylacetonate) compounds have been characterized such as SnCl(acac) and AlCl2 (acac). 22,23 Additional halo(acetylacetonate) compounds have also been reported such as HfX(acac)3, HfX2(acac)2, ZrX(acac)3, and ZrX2(acac)2 where X = Cl or Br. 24,25

For the TMA results displayed in Figure 3, TMA can etch Al2 O3 and HfO2. In contrast, TMA can not etch ZrO2. The methyl ligand from TMA can form stable metal methyl compounds with Al and Hf. TMA can accept F from AlF3 and donate CH3 producing volatile AlF(CH3)2 from TMA and metal products with methyl ligands from AlF3. The possible four-center transition state for the ligand-exchange reaction between TMA and AlF3 is shown in Figure 7a. The vapor

pressure of AlF(CH3)2 is 80 Torr at 100 ° C. 26 AlF(CH3)2 has been characterized as a tetramer in the gas phase. 27 AlF(CH3)2 may also be the favored metal reaction product derived from AlF3. TMA can also accept F from HfF4 and donate CH3 to HfF4 to produce volatile AlF(CH3 2 ) and Hf reaction products with methyl ligands. Tetramethylhafnium Hf(CH3)4 has been prepared but is known to be unstable at &gt; -30 ° C. 28 The presence of F together with the CH3 ligand may stabilize the HfF (CH3)4 x -x etch products.

In contrast, Figure 3 illustrates that TMA does not etch the ZrO2 /uniFB01 lm. This result is somewhat surprising because Zr and Hf generally share many chemical properties due to their similar atomic and ionic radii. However, the stability of

Hf(CH3)4 is known to be larger than Zr(CH3)4. 29 The Hf -CH3 0 bond energy is also larger than the Zr -CH3 bond energy. 3 Zr(CH3)4 has been prepared but decomposes even at low temperatures ≤ 15 ° C. 31 The lack of etching of ZrO2 by sequential HF and TMA exposures may result from no methyl ligand transfer from TMA to ZrF4 in the possible four-center transition state displayed in Figure 7b.

Although TMA did not etch ZrO2, DMAC was able to etch ZrO2 e /uniFB00 ectively as shown in Figure 4. The di /uniFB00 erence between TMA and DMAC is the chloride ligand on DMAC. The chloride ligand may form Al -Cl -Zr bridge species that facilitate etching. 32 These Al -Cl -Zr bridge species are illustrated in the proposed four-center transition state for ligand exchange between DMAC and ZrF4 in Figure 7c. The chloride ligand may also promote the stability or volatility of the Zr reaction products. DMAC is known to be a good /uniFB02 uoride acceptor and chloride donor when reacting with Hf and Zr /uniFB02 uorides. 33 Hf and Zr form stable volatile metal chlorides. HfCl4 and ZrCl4 sublime at 317 and 331 ° C, respectively. 18 The presence of Cl in the metal precursor may also stabilize the etch products. ZrCl (CH ) 2 3 2 and ZrCl3(CH3) are much more stable than Zr(CH3)4. 34

Figure 5 shows that SiCl 4 is also able to etch ZrO . Together 2 with the results for DMAC, these results argue that the chloride ligand is responsible for forming stable and volatile Zr reaction products. The possible four-center transition state for ligand exchange between SiCl4 and ZrF4 is displayed in Figure 7d. This ligand exchange would again form stable and volatile Zr chlorides.

The most surprising result in Figure 5 is the lack of Al O 2 3 etching by SiCl . 4 ZrO2 and HfO2 were both etched by sequential SiCl 4 and HF exposures. Zr and Hf are both known to form volatile metal chlorides. Al can also form volatile metal chlorides such as AlCl 3. The lack of Al O3 2 etching by SiCl 4 led to the exploration of alternative explanations involving the reaction thermochemistry. The thermochemistry of the ligand exchange was determined assuming complete ligand exchange to form SiF4 and the fully chlorinated metal in the original metal /uniFB02 uoride.

The thermochemical results for the ligand exchange between SiCl 4 and AlF3, ZrF4 and HfF4 are given in Figure 8. These results reveal that the ligand exchange between SiCl 4 and ZrF4 or HfF4 is thermochemically favorable at &gt;200 ° C. In contrast, the ligand exchange between SiCl 4 and AlF3 is not thermchemically favorable at any temperature shown in Figure 8. These results are consistent with the results in Figure 5. ZrF 4 and HfF4 can both undergo ligand exchange with SiCl 4 at 350 ° C because these reactions are spontaneous with Δ G ≈ -10 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Al O 2 3 can not be etched at 350 ° C because the ligand exchange between SiCl4 and AlF3 is not spontaneous with Δ G ≈ + 26 kcal/mol.

In contrast to the results for Al O , HfO 2 3 2 and ZrO2, SiO2 and Si N4 3 were not etched by any of the metal precursors under the reported reaction conditions. The formation of SiF 4 from SiO2 and Si N4 3 by reaction with HF is thermochemically favorable. The reaction SiO2 + 4HF(g) → SiF4 (g) + 2H2O(g) has Δ G values of -14.0, -13.0, and -12.0 kcal/mol at 200, 250, and 300 ° C, respectively. 17 The reaction Si N4 3 + 12HF(g) → 3SiF4 (g) + 4NH3(g) has Δ G values of -159.9, -153.2, and -146.5 kcal/mol at 200, 250, and 300 ° C, respectively. 17 Both of these reactions produce SiF4 as a reaction product. SiF 4 is extremely volatile. However, neither SiO2 nor Si N4 3 is etched spontaneously by HF. The /uniFB02 uorination of SiO 2 or Si N4 3 does

not proceed all the way to SiF . In agreement with these results, 4 HF does not etch SiO2 in the absence of H O. 2 35,36

Another explanation for the lack of etching of SiO 2 and Si N4 3 is that the ligand-exchange reactions for Si -F species are not favorable. The Si -F bond is a very strong. The Si -F bond in F3Si -F has a bond strength of 167 kcal/mol. 37 The activation energy for breaking the Si -F bond may be too high for an e /uniFB00 ective ligand-exchange reaction. Large Si -F bond strengths also lead to large activation energies for the hydrolysis of SiF . 4 38

Ligand exchange may also not occur for the Si-compounds because the resulting reaction products are unstable. Si(IV) favors coordination numbers of four or six. The production of Si(acac) 4 when using Sn(acac)2 as the metal precursor is not possible because this complex requires eight coordination. The requirements for Si acetylacetonates lead to a monodentating acac ligand or a cationic product such as Si(acac) 3 + 39 . In contrast, Si could form stable Si(CH ) 3 4 when using TMA as the metal precursor. Si could also form Si(CH3)4 or SiCl 4 when using DMAC as the metal precursor. Consequently, the lack of etching of SiO2 and Si3 N4 is probably explained by the high activation barrier to break Si -F bonds during ligand exchange.

TiN was also not etched by any of the metal precursors. The formation of TiF3 from TiN by HF is thermochemically favorable. The reaction TiN + 3HF(g) → TiF3 + NH3(g) has Δ G values of -40.3, -37.0, and -33.8 kcal/mol at 200, 250, and 300 ° C. 17 The ligand-exchange reaction between TiF 3 and Sn(acac)2 may also be possible. The production of Ti(acac)3 from TiN when using Sn(acac)2 should be feasible based on earlier studies that have prepared Ti(acac) . 3 40 In contrast, the production of Ti(CH3)3 from TiF3 when using TMA as the metal precursor is not expected because there are no previous reports for Ti(CH ) 3 3 in the literature. Likewise, the production of TiCl3 from TiF3 when using DMAC or SiCl4 as the metal precursor may not be viable because TiCl3 has low volatility with a boiling point of 960 ° C. 18

In addition to the absence of stable or volatile Ti(III) reaction products, the lack of etching of TiN may be explained by a TiN O x y or TiO2 layer on the TiN surface. 41,42 In this case, HF would be required to /uniFB02 uorinate a Ti(IV) surface species.

This reaction is nearly thermochemically neutral. 17 The formation of Ti(acac) 4 when using Sn(acac)2 as the metal precursor for ligand exchange is also not favorable. Producing Ti(acac) 4 is not possible because this reaction product requires eight coordination. Ti(IV) acetylacetonate compounds favor six coordination with complexes such as Ti(  O) (acac)2 and TiCl2(acac) . 2

The production of Ti(CH3)4 from TiF4 when using TMA as the metal precursor is also not expected because Ti(CH3)4 decomposes at low temperatures ≤ 78 ° C. 34 In contrast, the production of TiCl 4 or TiCl F y 4 -y from TiF4 when using DMAC or SiCl 4 as the metal precursor is possible because TiCl 4 is a stable and volatile molecule. On the basis of these chemical arguments, the negligible etching of TiN by Sn(acac) , TMA, 2 DMAC, or SiCl4 is attributed to either the absence of stable or volatile Ti(III) reaction products or the di /uniFB03 culty of /uniFB02 uorinating Ti(IV) surface species using HF.

- C. Selectivity Based On Temperature. Temperature is also an important variable for selective thermal ALE. The temperature-dependent etch rates of ZrO2, HfO2, and Al2O3 using sequential HF and SiCl 4 exposures are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Etch rates of ZrO2, HfO2, and Al2O3 versus temperature using SiCl 4 as the metal precursor.

None of the three metal oxides is etched at 250 ° C. The etch rates for ZrO2 and HfO2 become measurable at 300 ° C. The etch rates at 350 ° C were obtained from Figure 5. The etch rate of ZrO2 is larger than HfO2 at both 300 and 350 ° C. The etch rate of Al2 O3 is not measurable at any of the three temperatures.

The results in Figure 9 are consistent with the thermochemical calculations in Figure 8. The ligand-exchange reaction between SiCl 4 and AlF3 is unfavorable at all the temperatures shown in Figure 8. The ligand-exchange reaction between SiCl4 and ZrF4 or HfF4 is feasible at &gt;200 ° C. The increasing negative Δ G for the ligand-exchange reaction between SiCl4 and ZrF4 or HfF4 in Figure 8 is in agreement with the increasing etch rates at &gt;250 ° C displayed in Figure 9. The ZrO2 etch rate is higher than the HfO2 etch rate even though their predicted Δ G values are nearly equivalent. There must be additional kinetic factors that determine the actual etch rates.

Temperature and various metal precursors can also be used to tune the etch rate of a particular material. For example, the etch rates for Al2 O3 ALE using various metal precursors are compared at di /uniFB00 erent reaction temperatures in Figure 10. The ALE results for Sn(acac) 2 as the metal precursor were obtained

Figure 10. Etch rates of Al2 O3 at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures using (a) Sn(acac)2, (b) DMAC and (c) TMA as the metal precursor.

earlier using a reaction sequence of 1 -30 - -1 30. 8 The ALE results for TMA as the metal precursor were also measured earlier using a reaction sequence of 2 -30 - -1 30. 11 The ALE results for DMAC as the metal precursor were obtained using a reaction sequence of 2 -30 - -1 30. Each etch rate was measured using the mass change per cycle (MCPC) and the density of the Al O 2 3 /uniFB01 lm obtained by XRR.

The Al2O3 etching has di /uniFB00 erent threshold temperatures for each metal precursor. The Al O 2 3 etch rates all increase at higher temperatures after exceeding the threshold temperature. Figure 10a shows that Sn(acac)2 etched Al O3 2 at temperatures ≥ 150 ° C. In comparison, Figure 10b indicates that DMAC etched Al2 O3 at higher temperatures ≥ 225 ° C. Figure 10c shows that TMA etched Al2O3 at even higher temperatures ≥ 250 ° C. The di /uniFB00 erent temperature thresholds may be attributed to varying activation barriers for the ligand-exchange reactions. The di /uniFB00 erent temperature thresholds for the etching may provide another method for obtaining selective thermal ALE.

## IV. CONCLUSIONS

Selective thermal ALE can be accomplished by using di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors for ligand exchange. This study explored selectivity in ALE using Sn(acac) , TMA, DMAC, and SiCl4 2 as the metal precursors. These di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors transfer acac, methyl, and chloride ligands during ligand exchange. Etching can occur if these ligands form stable and volatile reaction products during the ligand-exchange reaction. Di /uniFB00 erences between the stability and volatility of the possible reaction products can lead to selective etching.

This study examined the etching of Al O , HfO , ZrO , SiO , 2 3 2 2 2 Si N4, 3 and TiN thin /uniFB01 lms on silicon wafers. All of the metal precursors etched HfO2 . All of the metal precursors also etched Al2 O3 except SiCl . 4 ZrO2 was etched by all of the metal precursors except TMA. In contrast, none of the metal precursors could etch SiO2, Si N4 3 , and TiN. The explanation for these results was based on the stability and volatility of the possible reaction products. The lack of etching of Al2 O3 by SiCl 4 was explained based on thermochemical considerations.

Selective thermal ALE can also be achieved by tuning the reaction temperature. The etching of ZrO2, HfO2, and Al2O3

using SiCl 4 as the metal precursor was consistent with thermochemical calculations. Temperature can be used to adjust the ZrO2 etch rate relative to the HfO 2 etch rate using SiCl 4 as the metal precursor. The combination of di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors and variable temperature can also tune the etch rate for Al O 2 3 ALE over a wide range of temperature.

The combination of di /uniFB00 erent metal precursors with various ligands and di /uniFB00 erent temperatures will provide pathways for selective thermal ALE. The selectivity in thermal ALE will complement the selectivity in ALD to provide for maskless processing. This selectivity will be important for atomic level processing to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.
