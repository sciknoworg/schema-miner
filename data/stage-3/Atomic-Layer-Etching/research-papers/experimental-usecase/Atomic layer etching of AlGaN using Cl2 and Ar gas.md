The atomic layer etching (ALE) characteristics of AlGaN using Cl2 plasma in the modi /uniFB01 cation step and Ar plasma in the removal step were investigated in comparison with conventional reactive ion etching (RIE). Although surface roughening and GaN composition changes were observed in the RIE process, the ALE process did not result in such changes. However, the etching damage of the AlGaN layer evaluated using cathodoluminescence in AlGaN/GaN stacked /uniFB01 lms in the case of ALE was 30% higher than that in RIE. This was attributed to the longer process time of ALE compared to RIE. The GaN layer underneath the AlGaN layer was also damaged. This could be mainly caused by UV photons during the modi /uniFB01 cation step using Cl2 plasma. The authors introduced a modi /uniFB01 cation step using Cl2 gas instead of Cl2 plasma; thus, the etching damage was successfully reduced while maintaining good surface characteristics.

## I. INTRODUCTION

For next-generation power devices, wide-bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and GaN are being developed. The GaN-based high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is a promising candidate for ultralow-loss power switching devices owing to its high breakdown voltage and high electron carrier velocity in the transistor channel giving a low on-state resistance. While power switching applications strongly demand normally-off operation from the fail-safe point of view, this normally-off operation for a GaN/AlGaN HEMT is still a challenge. Several normally-off structures have been investigated such as recess gate, 1 -5 /uniFB02 uorine ion treatment, 6 8 -and p-GaN gate structures. 9 12 -In general, the recess gate is considered a simple structure and can be fabricated without complicated process steps in comparison with other structures. The recess gate HEMT has the AlGaN layer partially removed using dry etching, resulting in an in-plane AlGaN/GaN heterojunction. In this structure, a gate insulator can be used to suppress the gate leakage current and increase the on-state operation swing. However, the recess gate poses three main challenges in the etching process, such as control of the residual AlGaN /uniFB01 lm thickness, surface roughness, and plasma-induced damage. First, the residual AlGaN thickness directly affects the initial gate threshold voltage (Vth); therefore, very precise control of this thickness is required. 4,5 In addition, from a manufacturing point of view, controllability, uniformity, and repeatability of the etch depth across a large wafer are major challenges. Second, a rough surface would increase the interface state density and reduce electron

mobility. 13,14 Third, plasma induces surface damages, such as lattice defects, discharge-gas-related residues, and nonstoichiometric surfaces, 15 -25 which degrade the electrical characteristics of the device. 15 -18 Recently, it was reported that some etching damages could be reversed via an additional thermal annealing process after etching. 15,16,19,23,25 The higher the temperature in the annealing process, the higher the extent to which the damages could be reversed; however, it was dif /uniFB01 cult to reverse the etching damages completely. Therefore, one of the promising methods to solve these three problems in AlGaN etching could be atomic layer etching (ALE).

ALE is mainly composed of four steps: surface modi /uniFB01 cation such as adsorption of etch species, oxidation, and nitridation, purging, removal of the modi /uniFB01 ed layer, and purging again. 26 Both the modi /uniFB01 cation and removal steps are selflimiting, and therefore, ALE has the advantage of good controllability of the etch depth, compared to conventional reactive ion etching (RIE). In previous studies on ALE of GaN or AlGaN, the surface was oxidized with O2 plasma, and subsequently, this oxidized layer was removed with BCl3 plasma. 27 This oxidation step was a self-limiting process, but BCl3 plasma etching in the removal step was not selflimiting. Recently, a directional type of ALE for GaN and AlGaN /uniFB01 lms using Cl2 or BCl3/Cl2 plasma and Ar ion bombardment was investigated. 28 In this process, both the modi/uniFB01 cation and removal steps are self-limiting. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the GaN /uniFB01 lm etched via ALE using Cl2 and Ar plasma was 0.6 nm while that obtained via RIE was 4.0 nm; the surface of the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm etched via ALE using BCl3/Cl2 and Ar plasma was also very smooth, and its RMS surface roughness was 0.3 nm. The etching damages caused in the GaN /uniFB01 lm using RIE were evaluated via photoluminescence analysis. 19,20,29 -32 However, etching damage caused by ALE is not reported so far.

Therefore, in this study, we precisely investigated the ALE process of AlGaN/GaN stacked /uniFB01 lms using Cl2/Ar gas chemistry and the possible etching damage caused by ALE.

## II. EXPERIMENT

## A. Experimental setup

The AlGaN/GaN heterostructure was epitaxially grown on a Si substrate via metal organic chemical vapor deposition. A 30-nm AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was stacked on a 100-nm GaN /uniFB01 lm. Conventional RIE and ALE processes were performed in a standard transformer coupled plasma (TCP) etching system, operating at a 13.56 MHz RF power, and a separate 13.56 MHz RF power was also supplied to the bottom electrode. The sample stage temperature was 25 °C, and the chamber pressure was kept at 20 mTorr. First, the native oxide layer on the AlGaN surface was removed via RIE using the BCl3/Cl2 chemistry at a self-bias voltage of 131 V and a TCP power of 700 W. This etching process was termed the break through (BT) step, and the etch depth of AlGaN at this step was approximately 5 nm. Next, the AlGaN surface was etched using RIE or ALE. In the case of RIE, AlGaN was etched using the Cl2/Ar chemistry, with a self-bias voltage of 45 V and a TCP power of 700 W. Cl2 plasma and Ar plasma were used for the modi /uniFB01 cation step and the removal step, respectively. The AlGaN surface was exposed to Cl2 plasma at a pressure of 20 mTorr for 30 s at a TCP power of 700 W, in which the self-bias voltage was set at 0 V to prevent the etching of the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm. After 30 s of Cl2 plasma exposure, the surface was irradiated by Ar plasma at a pressure of 20 mTorr and a TCP power of 700 W where the self-bias voltage was changed from 0 to 100 V, and exposure time to Ar plasma was changed from 0 to 100 s. Between the modi /uniFB01 cation and removal steps, a purge step without plasma was carried out to avoid contamination by residual gas and radicals. The purge time after the modi /uniFB01 cation and removal steps was 30 s at a pressure of 20 mTorr with Ar gas /uniFB02 ow. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was carried out to estimate the reactive species in the plasmas.

## B. Film characterization

The thickness of the unetched and etched AlGaN /uniFB01 lms was measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry (Woollam M-2000). The surface roughness was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Hitachi High-Tech Science E-sweep). The measurements were performed in tapping mode under ambient conditions, and the scanning area was 1 × 1 μ m 2 . The initial surface roughness of AlGaN was 0.09 nm. The atomic composition and chemical bonding of the etched surfaces were analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000). To evaluate the plasma-induced damage, the etched AlGaN/GaN surface was analyzed via cathodoluminescence (CL). For CL measurements, a JEOL JSM-7100F/TTLS scanning electron microscopy (SEM) system was used as the excitation source, and the emitted light was analyzed via a HORIBA Jobin Yvon iHR-320. The acceleration voltage of the electron beam for SEM was 2 kV, and the electron penetration depth in AlGaN was approximately 45 nm. Under this condition, we could evaluate not only the etched AlGaN /uniFB01 lm but also the underlying GaN /uniFB01 lm.

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## A. Basic etching characteristic of ALE

First, we evaluated the modi /uniFB01 cation step performed using Cl2 plasma. After the BT step, the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was exposed to Cl2 plasma. According to XPS analysis results, the Cl/Ga atomic composition ratio increased with an increase in the Cl2 plasma exposure time and then became saturated. The AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was not etched by the Cl2 plasma regardless of the exposure time. Based on this result, we chose 30 s as the Cl2 plasma exposure for the modi /uniFB01 cation step. Figure 1 shows the AlGaN etch depth per cycle (EPC) depending on the self-bias voltage of Ar plasma for the removal step. This EPC was determined using the average etch depth for /uniFB01 ve cycles. The AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was not etched at self-bias voltages below 25 V, but started to be etched above 30 V, corresponding to regime (i). A constant EPC of ∼ 0.5 nm was obtained at the bias condition from 35 to 50 V. This corresponded to regime (ii), and this removal step was selflimiting in this regime. 26 EPC increased signi /uniFB01 cantly above 60 V owing to the sputtering effect, which corresponded to regime (iii). 26 We chose a self-bias voltage of 45 V for our ALE process. Figure 2 shows the dependence of EPC on the Ar plasma exposure time. EPC increased with an increase in the Ar plasma exposure time for the /uniFB01 rst 30 s and then became saturated after 30 s. We chose an Ar exposure time of 30 s for our ALE process. In this process, both the modi /uniFB01 -cation and removal steps were self-limiting, and a good linearity between the etch depth and the number of cycles was obtained. Thus, it was con /uniFB01 rmed that the process had good controllability in terms of the etch depth.

/uniFB01 lm, which was etched using conventional RIE and ALE. The self-bias voltage in RIE was 45 V, and this was the same as that of ALE for the removal step using Ar ion bombardment. Both the modi /uniFB01 cation step using Cl2 plasma and the removal step using Ar plasma were performed for 30 s. The roughness of AlGaN after the BT step slightly increased to 0.13 nm from 0.09 nm of the initial unetched surface. Both the etch depth and surface roughness variation, respectively, shown on the x -axis and y -axes of Fig. 3 were measured from the end of the BT step. In the case of RIE, the roughness increased with an increase in the etch depth. On the other hand, the surface roughness in ALE did not change regardless of the etch depth. According to the XPS analysis results, the N/Ga composition ratio on the AlGaN surface etched using ALE was the same as that after the BT step. The N/Ga ratio in the case of RIE decreased after etching. This nitrogen desorption from the surface etched using RIE is supposed to induce surface roughness. 19,22,29 Because the vapor pressures of the etching by-products such as NClx or

N2 are higher than that of GaClx, 33 nitrogen trends to desorb preferentially. In the case of ALE, after the uniform modi /uniFB01 ed layer was formed during the modi /uniFB01 cation step, this layer was completely removed during the removal step. Thus, a smooth surface was obtained via ALE.

In the case of ALE, the etch depth in the Ar removal step was very less and independent of the Ar plasma exposure time, which could have suppressed roughening of the surface. This result shows that the ALE process could produce an AlGaN /uniFB01 lm with a smooth and stoichiometric surface.

## C. Etching damage evaluation using CL

To evaluate crystal defects induced by etching, CL measurements were performed. The etching damage in GaN /uniFB01 lms introduced by conventional RIE was analyzed via CL. 34 36 -After the BT step, 2.5 nm of the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was etched using ALE or RIE, and the residual thicknesses etched using ALE and RIE were 22.6 and 23.0 nm, respectively. The penetration depth of the electrons was approximately 45 nm for our CL measurements; hence, we could evaluate not only the etched AlGaN /uniFB01 lm but also the underlying GaN /uniFB01 lm. Figure 4(a) shows CL spectra related to the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm. The near-band-edge (NBE) signal of AlGaN was observed at approximately 325 nm (3.8 eV). The degradation of the NBE signal intensity means that some crystal defects are introduced into the /uniFB01 lm owing to etching damage. The intensity of the AlGaN NBE signal drastically decreased

after etching, indicating that severe damages were introduced by both the RIE and ALE processes. Furthermore, it was found that the etching damage caused by ALE was higher than that caused by RIE; the AlGaN NBE intensity decreased by 64% after RIE, while its intensity decreased by 86% after ALE. Figure 4(b) shows the CL spectra for the GaN /uniFB01 lm. The NBE signal of GaN was observed at approximately 364 nm (3.4 eV). The GaN /uniFB01 lm underneath the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was not etched at all in both ALE and RIE, but the GaN NBE signal intensity decreased after etching. The GaN /uniFB01 lm underneath the etched AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was also defective, and the defects caused by ALE were also larger than those caused by RIE. A 6% decrease in the GaN NBE intensity was observed after RIE, while a 17% decrease was observed after ALE. We compared the etching process time between RIE and ALE. The etching time in RIE was 20 s. On the other hand, in the case of ALE, the duration of the Cl2 plasma modi /uniFB01 cation step was 30 s and that of the Ar plasma removal step was 30 s; thus, the total plasma exposure time in /uniFB01 ve ALE cycles for etching 2.5 nm was 300 s. The plasma exposure time in ALE was 15 times longer than that in RIE. We speculate that the longer process time in ALE would induce more plasma damage. Next, we discuss the root cause of etching damage.

## D. Root cause of etching damage

In general, plasma-induced damages were mainly introduced by radicals, ions, and photons. Radicals do not have much energy, and the radical penetration depth is limited to only the surface. The penetration depth of Ar ions was estimated to be approximately 0.5 nm for a self-bias voltage of 45 V, determined using the SRIM/TRIM software package. 37 Next, the photon penetration depths of the AlGaN and GaN /uniFB01 lms were evaluated. While Ar plasma does not have strong emission peaks in the UV region (200 -320 nm), Cl2 plasma has several strong emission peaks. 38 Figure 5 shows the optical emissions of the Cl2 plasma in the modi /uniFB01 cation step. We also observed strong emissions at approximately 257 nm (4.8 eV) and 308 nm (4.0 eV), related to Cl2 molecules in the UV region. The penetration depths into the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm at 308 and 257 nm are 104 and 63 nm, respectively. Both these penetration depths were larger than 23 nm, the thickness of

FIG. 5. Optical emission from Cl2 plasma in the adsorption step with a TCP power of 700 W, a self-bias voltage of 0 V, and a pressure of 20 mTorr.

<!-- image -->

the residual AlGaN /uniFB01 lm; this indicates that photons at these wavelengths could cause defects in the entire AlGaN /uniFB01 lm. The penetration depths into the GaN /uniFB01 lm at 308 and 257 nm were 97 and 66 nm, respectively. According to this estimation, the photons at these wavelengths could penetrate into not only the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm but also the GaN /uniFB01 lm, damaging both the GaN /uniFB01 lm and the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm. Therefore, the damage induced in the unetched GaN /uniFB01 lm was attributed not to ions and radicals but to UV photons.

To separately analyze the etching damage induced by UV photons and that induced by ions and radicals, the AlGaN/ GaN stacked /uniFB01 lm was etched with and without a quartz window (QW) (0.5-mm thick) on the sample for /uniFB01 ve cycles after the BT step, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Figures 6(b) and 6(c) show the CL results of AlGaN and GaN /uniFB01 lms, respectively. According to Fig. 6(b), in the case without the QW, the AlGaN NBE signal intensity drastically decreased, as shown in Fig. 4(a); this degradation was caused by ions, radicals, and photons. On the other hand, the degradation of the AlGaN

FIG. 6. NBE signal intensities of etched AlGaN/GaN with and without quartz windows: (a) sample setup, (b) NBE signal intensity of AlGaN, and (c) NBE signal intensity of GaN.

<!-- image -->

NBE signal intensity in the presence of the QW was much lower than that in the absence of the QW, which was induced by only UV photons. The damage to the AlGaN /uniFB01 lm induced by ions and radicals was larger than that induced by photons. The decrease in GaN NBE signal intensity in the cases with and without the QW shown in Fig. 6(c) was caused by only photons because ions and radicals could not reach the GaN layer. These results clearly indicated that photons could damage both the AlGaN and GaN layers. The amount of degradation during etching without the QW was slightly larger than that with the QW in Fig. 6(c). This is because a slightly etched (approximately 7 nm) AlGaN layer resulted in increased photon penetration.

As mentioned earlier, Ar does not have inherently strong emissions between 200 and 320 nm; this indicates that the damage on the AlGaN and GaN /uniFB01 lms might be caused by only Cl2 plasma exposure. To compare the UV photon damage between Cl2 and Ar plasmas, the following experiment was carried out. After the BT step, we exposed the AlGaN/GaN stacked layer to either only Cl2 plasma or only Ar plasma, with the same conditions as those employed in the modi /uniFB01 cation or removal steps, respectively. The AlGaN /uniFB01 lm was not etched by the Ar plasma without Cl2 plasma exposure. Figure 7 shows a normalized GaN NBE signal intensity as a function of the plasma exposure time. The NBE signal intensity after Cl2 or Ar plasma exposure was normalized using that obtained after the BT step. The GaN NBE signal intensity after exposure to Cl2 or Ar plasma decreased with an increase in the plasma exposure time. Photon damage on the GaN caused by Cl2 plasma was larger than that caused by Ar plasma. It was observed that even Ar plasma induced photon damage, although there are inherently no strong emission peaks between 200 and 320 nm. We will discuss the reason for this phenomenon later. After 360 s of plasma exposure, the amount of deterioration caused by Cl2 plasma was the same as that caused by Ar plasma. Under our CL measurement conditions, only the

19-nm top layer of the GaN /uniFB01 lm was analyzed. This top layer was completely damaged by UV radiation during the long plasma exposure time; therefore, there is no large difference in the NBE signal intensities between the Cl2 and Ar plasmas.

We examined the reason why the Ar plasma induced damage on the GaN /uniFB01 lm. Figure 8(a) shows an emission intensity of 308 nm, corresponding to Cl2 molecules as a function of the process time for both the Cl2 plasma modi /uniFB01 cation step and the Ar plasma removal step. A strong emission intensity was observed in the Cl2 plasma step, and this intensity was relatively stable. Moreover, the 308-nm emission line was also observed during the Ar plasma step, and this intensity was smaller than that in the Cl2 plasma step. UV emissions related to Cl 2 during the Ar plasma step might be attributed to the chlorine residue on the chamber wall, and these UV emissions could induce photon damage on the GaN and AlGaN /uniFB01 lms even in the Ar plasma step. We analyzed the etched AlGaN /uniFB01 lm using XPS. Just after the modi /uniFB01 cation step using Cl2 plasma, a Cl 2p peak with a binding energy of approximately 198 eV was observed (not shown). This intensity decreased with the Ar plasma exposure time of the removal step, but a Cl2-related peak was still observed even after 30 s of exposure in the Ar plasma step. This suggests that Cl adsorbed on the chamber wall was not removed completely during the removal step; therefore, this residual Cl would appear again.

## E. Photon damage reduction

It was found that UV-induced damage was serious in ALE owing to its long process time. The primary reason for degradation was UV emission from Cl2 plasma. To reduce UV photon damage, we propose a remote Cl2 plasma or Cl2 gas process in the modi /uniFB01 cation step because it is possible to remove UV photons during the modi /uniFB01 cation step. Ar plasma potentially causes less UV damage. However, the residual Cl on the chamber wall is desorbed into the Ar plasma, and it would produce UV photons in the removal step as long as

FIG. 8. Emission intensity at 308 nm as a function of process time: (a) ALE using Cl2 plasma and (b) ALE using Cl2 gas.

<!-- image -->

we use the same chamber for the modi /uniFB01 cation and removal steps. Therefore, it could be possible to suppress UV damage during the removal step using the following two methods. The /uniFB01 rst one is the use of the same Ar plasma, but this process should be carried out in a separate chamber and not the one used in the modi /uniFB01 cation step with Cl2 plasma. The second one is using a neutral Ar beam, which has very limited plasma radiation. 39,40 Hemmi et al. reported that the current collapse caused by the interface traps at the gate electrode is suppressed by neutral-beam etching of the stacked AlGaN/GaN structure. 41 However, additional chambers or equipment would increase the process time and cost.

Therefore, we examined Cl2 gas exposure instead of using Cl2 plasma for the modi /uniFB01 cation step and Ar plasma for the removal step in the same chamber. The EPC of the Cl2 gas process at a pressure of 200 mTorr was 0.34 nm. Figure 3(d) shows the dependence of the surface roughness variation on the etched depth in the Cl2 gas process. Regardless of the etched depth, the surface roughness produced in ALE using Cl2 gas did not increase, as with Cl2 plasma. We compared the photon damage on the GaN /uniFB01 lm caused in ALE using Cl2 gas, ALE using Cl2 plasma, and RIE using Cl2/Ar plasma. The total etched depth of AlGaN was 7 nm, including the BT step. First, OES of Cl2 plasma was performed. No emission, even at 308 nm, was observed during the modi/uniFB01 cation step in the case of ALE using Cl2 gas, as shown in Fig. 8(b). However, the 308-nm emission in the Cl2 gas process still appeared just after ignition of the Ar plasma. The emission intensity was not signi /uniFB01 cantly suppressed in the Ar plasma step even when Cl2 gas was used for ALE. When we performed ALE with Cl2 gas using the same chamber for the modi /uniFB01 cation and removal steps, it was dif /uniFB01 -cult to suppress Cl-related emissions in the Ar plasma step. The 308-nm photon /uniFB02 ux at the same etch depth was estimated from OES. The total photon /uniFB02 ux of the process with Cl2 gas drastically decreased to 7% of that with Cl2 plasma owing to the elimination of Cl2 plasma radiation in the modi/uniFB01 cation step. Finally, the sample etched by ALE using Cl2 gas was analyzed via CL. The NBE signal intensity of GaN and AlGaN etched by ALE using Cl2 gas was twice that obtained when using Cl2 plasma. However, the damage amount in ALE using Cl2 gas was larger than that in RIE because of the residual Cl on the chamber wall and the longer process time. It was dif /uniFB01 cult to reduce the photon damage in ALE to less than that in RIE.

## IV. SUMMARY

We investigated plasma-induced damages on AlGaN/GaN stacked layers during RIE and ALE processes. In the case of RIE, the surface roughness of the layers etched using the Cl2/Ar gas-mixture plasma increased with an increase in the etched depth, and nitrogen was desorbed from the surface of the AlGaN layer. On the other hand, these deteriorations were not observed in the ALE process at the same etched depth. It was, however, revealed that photon damages in ALE were larger than those in RIE owing to the longer plasma irradiation time of the modi /uniFB01 cation and/or removal steps. As surface roughness and residual thickness are the most critical factors in /uniFB02 uencing device operations, we conclude that ALE could be a promising etching process for next-generation power devices.
