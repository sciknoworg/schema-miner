## Atomic Layer Etching?

Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) is a cyclic, self-limiting process that enables precise removal of material  at  the  atomic  scale.  It  operates  through  sequential  surface  reactions,  typically involving  a  modification  step  followed  by  a  removal  step.  The  self-limiting  nature  of ALE ensures controlled etching with minimal surface damage, making it an essential technique in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. The ability to precisely remove material at the atomic level  allows ALE  to  be  utilized  in  various  applications  where  precision  and  selectivity  are crucial.

In the context  of simulation,  ALE  is modelled  to  better  understand  its  fundamental mechanisms, optimize process parameters, and predict etch rates and uniformity. Computational techniques such as molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and density functional theory are frequently employed to replicate and  analyse ALE behaviour. These  simulations  aid  in  refining  ALE  recipes  and  predicting  process  outcomes  before experimental  validation,  reducing  the  need  for  extensive  physical  testing  and  accelerating process development.

One  of  the  defining  characteristics  of  ALE  is  its  self-limiting  reaction  mechanism,  which ensures that each reaction step saturates at the monolayer level, leading to controlled and uniform material removal. The process offers flexibility in controlling anisotropic and isotropic etching, depending on whether plasma-based or thermal ALE is employed. Another critical advantage of ALE is its ability to minimize surface damage, preserving the integrity of the underlying material, unlike conventional etching techniques. Additionally, ALE exhibits high material  selectivity,  allowing  for  the  precise  removal  of  targeted  materials  while  leaving adjacent  structures  unaffected.  These  properties  make ALE  highly  suitable  for  nanoscale device fabrication, where precision is paramount.

## Inputs and Outputs of the ALE Process

The ALE process requires several key inputs to function effectively. The primary inputs include chemical precursors, often halogen-based gases such as chlorine (Cl2) or hydrogen fluoride (HF), or plasma species in the case of plasma-enhanced ALE. An external energy source, whether thermal energy for thermal ALE or plasma excitation for plasma ALE, is necessary to drive the process. The substrate material, which can be a semiconductor, dielectric, or metal film, is the target for etching. Additionally, process parameters such as temperature, pressure, gas flow rates, plasma power (if applicable), and exposure time must be carefully controlled to maintain process stability and efficiency.

The outputs of the ALE process include the precisely etched material, where atomic-scale layers are selectively removed from the surface. By-products in the form of volatile compounds are  also produced  and  must  be  efficiently  evacuated  from  the  chamber  to  prevent contamination. Additionally, the surface of the material undergoes chemical modifications that can  influence  subsequent  processing  steps,  necessitating  careful  planning  of  post-etch treatments.

To  ensure  optimal  performance  of  the  ALE  process,  several  factors  must  be  carefully managed.  The  process  window  must  be  optimized  by  selecting  appropriate  precursors, temperatures,  and  exposure times  to  maintain the  self-limiting  behaviour  of  the  reactions. Proper surface activation is often required to enhance surface reactivity and ensure uniform etching across the entire substrate. Selectivity is another critical factor, as controlling precursor chemistry  and  energy  input  is  essential  to  selectively  etch  target  materials  while  avoiding unintended damage to adjacent layers.

Understanding  the  trade-offs  between  plasma-based ALE  and  thermal ALE  is  crucial  for selecting  the  appropriate  method  for  a  given  application.  Plasma-enhanced ALE  provides higher etch rates and anisotropic control, while thermal ALE offers damage-free etching with more uniform material removal. Maintaining stable chamber conditions, including pressure control, precursor flow, and exhaust management, is essential for reproducibility and process stability. Finally, validating simulation models with experimental data ensures that computational  predictions  accurately  represent  real-world  process  behaviour,  leading  to improved process development and refinement.

## Density Functional Theory - From review paper https://doi.org/10.1515/ntrev-2022-0084

DFT is  applied  in  material  science  to  compute  the  electronic  configurations  of  solids  and atoms.  It  is  defined  as  a  quantum  mechanical  (QM)  modelling  methodology  applied  in chemistry, material science, and physics to describe the electronic structures of a many-body system  (predominantly  the  ground  state),  precisely  atoms,  the  condensed  states,  and molecules. Nowadays, it is used in binding energy calculations of molecules and the band structure of solids in chemistry and physics, respectively. In atomic layer deposition, the DFT can be used to explore the reaction mechanism between the first precursor and the substrate. It  can be used to calculate the electron density and electronic configurations at this stage. Where the first precursor fails to bond with the surface of the substrate, DFT can be used to explain why this happens. DFT calculations can also be used to improve the conditions of the substrate so that it is favourable for bonding with the precursor. After purging the by-products and excess first precursor, the second precursor is pumped into the reaction chamber. DFT can be used to map the reaction pathway between the first and second precursors. It can be used to predict the nature of the reaction and the by-products from this reaction. DFT can be applied to predict the thin film's mechanical and electrical properties. DFT can be used to validate  the  experimental  conclusions,  differentiate  between  possible  opportunities  to  be explored, or create a foundation for experiments.

## Molecular Dynamics - From review paper https://doi.org/10.1515/ntrev-2022-0084

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a computational procedure for computing the transport properties and equilibrium of a classical many-body system. MD focuses on the dynamics of atoms,  molecules,  and  clusters  in  the  condensed  and  liquid  states.  It  is  used  in  many engineering  and  science  disciplines  like  chemistry,  physics,  and  materials  engineering  to determine the motion and equilibrium conditions of each atom or molecule. During the first stage of the atomic layer deposition process where the first precursor is forced into the reaction chamber, molecular dynamics calculations can be used to predict the kinetic properties of molecules such as material structure and complex and the stability of the substrate-precursor 1  bond.  It  can  predict  the  binding  energy  between  the  substrate  and  the  first  precursor molecules. In the second stage where the by-products and excess first precursor are purged, MD can be applied to predict the mechanism of removal. In the third stage where the second precursor is pumped into the reaction chamber, MD simulations can be used to predict the nature of the reaction, the binding energy between the first and second precursor atoms, and the stability of the bond. It can also be applied in the fourth stage the same way as the third stage since these purging stages have the same principles. Molecular dynamics can be used to  predict  the  thermodynamic  properties  of  the  deposited  thin-film  material,  based  on intermolecular  interactions. The  deposited thin film  can  be  analysed  by MD  simulations  to predict free binding energy, the heat of vaporisation, and boiling point. According to Sator, the molecular  dynamics  method  is  valid  in  both  equilibrium  and  non-equilibrium  physical phenomena. Molecular dynamics is a useful computational approach that may be used in simulating various physical phenomena if there is satisfactory computation power.

## Monte Carlo

(Kinetic) Monte Carlo Simulations allow for the simulation of larger scale processes than DFT or MD as they do not explicitly include the same level of accuracy in the calculation, they do however take DFT calculation as input to their algorithm. These calculations are often used to calculate  rates  of  etching  or  the  surface  coverage  of  etchants  as  the  simulation  of  many molecules on a lager surface is very possible, where it is not with DFT or MD.
