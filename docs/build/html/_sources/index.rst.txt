   <h1>LLMs4SchemaDiscovery: A Human-in-the-Loop Workflow for Scientific Schema Mining with Large Language Models</h1>

What is Schema-miner?
*********************

Schema-miner is novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and continuous human feedback to automate and enhance schema mining task. Through an iterative process, the framework uses LLMs to extract and organize properties from unstructured text, refine schemas with expert input, and incorporate domain-specific ontologies to add semantic knowledge.
