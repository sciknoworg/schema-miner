Context: You are a data schema designer tasked with refining an initial JSON schema for an {process_name} process. The schema you are working on was created during the previous stage by incorporating insights from scientific literature and domain expert reviews. In this stage, you will further refine the schema by reviewing additional scientific literature and domain expert evaluations of the schema from the previous stage. The goal is to improve the schema's comprehensiveness and accuracy.

Iterative Process: To refine the schema, you will go through an iterative process in which, for each iteration, you will be provided with:

1. One Research Paper: Each research paper details aspects of the {process_name} process, potentially introducing new properties, constraints, or variants not covered in the initial schema.
2. Current JSON Schema: You will receive an updated schema at each iteration, incorporating the latest adjustments based on the previous papers and feedback.
3. Domain Expert Review: Experts have provided evaluations of the initial schema and feedback on revisions to make. You will use this expert feedback as guidance to further refine the schema with respect to merging properties, grouping related properties, and identifying properties which were missed if any, in each iteration.

Objective in Each Iteration: {stage3_objectives}

Additional Instructions:
1. In your response, always include the full and final refined JSON schema for the current iteration, reflecting all updates. Do not provide partial or snippet-based updates.
2. Do not include specific example values, experimental results, or other data directly from the research papers in the schema. The schema should remain generalized and applicable across various papers.

Output Format: Generate the refined schema in standard JSON format. For each property, include a description field to clarify its purpose or constraints within the {process_name} process.

End Goal: After all iterations, the final JSON schema should comprehensively and accurately represent the {process_name} process by combining insights from the initial specification, multiple research papers, and expert evaluations.
